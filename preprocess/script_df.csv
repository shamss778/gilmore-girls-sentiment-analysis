MICHELorelai,"No, I'm sorry, we're completely booked.",1
DRELLA,"Oh, no, don't move. Just ignore the tiny woman pushing the 200-pound instrument around. No, this is good, I like this. After this I'll, uh, bench press a piano, huh? Oh, that's it, lady, tie your shoe now. Yeah, don't worry, I'll wait.",1
LORELAI,"Hi, Drella, hi. I was just wondering, um, could you be, uh, nicer to the guests?",1
DRELLA,I'm sorry. Did you not want a harp player?,1
LORELAI,"Yes, I did.",1
DRELLA,And did you not want a great harp player?,1
LORELAI,"Yes, I did.",1
DRELLA,"Okay. I am a great harp player, and this is my great harp, okay. So if you're looking for someone to just be nice to the guests, get a harmonica player, or maybe some guy who whistles through his nose. Okay? Capisce?",1
DRELLA,"Oh, that is a great spot for a table. Decorator's a genius.",1
MICHELorelai,"Madame, you have no idea how desperately I'd like to help, but see, I'd have to build a room for you myself, and I am not a man who works with his hands, so the best I can do is suggest that you please, please try for another weekend. Any weekend. Ah, good, fine, the twenty- first. Hold on, I'll look. No, I'm sorry, we're completelybooked.",1
LORELAI,Has the plumber attended to room four yet?,1

LORELAI,"Hi Marco, Lorelai. Talk to me about room four. What was wrong with it?",1

MICHELorelai,Excuse me?,1
RORY,That'd be great.,1
MICHELorelai,No.,1
RORY,"Come on, Michel. I'll tell all the ladies what a stud you are.",1
MICHELorelai,Hm. I believe that memo has already been sent.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, please, Michel. Pretty please with sucre on top. I will stop talking like this.",1
MICHELorelai,Leave it. I'll look at it if I get a chance.,1
RORY,It's due tomorrow. And pay special attention to the grammar.,1
MICHELorelai,,1
RORY,"When are you going to let your parents know that you listen to the evil rock music? You're an American teenager, for God's sake.",1
LANE,"Rory, if my parents still get upset over the obscene portion size of American food, I seriously doubt I'm gonna make any inroads with Eminem.",1
LANE,I have to go to that.,1
RORY,The hayride? You're kidding.,1
LANE,My parents set me up with the son of a business associate. He's gonna be a doctor.,1
RORY,How old is he?,1
LANE,Sixteen.,1
RORY,So he's gonna be a doctor in a hundred years.,1
LANE,"Well, my parents like to plan ahead.",1
RORY,"God, you have to go to the hayride with him?",1
LANE,And his older brother.,1
RORY,"Oh, now you're kidding.",1
LANE,"Koreans never joke about future doctors. So, I guess you're not going, huh?",1

LANE,,1
TRAISTERory,,1
DRELLA,"Nice, huh?",1
WOMAN,Beautiful.,1
DRELLA,"Yeah, well, tell it to the tip jar.",1
LORELAI,Take Mrs. Langworthy's bags up to 314. Make sure the drapes are closed and there's extra soap and she wants her pillow mints now.,1
LORELAI,Sookie!,1
SOOKIE,"I'm okay, I'm okay.",1
LORELAI,"What did you do now? Oh, why aren't you watching her? No estabas cuidandola?",1

LORELAI,Oh. I need you to be more careful.,1
SOOKIE,"I know, I'm sorry. Hey, I fixed the peach sauce.",1

SOOKIE,"Oh, my stitches opened. I was using too much maple syrup. It strangled the fruit.",1
LORELAI,When did you get stitches?,1
SOOKIE,Friday night. Radish roses.,1
LORELAI,"Okay, stop moving.",1
SOOKIE,You gotta taste the sauce. You have to try it while it's still warm.,1
LORELAI,"Okay. Oh, Sookie, I need you to be more careful. I need there to be fewer accidents.",1
SOOKIE,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, dear God Almighty. That's incredible!",1
SOOKIE,I want to put it on the waffles tomorrow morning for breakfast.,1
LORELAI,I want to take a bath in that sauce!,1
SOOKIE,I will make more!,1
LORELAI,"Someday when we open our own inn, diabetics will line up to eat this sauce.",1
SOOKIE,Won't that be great?,1
LORELAI,"Yeah. But the key to someday achieving that dream is for you to stay alive long enough so we can actually open an inn, you understand?",1
SOOKIE,"Yes, I understand.",1
LORELAI,"All right. So, now, let's get you up and to the doctor, on three. One-two-three.",1
SOOKIE,Ow!,1
LORELAI,What?,1
SOOKIE,,1
LANE,"Well, was it a good color at least?",1
RORY,It had sparkles in it.,1
LANE,Wow.,1
RORY,And it smelled like bubble gum when it dried.,1
LANE,"Oh, well, there's no way Mark Twain can compete with that.",1
LANE,"Mom, we're home. Did you hear something?",1
RORY,I'm not sure.,1
LANE,,1

KIM,Who's that?,1
LANE,,1
KIM,Oh.,1
RORY,"Wow, I can hear the disappointment from here.",1
LANE,"Oh, come on. Stop it.",1
RORY,"You know, it sucks that after all these years your mom still hates me.",1
LANE,She doesn't hate you.,1
RORY,She hates my mother.,1
LANE,She doesn't trust unmarried women.,1
RORY,You're unmarried.,1
LANE,,1
KIM,"Go upstairs. Tea is ready. I have muffins - no dairy, no sugar, no wheat. You have to soak them in tea to make them soft enough to bite but they're very healthy. So, how was school? None ofthe girls get pregnant, drop out?",1
LANE,Not that we know of.,1
RORY,,1
KIM,What?,1
LANE,,1
KIM,Boys don't like funny girls.,1
RORY,Noted.,1
MAN,,1
KIM,We're here! We're coming! Have the muffins. Made from sprouted wheat. Only good 24 hours. Everything's half off!,1
MAN,,1
KIM,Over here!,1
MAN,,1
KIM,By the chair!,1
MAN,,1
SALVADORory,Careful!,1
SOOKIE,"I'm okay. Peppers, peppers, peppers.",1
SALVADORory,Mike!,1
SOOKIE,"Okay, hello little vegetables, come with me. I got it. Okay, where's my glaze.",1
SALVADORory,In the counter.,1
SOOKIE,"On the counter. On, not in, not in the counter. Okay, good, all right. My sauce. Whoo, that's pretty good. Hello, a little bit of greens. Okay, okay. Hello, my little babies. You like that? A little bit of juice. Okay. You're very pretty. Okay.",1
SALVADORory,"Mike, Mike!",1
LORELAI,Sookie!,1
LORELAI,Ooh. It's here! It happened! She did it!,1
SOOKIE,"Okay, I'm gonna need a little bit longer sentence.",1
LORELAI,The Chilton school. Rory got in.,1
SOOKIE,Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!,1
LORELAI,"I know. Look. ""Dear Ms. Gilmore, We are happy to inform you that we have a vacancy at Chilton Preparatory starting immediately. Due to your daughter's excellent credentials and your enthusiastic pursuit of her enrollment"" - I offered to do the principal to get her in - ""we would be happy to accept her as soon as the first semester's tuition has been received.""",1
SOOKIE,This is very exciting!,1
LORELAI,Is something burning?,1
SOOKIE,"My bangs, earlier. Go on, go on, go on.",1
LORELAI,This is it. She can finally go to Harvard like she's always wanted and get the education that I never got and get to do all the things that I never got to do and then I can resent her for it and we can finally have a normal mother-daughter relationship.,1
SOOKIE,"Oh, good.",1
RORY,Mom?,1
LORELAI,Oh!,1
RORY,You're happy.,1
LORELAI,Yeah.,1

RORY,Mom?,1
LORELAI,"You did it, babe. You got in.",1
RORY,"How did this happen? You didn't. . .with the principal, did you?",1
LORELAI,"No, honey, that was a joke. They have an open spot. You're gonna start on Monday.",1
RORY,Really?,1
LORELAI,Really.,1
RORY,"I don't believe this! Oh my God, I'm going to Chilton!",1
LORELAI,Yeah.,1
RORY,"Sookie, I'm going to Chilton!",1
SOOKIE,I'll make cookies. Protestants love oatmeal.,1
RORY,I have to call Lane.,1
RORY,I love you.,1
LORELAI,I love you.,1
LORELAI,My girl's going to Chilton,1
SOOKIE,Yeah. Rory's going to Chilton!,1
SOOKIE,,1
LORELAI,"Michel, the phone.",1
MICHELorelai,Mmhmm. It rings.,1
LORELAI,Can you answer it?,1
MICHELorelai,No. People are particularly stupid today. I can't talk to any more of them.,1
LORELAI,You know who's really nice to talk to? The people at the unemployment agency.,1
MICHELorelai,,1
LORELAI,,1
LORELAI,What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?,1
SOOKIE,You can have anything I own. My car! Sell my car.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, sweetie, no one wants your car.",1
SOOKIE,Yeah.,1
LORELAI,"There's something I haven't thought of, I know there is. There's something out there staring me right in the face. I just. . .I haven't seen it.",1
SOOKIE,"You know, you might consider calling your par--",1
LORELAI,No.,1
SOOKIE,But I don't think you have a --,1
LORELAI,Stop.,1
SOOKIE,You can at least go and --,1
LORELAI,Uh.,1
SOOKIE,"Okay, can I say one more thing? I think it's your only option.",1
LORELAI,"Sookie, there are several chapters from a Stephen King novel I'd reenact before I'd resort to that option.",1
SOOKIE,"Okay, dropped. Dropped.",1
LORELAI,Thank you.,1
RORY,Mom? So what do you think?,1
SOOKIE,"Wow, it makes you look smart!",1
RORY,"Okay, no more wine for you. Mom?",1
LORELAI,You look like you were swallowed by a kilt.,1
RORY,"Fine, you can hem it. A little.",1
LORELAI,Ooh.,1
RORY,Only a little.,1
LORELAI,Okay. Or I could hem it a lot.,1
RORY,"No, you're not. I don't want it to be too short.",1
RORY,I can't believe tomorrow's my last day at Stars Hollow High.,1
LORELAI,I know.,1
RORY,Today I was so excited I dressed for gym.,1
LORELAI,You're kidding!,1
RORY,And I played volleyball.,1
LORELAI,With other people?,1
RORY,And I learned that all this time I was avoiding group sports?,1
LORELAI,Yeah?,1
RORY,Was very smart because I suck at them.,1
LORELAI,"Well, yeah, you got that from me.",1
SOOKIE,Where's your paté?,1
LORELAI,At Zsa Zsa Gabor's house.,1
SOOKIE,Right. I'm going to the store because you have nothing. You feel like duck?,1
LORELAI,"Ooh, if it's made with chicken, absolutely.",1
SOOKIE,I'll be back.,1
LORELAI,Bye.,1
LORELAI,All right. This will give you an idea. Go see how you like it.,1
RORY,,1
LORELAI,"Hi, Mom.",1
EMILY,"Lorelai, my goodness, this is a surprise. Is it Easter already?",1
LORELAI,"No, I just, uh, finished up my business class and I thought I would stop by.",1
EMILY,To see me?,1
LORELAI,Yes.,1
EMILY,"Well, isn't that nice. Come in .",1
LORELAI,Thanks.,1
LORELAI,The place looks great.,1
EMILY,It hasn't changed.,1
LORELAI,"Well, there you go. How are the girls at the bridge club?",1
EMILY,Old.,1
LORELAI,Well...good.,1
EMILY,You said you were taking a business class?,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, mmhmm, yeah. I'm taking a business class at the college twice a week. I'm sure I told you.",1
EMILY,"Well, if you're sure then you must have. Would you like some tea?",1
LORELAI,I would love some coffee.,1
RICHARD,Emily? I'm home.,1
EMILY,We're in here.,1
LORELAI,"Hi, Dad.",1
RICHARD,"What is it, Christmas already?",1
EMILY,Lorelai was taking a business class at the college today and decided to drop in to see us.,1
RICHARD,What business class?,1
EMILY,"Well, she told us about it, dear, remember?",1
RICHARD,No.,1
LORELAI,"Well, actually, I came here for a reason. Dad, would you mind sitting down for a minute?",1
RICHARD,You need money.,1
LORELAI,I have a situation.,1
RICHARD,You need money.,1
LORELAI,"Dad, will you just please let me get this out, okay? Um, Rory has been accepted to Chilton.",1
EMILY,"Chilton? Oh, that's a wonderful school. It's only five minutes from here.",1
LORELAI,"That's right, it is. She can start as early as Monday. Um, the problem is that they want me to put down an enrollment fee plus the first semester's tuition, and I have to do that immediately or she loses her spot.",1
RICHARD,"So, you need money.",1
LORELAI,"Yeah. But it's not for me, it's for Rory. And I fully intend to pay you back every cent. I don't ask for favors, you know that.",1
EMILY,"Oh, yes, we know.",1
RICHARD,I'll get the checkbook.,1
LORELAI,Thank you. You have no idea. Thank you.,1
EMILY,On one condition.,1
LORELAI,So close.,1
EMILY,"Since we are now financially involved in your life, I want to be actively involved in your life.",1
LORELAI,"What does that mean, Mother?",1
EMILY,I want a weekly dinner.,1
LORELAI,What?,1
EMILY,"Friday nights, you and Rory will have dinner here.",1
LORELAI,Mom...,1
EMILY,"And you have to call us once a week to give us an update on her schooling and your life. That's it. That's the condition. If you agree, you'll come to dinner tomorrow night and leave here with a check. Otherwise, I'm sorry, we can't help you.",1
LORELAI,I don't want her to know that I borrowed money from you. Can that just be between us?,1
EMILY,Does seven o'clock work for you?,1
LORELAI,,1
RORY,And we get to wear uniforms. No more having people check you out to see what jeans you're wearing 'cause everyone's dressed alike in boring clothes and just there to learn.,1
LANE,"Okay, there's academic-minded and then there's Amish.",1
RORY,Funny.,1
LANE,Thank you! So I told my mom you're changing schools.,1
RORY,Was she thrilled?,1
LANE,The party's on Friday. I gotta go. I have to have a pre-hayride cup of tea with a future doctor. How do I look? Korean?,1
RORY,Spitting image.,1
LANE,Good. Bye.,1
RORY,Bye.,1
RORY,God! You're like Ruth Gordon just standing there with a tannis root. Make a noise.,1
DEAN,Rosemary's Baby.,1
RORY,Yeah.,1
DEAN,"Well, that's a great movie. You've got good taste. Are you moving?",1
RORY,"No, just my books are.",1
DEAN,My family just moved here from Chicago.,1
RORY,Chicago. Windy. Oprah.,1
DEAN,"Yeah. Yeah, that's the place. I'm Dean.",1
RORY,"Hi. Oh, Rory. Me. That's -- that's me.",1
DEAN,Rory.,1
RORY,"Well, Lorelai technically.",1
DEAN,Lorelai. I like that.,1
RORY,"It's my mother's name, too. She named me after herself. She was lying in the hospital thinking about how men name boys after themselves all the time, you know, so why couldn't women? She says her feminism just kind of took over. Though personally I think a lot of Demerol also went into that decision. I never talk this much.",1
DEAN,"Well, I better go.",1
RORY,"Oh, sure.",1
DEAN,I have to go look for a job.,1
RORY,"Okay, good.",1
RORY,You should check with Miss Patty.,1
DEAN,What?,1
RORY,About the job. You should check with Miss Patty. She teaches dance. She was actually on Broadway once.,1
DEAN,I. . .I don't really dance much.,1
RORY,"No, no, she just kind of knows everything that's going on in town. She'll know if someone's looking.",1
DEAN,"Oh, great. Uh, thanks. Hey, what are you doing now?",1
RORY,Nothing...much. I should throw this away at some point.,1
DEAN,"Well, maybe you could show me where this Miss Patty's place is.",1
RORY,"Yeah, I guess so. I really don't have anything important to. . .let's go.",1
DEAN,"So, have you lived here all your life?",1
RORY,"Yes. Well, pretty much. I was actually born in Hartford.",1
DEAN,"Well, that's not far.",1
RORY,Thirty minutes with no traffic.,1
DEAN,Really?,1
RORY,I timed it.,1
DEAN,"Okay, then.",1
RORY,"So, do you like cake?",1
DEAN,What?,1
RORY,They make really good cakes here. They're very...round.,1
DEAN,"Okay, I'll rememb er that.",1
RORY,Good. Make a note. You wouldn't want to forget where the round cakes are.,1
DEAN,"So, how are you liking Moby d*ck?",1
RORY,"Oh, it's really good.",1
DEAN,Yeah?,1
RORY,"Yeah, it's my first Melville.",1
DEAN,Cool.,1
RORY,"I mean, I know it's kind of cliché to pick Moby d*ck as your first Melville but. . .hey, how did you know I was reading Moby d*ck?",1
DEAN,"Uh, well, I've been watching you.",1
RORY,Watching me?,1
DEAN,"I mean, not in a creepy, like, ""I'm watching you"" sort of way. I just -- I've noticed you.",1
RORY,Me?,1
DEAN,Yeah.,1
RORY,When?,1
DEAN,Every day. After school you come out and you sit under that tree there and you read. Last week it was Madame Bo vary. This week it's Moby d*ck.,1
RORY,But why would you --,1
DEAN,"Because you're nice to look at, and because you've got unbelievable concentration.",1
RORY,What?,1
DEAN,"Last Friday these two guys were tossing around a ball and one guy nailed the other right in the face. I mean, it was a mess, blood everywhere, the nurse came out, the place was in chaos, his girlfriend was all freaking out, and you just sat there and read. I mean, you never even looked up. I thought, ""I have never seen anyone read so intensely before in my entire life. I have to meet that girl.""",1
RORY,Maybe I just didn't look up because I'm unbelievably self-centered.,1
DEAN,"Maybe, but I doubt it.",1
RORY,"So, did I ask if you like cake?",1
DEAN,"Yeah, you did.",1
RORY,,1
LORELAI,"So, you were late getting home tonight.",1
RORY,"Yeah, I went to the library.",1
LORELAI,"Oh. Oh, I forgot to tell you, we're having dinner with your grandparents tomorrow night.",1
RORY,We are?,1
LORELAI,Mmhmm.,1
RORY,But it's September.,1
LORELAI,So?,1
RORY,So what holiday's in September?,1
LORELAI,"Look, it's not a holiday thing. It's just dinner, okay?",1
RORY,"Fine, sorry.",1
LUKE,Red meat can k*ll you. Enjoy.,1
LORELAI,"So, I finished hemmin g your skirt today. A grunt of acknowledgment might be nice.",1
RORY,"I don't understand why we're going to dinner tomorrow night. I mean, what if I had plans? You didn't even ask me.",1
LORELAI,"Well, if you had plans I would have known.",1
RORY,How?,1
LORELAI,"Well, you would have told me.",1
RORY,I don't tell you everything. I have my own things.,1
LORELAI,"Fine, you have things.",1
RORY,That's right. I have things.,1
LORELAI,"Hey, I had dibs on being the b*tch tonight.",1
RORY,Just tonight?,1
LORELAI,What the hell is wrong with you?,1
RORY,I'm not sure I want to go to Chilton.,1
LORELAI,What?,1
RORY,The timing is just really bad.,1
LORELAI,The timing is bad?,1
RORY,"And the bus ride to and from Hartford, it's like thirty minutes each way.",1
LORELAI,I can't believe what I'm hearing.,1
RORY,"Plus, I don't think we should be spending that money right now. I mean, I know Chilton's got to be costing you a lot.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, you have no idea.",1
RORY,All of your money should be going toward buying an inn with Sookie.,1
LORELAI,What about college? What about Harvard?,1
RORY,We don't know that I can't get into Harvard if I stay where I am.,1
LORELAI,"Okay, enough. Enough of the crazy talk, okay? I appreciate your concern but I have this covered.",1
RORY,I still don't want to go.,1
LORELAI,Why?,1
RORY,Because I don't.,1
LORELAI,I have to get out of here.,1
RORY,,1
PATTY,"One-two-three. One-two-three. One-two-three. It's a waltz, ladies. Susie, do you have to tinkle? Then uncross your legs, darling. Oh, Rory, good. I think I found a job for your male friend.",1
LORELAI,,1
PATTY,They need a stock boy at the supermarket. I already talked to Taylor Doose about him. You just send him around tomorrow.,1
RORY,"Okay, thanks.",1
LORELAI,,1
PATTY,,1
PATTY,"Hands in the air, not in the nose.",1
LORELAI,,1
LORELAI,"This is about a boy, of course. I can't believe I didn't see it. All this talk about money and bus rides. You got a thing going with a guy and you don't want to leave school.",1
RORY,I'm going to bed.,1
LORELAI,"God, I'm so dense. That should have been my first thought. After all, you're me.",1
RORY,I'm not you.,1
LORELAI,Really? Someone willing to throw important life experiences out the window to be with a guy. It sounds like me to me.,1
RORY,Whatever.,1
LORELAI,So who is he?,1
RORY,There's no guy!,1
LORELAI,"Dark hair, romantic eyes? Looks a little dangerous?",1
RORY,This conversation is over.,1
LORELAI,"Tattoos are good, too!",1
RORY,"I don't want to change schools because of all the reasons I've already told you a thousand times. If you don't want to believe me, that's fine. Goodnight.",1
LORELAI,"Does he have a motorcycle? 'Cause if you're gonna throw your life away, he better have a motorcycle!",1
LORELAI,"Well, I think that went pretty well, don't you?",1
RORY,Thanks for the knock.,1
LORELAI,"Listen, can we just start all over, okay? You tell me all about the guy and I promise not to let my head explode, huh? Rory, please talk to me. Okay, I'll talk. Don't get me wrong. Guys are great. I am a huge fan of guys. You don't get knocked up at sixteen being indifferent to guys. But, babe, guys are always going to be there. This school isn't. It's more important. It has to be more important.",1
RORY,I'm going to sleep.,1
LORELAI,"Rory. You've always been the sensible one in this house, huh? I need you to remember that feeling now. You will kick your own butt later if you blow this.",1
RORY,"Well, it's my butt.",1
LORELAI,Good comeback.,1
RORY,Thank you.,1
LORELAI,"You're welcome. Rory, come on.",1
RORY,"I don't want to talk about this. Could you please, please just leave me alone?",1
LORELAI,"Okay, fine. We always had a democracy in this house. We never did anything unless we both agreed. But now I guess I'm going to have to play the mom card. You are going to Chilton whether you want to or not. Monday morning, you will be there, end of story.",1
RORY,We'll see.,1
LORELAI,,1
SOOKIE,I swear I don't know what happened.,1
LORELAI,It's not important.,1
SOOKIE,I made that dish a hundred times. It never exploded.,1
LORELAI,"Please, forget it.",1
SOOKIE,"Oh, God, I k*lled a Viking. Oh, you should fire me, or make me pay the cost of a new stoveout of my paycheck.",1
LORELAI,"Well, whatever you want.",1
SOOKIE,I can't afford a new stove! Those things are expensive.,1
LORELAI,"Sookie, please, I am begging you, pull yourself together, okay? I got no sleep last night and I think I put my contacts in backwards.",1
SOOKIE,"Rory's still mad at you, huh?",1
LORELAI,"Hey, I'm not so crazy about her either.",1
SOOKIE,It was a fight. Mothers and daughters fight.,1
LORELAI,"No, we don't fight. We never fight.",1
MICHELorelai,"You told me to tell you when your daughter arrived. Well, she's here and she's sitting in my chair.",1
LORELAI,Hold on just a minute.,1
MICHELorelai,"And you are the one left standing. That is a funny, funny thing, no?",1
LORELAI,"Hey, no muumuu today. You know what's weird, I kind of miss it.",1
RORY,You left me a n ote to meet you here.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, I thought you might want to work a couple hours, make a little extra cash.",1
RORY,Fine.,1
LORELAI,"Aw, you're not gonna give me the ""Mommy Dearest"" treatment forever, are ya?",1
RORY,"You wanted me here, I'm here. Should I do something or what?",1
LORELAI,"Yeah, go home. Dinner's at seven. Be ready to go.",1
RORY,Fine.,1
LORELAI,Fine.,1
MICHELorelai,,1
RORY,"So, do we go in or do we just stand here reenacting The Little Match Girl?",1
LORELAI,"Okay, look, I know you and me are having a thing here and I know you hate me but I need you to be civil, at least through dinner and then on the way home you can pull a Menendez. Deal?",1
RORY,Fine.,1
RORY,"Hi, Grandma.",1
EMILY,"Well, you're right on time.",1
LORELAI,"Yeah, yeah, no traffic at all.",1
EMILY,I can't tell you what a treat it is to have you girls here.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, well, we're excited, too.",1
EMILY,Is that a collector's cup or can I throw it away for you?,1
LORELAI,Oh.,1
EMILY,"In the kitchen, please. So, I want to hear all about Chilton.",1
RORY,"Well, I haven't actually started yet.",1
EMILY,"Richard, look who's here.",1
RICHARD,Rory. You're tall.,1
RORY,I guess.,1
RICHARD,"Well, what's your height?",1
RORY,"5'7"".",1
RICHARD,That's tall. She's tall.,1
LORELAI,"Hi, Dad.",1
RICHARD,"Lorelai, your daughter's tall.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, I know. It's freakish. We're thinking of having her studied at M.I.T.",1
RICHARD,Ah.,1
EMILY,"Champagne, anyone?",1
LORELAI,"Oh, that's fancy.",1
EMILY,"Well, it's not every day that I have my girls here for dinner on a day the banks are open. A toast - to Rory entering Chilton and an exciting new phase in her life.",1
RICHARD,"Here, here.",1
EMILY,"Mmm. Well, let's sit everyone. This is just wonderful. An education is the most important thing in the world, next to family.",1
LORELAI,"And pie. Joke, joke.",1
EMILY,,1
EMILY,"Rory, how do you like the lamb?",1
RORY,It's good.,1
EMILY,Too dry?,1
RORY,"No, it's perfect.",1
LORELAI,"Potatoes could use a little salt, though.",1
EMILY,Excuse me?,1
RORY,"So, Grandpa, how's the insurance biz?",1
RICHARD,"Oh, people die, we pay. People crash cars, we pay. People lose a foot, we pay.",1
LORELAI,"Well, at least you have your new slogan.",1
RICHARD,And how are things at the motel?,1
LORELAI,The inn? They're great.,1
EMILY,Lorelai's the executive manager now. Isn't that wonderful?,1
RICHARD,"Speaking of which, Christopher called yesterday.",1
LORELAI,Speaking of which? How is that a speaking of which?,1
RICHARD,"He's doing very well in California. His Internet start-up goes public next month. This could mean big things for him. Very talented man, your father.",1
LORELAI,She knows.,1
RICHARD,"He always was a smart one, that boy. You must take after him.",1
LORELAI,"Speaking of which, I'm gonna get a Coke. Or a knife.",1
LORELAI,"Hi, how are you doing?",1
RORY,I think I'm gonna go talk to her -,1
EMILY,"No, I'll go. You stay and keep your grandfather company.",1
EMILY,"Lorelai, come back to the table.",1
LORELAI,Is this what it's gonna be like every Friday night? I come over and let the two of you attack me?,1
EMILY,You're being very dramatic.,1
LORELAI,Dramatic? Were you at that table just now?,1
EMILY,"Yes, I was, and I think you took what your father said the wrong way.",1
LORELAI,The wrong way? How could I have taken it the wrong way? What was open to interpretation?,1
EMILY,Keep your voice down.,1
LORELAI,"No, Mother. I can't take it anymore. Tonight just seems like a nightmare.",1
EMILY,You're dripping all over the floor.,1
LORLEAI,Why do you pounce on every single thing I say?,1
EMILY,That's absurd. You barely uttered a word all night.,1
LORELAI,That's not true.,1
EMILY,You said pie.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, come on.",1
EMILY,You did. All I heard you say was pie.,1
LORELAI,Why would he bring up Christopher? Was that really necessary?,1
EMILY,He likes Christopher.,1
LORELAI,"Isn't that interesting? Because, as I remember, when Christopher got me pregnant, Dad didn't like him so much.",1
EMILY,"Oh, well, please, you were sixteen. What were we supposed to do - throw you a party? We were disappointed. The two of you had such bright futures.",1
LORELAI,Yes. And by not getting married we got to keep those bright futures.,1
EMILY,"When you get pregnant, you get married. A child needs a mother and a father.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, Mom. Do you think that Christopher would have his own company right now if we'd gotten married? Do you think he would be anything at all?",1
EMILY,"Yes, I do. Your father would have put him in the insurance business and you'd be living a lovely life right now.",1
LORELAI,He didn't want to be in the insurance business and I am living a lovely life right now.,1
EMILY,"That's right, far away from us.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, here we go.",1
EMILY,You took that girl and completely shut us out of your life.,1
LORELAI,You wanted to control me.,1
EMILY,You were still a child.,1
LORELAI,"I stopped being a child the minute the strip turned pink, okay? I had to figure out how to live. I found a good job.",1
EMILY,As a maid. With all your brains and talent.,1
LORELAI,I worked my way up. I run the place now. I built a life on my own with no help from anyone.,1
EMILY,"Yes, and think of where you would have been if you'd accepted a little help, hmm? And where Rory would have been. But no, you were always too proud to accept anything from anyone.",1
LORELAI,"Well, I wasn't too proud to come here to you two begging for money for my kid's school, was I?",1
EMILY,,1
RORY,Mom?,1
LORELAI,I'm okay. I just. . .do I look shorter? 'Cause I feel shorter.,1
RORY,"Hey, how 'bout I buy you a cup of coffee?",1
LORELAI,,1
RORY,"So, nice dinner at the grandparents' house.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, her dishes have never been cleaner.",1
RORY,You and Grandma seemed to have a nice talk.,1
LORELAI,How much did you hear?,1
RORY,"Not much. You know, snippets.",1
LORELAI,Snippets?,1
RORY,Little snippets.,1
LORELAI,So basically everything?,1
RORY,"Basically, yes.",1
LORELAI,"Well, the best laid plans.",1
RORY,I think it was really brave of you to ask them for money.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, I so do not want to talk about it.",1
RORY,How many meals is it gonna take 'til we're off the hook?,1
LORELAI,"I think the deli spread at my funeral will be the last one. Hey, wait, does that mean ",1
RORY,Can't let a perfectly good plaid skirt go to waste.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, honey, you won't be sorry.",1
LORELAI,"Wow, you look nice. Really nice.",1
LUKE,"I had a meet ing earlier at the bank. They like collars. You look nice, too.",1
LORELAI,I had a flagellation to go to.,1
LUKE,"So, what'll you have?",1
LORELAI,"Coffee, in a vat.",1
RORY,,1
LUKE,That's quite a refined palate you got there.,1
LORELAI,"Behold the healing powers of a bath. So, tell me about the guy.",1
RORY,"You know what's really special about our relationship? The total understanding about the need for one's privacy. I mean, you really understand boundaries.",1
LORELAI,So tell me ab out the guy.,1
RORY,Mom!,1
LORELAI,Is he dreamy?,1
RORY,"Oh, that's so Nick at Night.",1
LORELAI,"Well, I'm gonna find out anyway.",1
RORY,Really? How?,1
LORELAI,I'll spy.,1
LUKE,"Coffee. . .fries. I can't stand it. This is so unhealthy. Rory, please, put down that cup of coffee. You do not want to grow up to be like your mom.",1
RORY,"Sorry, too late.",1
LORELAI,So tell me ab out the guy.,1
RORY,"Check, please.",1
LORELAI,"No, really, are you embarrassed to bring him home?",1
RORY,I'm not embarrassed.,1
LORELAI,Does he talk at all?,1

Rory : Thank you. L : Don't move, please. R : So, Why are you insisting on doing this. L : Well, because you're going to be starting private school tomorrow. R : Yes, but I'm going to be wearing shoes. Nobody's going to see my feet. L : Okay, But everybody knows that private school girls are bad. And bad girls always wear red nail polish. L : Are you nervous? R : About what? L : About starting Chilton. R : Well I wasn't until I heard about all those bad girls. Lane : You guys! XTC. Apple Venus Volume 2. R : But you only finished half my toes! L : Who cares?! You're going to be wearing shoes anyway!",1

It's a quarter to six. R : No it's not! L : Yes it is! I set the clock for a quarter to six so it's.. L : It's 7:10! R : I can't be late on my first day of school. Do you know what happens to people when they're late on their first day? L : It's shorter? R : They're labeled 'The late girl'. L : Ohh! So dramatic. Where's the bathroom? R : We have to go! What if there's traffic? Mom! L : I had this all planned. I was gonna get up early. I was gonna get coffee. I was gonna take a shower. I was gonna pick up my clothes from the dry cleaners. L : Oh my god. My clothes. R : What?! L : I don't have any clean clothes. R : It's 7:15. L : All my nice things were dirty. R : It's 7:16. L : I was gonna wear my blue suit with the flippy skirt.

I'm sorry! I love the rodeo! The rodeo rules! L : I am so done with plans. I am never ever making one again. It never works. I spend the day obsessing over why it didn't work and what I could've done differently. L : I'm analyzing all my shortcomings when all I really need to be doing is vowing to never ever make a plan ever again which I'm doing now. Having, once again, been the innocent victim of my own stupid plans. L : God, I need some coffee. R : I rememb er it being smaller. L : Yeah. And less.. R : Off with their heads. L : Ah.",1
Rory,"What are you looking at? L : I'm just trying to see if there's a hunchback up in that bell tower. R : So, how do I look? L : You look great. R : Really? L : Really. You are an amazing kid. You have earned this. You just go in there and show them what smart really is. I love you. Call me if you need me.",1
Rory,"You're kidding, right? L : No! Call me if you need anything. I'm great at making up dirty cheers. R : You have to go in with me. L : Rory, come on. R : You have to meet the headmaster. L : Well, look at me! I can't meet anyone who does anything in there. I look like that chick from the'Dukes of Hazzard'. R : This is my first day. You are not getting out of going in there with me. L : Good morning! L : Oh, well, we're gonna be best friends. L : So, where do we go. R : Uh, the Ambroise building. L : Which is? R : The big, scary one. L : Oh great! Thanks for the input. Man : lost? L : Oh, yeah. We're looking for the headmaster's office in the Ambroise building. Man : Ah, okay. Well, this is it right here. Down the stairs, make a left and the headmaster's office is at the end of the hall. L : Great. Thank you. Man : You're welcome. Man : Uh, I'm Ian Jack. My daughter Julia goes to school here. L : Hi! I'm Lorelai Gilmore. This is my daughter, Rory. Ian : Your daughter? Really. Wow, that's great. Uh  I mean, daughters are a great thing. L : We're big fans. Ian : Yeah. So, is your husband here? I'd love to meet him. L : Um, no. I'm not married. I'd love to meet your wife, though. Ian : I'm divorced. L : Shame.R : Excuse me. I really got to.. L : Right! We gotta go meet the big guy, and I gotta get back to work. Ian : Where do you work? L : At an inn. The Independence Inn. I run it. Ian : Really? L : In a different outfit, of course. Ian : Ha. Well, It was nice to meet you, Lorelai. Good luck in school, Rory. I'll tell Julia to look out for you. R : Great, thanks. Ian : See you. L : What a nice, nice man. R : You're feeling pretty good about yourself right now, aren't you. L : Yeah R : Do you want me to get you a mirror? L : I'm back. Let's go. L : Oh, good. More big stuff. R : Turn left. L : Oh L : You ready? R : No. L : You ready?R : Yes. L : Um.. Excuse me. Oh! How.. Wow. Hi. I.. I'm Lorelai Gilmore. This is my daughter, Lorelai Gilmore. I named her after me. I was in the hospital all whacked out on Demerol. Never mind. B-B-But we call her 'Rory'. It's short for Lorelai or even 'Hey, you' depending on the.. Is the headmaster here? Secretary : One moment. L : See, that's what happens when you go to bed with your makeup on. Secretary : Headmaster Charleston will see you now. L : Great. Thanks. Headmaster : Ms. Gilmore, I'm headmaster Charleston. L : Hi. Wow. It's really nice to meet .. Mom. Uh, ex.. What are you doing here? Grandmother : I came to wish my granddaughter luck on her first day of school. Rory, you look wonderful in that uniform! L : You didn't have to come al l the way out here, Mom. Grandmother : This gave me a c hance to make sure that Hanlin here takes good care of Rory. L : You're Hanlin. Headmaster : Hanlin Charleston. Grandmother : Hanlin's wife and I are on the symphony fundraising committee together. L : Wow. That's great. Headmaster : Your father and I are golf rivals. We're still fighting it out to see which one is worse. Grandmother : Oh, yes. We're all old friends. L : Well, there's nothing like friends. Especially if they're old. Headmaster : Would you like to take off your coat and have a seat? L : Oh, no. No, I'm fine. Headmaster : I'm afraid they were a little overzealous with the furnace this morning. It's quite warm in here. L : I like it warm. Grandmother : Lorelai, take off your coat and sit down. You don't want Hanlin to think you're rude. L : Laundry day. Grandmother : Hanlin, did you know that Rory has a 4.0 grade point average? L : I'm sure he does, Mom. Grandmother : This is a very special girl. You take good care of her. Headmaster : We'll do our best, Emily. L : Rory's not going to be a problem. She's totally low maintenance. You know, like a Honda. You know, they're just easy, just.. Nice office. Grandmother : Well, I don't think we should take up anymore of your precious time. It was lovely to see you. Give Bitty our love. Headmaster : Tell Richard I'll see him at the club Sunday. Grandmother : Have a wonderful day, Rory. I want to hear all about it. Do you need a ride or is your horse parked outside? L : It's so nice to meet you. Have a great day. Headmaster : Oh, you don't want to forget your coat. L : Oh no, 'cause that would be embarrassing. Grandmother : How do you leave the house looking like that? What kind of an impression did you think you were gonna make? L : What are you doing here, mother? Grandmother : I told you, I came to put in a good word for Rory. L : She didn't need a good word.Grandmother : I'm not allowed here, is that it? L : I didn't say that. Grandmother : I'm allowed to pay for it. But I can't actually set foot on the premises. I just want to get the rules straight. How about the street. Can I drive down the street? Maybe I should just avoid the neighborhood altogether. Although my doctor is right down the block. Maybe I can get special permission if I'm bleeding. L : I'm sorry. I was just surprised to see you here. Grandmother : I thought it was important for this school to know they had a Gilmore amongst them. L : A very good thought. Grandmother : And that some of the Gilmores actually own clothing. L : And on that note, I have to get to work. I'll see you later. Grandmother : Dinner, Friday night. No spurs, please. Headmaster : You're obviously a bright girl, Miss. Gilmore. Rory : Thank you. Headmaster : Good grades. Teachers like you. Not a lot of social activities, though. Rory : Oh, well, just living at Stars Hollow is kind of a social activity, actually. Headmaster : Nothing in your school appealed to you? Rory : I work at my mother's inn after school sometimes. And I was in the German Club for a while. But there were only three of us. Then two left after seeing ""Schindler's List"". Headmaster : What are your aspirations? Rory : I want to go to Harvard to study Journalism and Political Science. Headmaster : On your way to being  Rory : Christiane Amanpour. Headmaster : Really? Rory : Yes.Headmaster : Not Cokie Roberts? Rory : No. Headmaster : Not Oprah, Rosie, or one of the women from 'The View'? Rory : No. Headmaster : Why do you wish to be Christiane Amanpour? Rory : I don't wish to be her, exactly. I just want to do what she does. Headmaster : Which is? Rory : Travel, see the world up close, report on what's really going on, and to be part of something big. Headmaster : And to be a part of something big you have to be on TV? Why not lead the police on a high speed chase, it's a quicker way to achieve this goal. Rory : Being on TV has nothing to do with it. Maybe I'll be a Journalist and write books or articles about what I see. I just want to be sure that I see something. You'll notice the debating teams also missing from my resume. Headmaster : I've known your Grandparents for quite some time. Rory : I know. Headmaster : In fact, I was at a party at their house just last week where I had the most delicious lobster puffs I've ever eaten. I'm very fond of them. Rory : That's nice. Headmaster : None of this, however, will be of any benefit to you. Chilton has one of the highest academic standards of any school in America. You may have been the smartest girl at Stars Hollow, but this is a different place. The pressures are greater, the rules are stricter, and the expectations are high. If you make it through, you will have received one of the finest educations one can get. And there should be no reason why you should not achieve all your goals. However, since you are starting late, and are not used to this highly competitive atmosphere, there is a good chance that you will fail. That is fine. Failure is a part of life. But not a part of Chilton. Understand? R : So, you liked the lobster puffs, huh. Headmaster : Take this to Miss. James in the administration office across the hall. R : Hi, I'm looking for Miss James? Miss James : Name?R : Lorelai Gilmore. But I go by Rory. Miss James : Fill this out, please. Girl 1 : Well? Girl 2 : Shut up. Girl 3 : Hurry. Please. Spiders. Girl 2 : Lorelai Gilmore. Girl 1 : Nice stripper name. Girl 2 : Formerly of Stars Hollow High School. Girl 1 : Where's that? Girl 2 : Make a left at the haystacks and follow the cows. Perfect attendance, 4.0 grade point average. Girl 3 : Bugs, dirt, twigs. Girl 2 : She's a Journalism majo r. Girl 1 : That means she's going out for the school paper. Girl 2 : Not necessarily. She's got a thousand recommendations in here. Popular with the adults. Girl 1 : And going out for the school paper. Girl 2 : You don't know she's going out for the paper. She'll never catch up. She's a month behind. Girl 1 : You can tutor her. Be like a big sister. Girl 2 : You're funny. Girl 3 : Okay, lizard, goodbye. Girl 2 : Why are they letting all these extra people in? They just take up space and screw up the curve. We don't need any new kids here. Girl 1 : Too late. Miss James : Here's your locker number, here's your schedule. Here's the rules of the school and the Chilton code of honor. Here are the words to the school song, which must be recited upon demand. This an happen anytime, anyplace. If you do it in Latin you get extra credit. Do you have any questions? R : Uh, not at the moment. Miss James : If you do, you can make an appointment with your guidance counselor, Mr. Winters. He handles everything but Bulimia and pregnancy. For that, you have to go to the nurse, or Coach Rubens. Welcome to Chilton. L : I already had the longest day of my life and it's only ten o'clock. Luke : There's no coffee. L : That's not funny. Luke : I can give you herbal tea. L : This is not an herbal tea morning. This is a coffee morning. Luke : Every morning for you is a coffee morning. L : This is a jumbo coffee morning. I need coffee in an IV. Luke : I can give you tea and a balance bar. L : Please, please, please tell me you're kidding. Luke : I'm kidding. L : You're sick. Luke : Yep. L : You're a fiend! Luke : For here or to go. L : To go please. Luke : You want to know what this stuff does to your nervous system? L : Do you have a chart? Because I love charts. Luke : Maybe next time. What happened this morning that was so awful.L : Rory started Chilton. Luke : Really? L : Yeah. What? Luke : That's how you dressed to take Rory to Chilton? That's a fancy school. L : My clothes were at the cleaners. I had the fuzzy clock and it didn't purr on time. Luke : It didn't purr? L : It's fuzzy. It purrs. Never mind. I gotta go. I had a plan, damn it. Luke : Me too. Next time you're getting tea. Miss Patty : Visualize, Ladies. It's thanksgiving day parade. You're standing on fifth avenue. There's 100 beautiful boys marching in place behind you. And there you are. You are out in front with your fabulous legs and your perfect tush. Your baton is on fire and the crowd goes nuts! Okay, cookie time. Lorelai, hi. L : Hi, Patty. Miss Patty : Isn't today Rory's first day at Chilton? L : Oh, yeah, she's there now. I just got through dropping her off. Miss Patty : Is that what you wore? L : Oh, look at the time. See you, Patty. Miss Patty : Bye. Miss Patty : Ladies, what do I see. Naked girls. No, no, keep those leotards on. This is not Brazil. L : Hello? Grandmother : Lorelai? L : Mom?Grandmother : I'm going shopping this afternoon and I'd thought I'd pick up a few things for Rory. L : Like what? Grandmother : A couple of extra skirts and tops for school. L : Ok, I already took care of that Mom. I got her two skirts and a bunch of tops. Grandmother : But there a five days in a school week. L : Are you sure? My days of the week underwear only go till Thursday. Grandmother : Is that a joke? L : Two skirts are fine. Don't bother. Grandmother : What if she gets one dirty? L : Well, then, she'll wear the other one. Grandmother : What if she gets them both dirty? L : We'll use this newfangled thing called a washing machine. The town just chipped in and bought one. My turn's Tuesday. Grandmother : What about socks? Chilton has these special logo socks. Rory should have them. And what about the school sweater. She might want that. And there's a sweater vest and a bookbag. L : Are you getting a cut of the merchandise? Grandmother : Rory should have these things. She'll be the only one who doesn't. L : She'll have them. Grandmother : I'm at least getting her the Chilton coat. Is she a size 6? L : Mom, please. Grandmother : This is a simple question, Lorelai. L : She's a six, but I'd get a size eight in case she grows. Grandmother : If she grows, I'll buy another. L : Ok, well then, a six is great. I gotta go, Mom. Bye. Teacher : And while French culture was the dominant outside cultural influence, especially for Russia's monied class, English culture also had it's impact. Tolstoy's favorite author, for instance, was.. Girl 2 : Dickens.Teacher : Yes, and last week we discovered Dostoevski's main authorial influences. Girl 2 : George Sand and Balzac. Teacher : Good. As Tolstoy commen ced writing both ""w*r and Peace"" and ""Anna Karenina"", Count Leo would turn to.. Girl 2 : ""David Copperfield"" Teacher : Correct. He would turn to ""David Copperfield"" for inspiration. Teacher : Ah, Mr. Dugray. Guy : Sir. Teacher : Nice to have you back. I hope your Grandfather's feeling better. Guy : Much better, sir. Teacher : Good. Take your seat please. Teacher : ""Great Expectations"", ""A Tale of Two Cities"", ""Little Dorrit"", all major influences on Leo Tolstoy. Guy 1 : Who's that? Guy 2 : New girl. Teachers :  of these two literary masters, Tolstoy and Dickens. Class dismissed. Guy 1 : Looks like we got ourselves a Mary. Teacher : Miss, uh, Gilmore, could you come up here please? This is last week's study material. There'll be a test on them tomorrow. But since you're new, you can take a makeup test on Monday. Will that be sufficient time? R : Monday? Sure, that's fine. Teacher : That's just an overview. You'll find it very helpful to you to borrow one of the other student's personal notes. They tend to be more detailed. R : More detailed than this? Teacher : It seems daunting right now, I know.R : No, no. It's okay. I'll be fine. Teacher : Rememb er to get those notes. They'll be a lifesaver. Girl 2 : I'm Paris. R : I didn't see you there. Where'd you come from. Paris : I know who you are, too. Lorelai Gilmore from Stars Hollow. R : You can call me Rory. Paris : Are you going out for the 'Franklin'? R : The what? Paris : Nice innocent act. At least I know you're not going out for drama club. The Franklin, the school paper, are you going out for it? R : I have to find my locker first. Paris : I'm gonna be editor next year. R : Well, good for you. Paris : I'm also the top of the class, and I intend to be valedictorian when I graduate. R : Okay. I'm going now. Paris : You'll never catch up. You'll never beat me. This school is my domain and the Franklin is my domain. And don't you ever forget that. R : I guess you're not going to let me borrow your notes, huh. Sookie : They're smaller than the last batch. Fruit Man : No, they're not. Sookie : Smaller means watery. No good peach taste. Fruit Man : No, there's plenty of peach taste being as they're, you know, peaches. Sookie : What about the ones on the bottom.Fruit Man : Oh, great. Be sure to check them all. That's it. Give every last one of them a nice good squeeze. You wouldn't actually want to leave me one that I could sell to somebody else. Wait a minute, you missed one. I'm not going to tell you which one it is. I'm just going to let your impeccably good radar  There it is, you got it. L : Okay, I look great, right? Sookie : Yes. L : This is how I was supposed to look. Good morning Jackson . Sookie : This was Rory's first day. L : I was supposed to look fabulous, and not like I'd been up all night playing quarters. Sookie : Nobody cares how you looked. L : Everybody cared. Sookie : Who? L : The other moms, the Headmaster, my mom, Luke, Miss Patty, the new fire chief with the tiny head. Sookie : Taste this. L : A little watery. Jackson : Oh! Now, you planned this! Sookie : Did you say something about your mother? L : I walked into the headmaster's office, and there she was. Sookie : Really? Why? L : Because she knew I'd wake up late and humiliate myself. Sookie : Wow, she's good. L : She's the best. Jackson : Oh, I would love to know what you're doing. Sookie : They're rolling differently, too. Because of the extra water. Jackson : Makes perfect sense. Sookie : I would ignore those women, cause the only thing that matters is that Rory got into that great school.L : She looked so amazing in her uniform. She was so excited. I just admire her so much jumping into a new school. She's my hero. Sookie : Mine too! Jackson : Oh, yeah. Sign me up. Sookie, the peaches, please. Michel : Excuse me. There's a phone call for you. If I'm to fetch you like a dog, I'd like a cookie and a raise. L : Thanks for the peach. Woman 1 : This would be absolutely wonderful. There are supposed to be darling shops all up and down this street. Oh, excuse me sir . Can you tell me where we'd find the best antiques? Michel : At your house, I'd guess. L : Mom, did I give you this number? Because I don't remember giving you this number. Yeah, well, I must be losing my mind. What can I, uh, sorry Mom, can you hold on one second? Um, Drella, can you take it down just a notch? Thanks. Okay, I'm back. Grandmother : I wanted you to known that I just bought a parking space for Rory at Chilton. L : You what? Grandmother : They are very hard to come by. But I pulled a few strings and it's all hers. L : Mom, Rory doesn't have a car. Grandmother : No, but she's got a birthday coming up soon. L : Okay, hold on a second. Um, Drella. Drella! A little softer please. Drella : Hey, do I look like I got Panasonic stamped on my ass? L : Mom, you are not buying Rory a car. Grandmother : Why not? She's a smart girl, she's responsible. L : She doesn't need one. Grandmother : She has to have a way to get around. To get to school. L : She'll be taking the bus. Grandmother : I hate that she's taking the bus. Drug dealers take the bus.L : You know what, Mom? I gotta go. Grandmother : Fine. We'll discuss this at a later date. L : Okay. Bye. Guy 1 : Hey, Mary. R : Me? Guy 1 : Yeah, you. R : My name is Rory. Guy 1 : I'm Tristin. R : Hi. Tristin : So you new? R : Yeah, first day. Tristin : Remmy's class is rough. R : Yeah, it seemed very intense. Tristin : I could loan you my notes, if that would help. R : Really? That's be great. Tristin : Yeah? How great? R : I don't know. Mr. Remmy said that getting someone's notes would be.. Tristin : I could even help you study. If you want. R : Uh, I kind of view studying as a solitary activity. But thanks. Tristin : Bye Mary. R : It's Rory. L : I completely understand.Man : Oh, do you. Because this is a brand-new car. He brings the car up and it's scratched! Boy : I just backed the car up. Man : I'd know if my car was scratched before I parked it or not. L : Let's calm down. Sir, why don't I have your car looked at tomorrow. I'm sure we can find a way to resolve this. In the meantime I would love for you to have lunch here, on me. Dessert is a must. Anything with our homemad e ice cream is delicious. Life as you know it will never be the same. What do you say? Man : I think I will. Thank you. L : Thank you. Boy : Lorelai, I swear, I didn't scratch his car. If you thought I was unreliable or a bad driver.. L : Derek. It's okay. Boy : 'Cause I can drive. L : Oh, sweetie. I am sure you can. We'll just take it over to Musky's tomorrow and have the guys look at it. I'm sure they can buff it out for nothing, okay? Boy : Okay. That's a real nice outfit you're wearing today. L : Thank you, Derek. Michel : Your faithful pooch is here to say ""Someone needs to talk with you"". L : It's not my mother, is it? Michel : It's possible. L : It's possible? Michel : There's a resemblance. L : Hi. Ian : Hi. Is this a bad time? L : No, not at all. What are you doing here? Ian : Well, I had to meet an associate for lunch, and he was coming up from New York so I thought, ""Why not meet him in a beautiful inn?"" L : Good. Enjoy your lunch. Ian : Thanks. I will. I was also wondering if maybe I could take you out to dinner sometime.L : We're a little food-obsessed, aren't we? Ian : It's the company more than the food that interests me. L : I'm flattered. Ian : Is that a yes? L : That's a  You're a dad. Ian : And you're a mom. Although I'm still finding that really hard to believe. L : No, I mean, you're a Chilton dad. Ian : Ooh, that sounds bad. L : Not bad. Just tricky. You know, Rory just started there, and I think I should let her fall in with the bad crowd before I start hooking up with the P.T.A.",1
Ian,"Well, I'm not on the P.T.A. L : See? There you go, I can't date anyone not on the P.T.A. Ian : It's just a casual dinner. L : Sorry. Ian : Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going to China for a week on business. When I get back I'm going to try again L : China. Wow. Ian : Impressed? L : No. Rome, I'd be impressed. China I'm just ""China, wow"" Ian : Lorelai Gilmore, General Manager, I'll talk to you soon. L : Have a safe trip. Ian : I will. L : He does that so well. Michel : You are making me sick. L : Aw, now, honey. You try it, I'll watch you walk away too. Michel : Stop it. L : Go on now, walk. It can't be that bad. Michel : Go away. L : No. You have to do it with a little more attitude. Make me think you mean it! Drella : That's lunch. R : Oh no! I am so sorry. Paris, please. I am so sorry. It was an accident. My locker, it just slipped. I pulled too hard.. I didn't mean to.. Is there water in that moat? Paris : Get away from me! R : Excuse me, I need Mrs. Ness, History? Boy : It's behind you. R : Of course it is. Paris : Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Tristin : Hey, Mary. Teacher : Ok, We left our projects off on Friday with Mr. Gaynor. So today we will pick up with Miss Geller. Paris : I don't have my project. Teacher : Miss Geller.. Did you have sufficient time to complete your project? Paris : Yes Teacher : And yet you don't have it done? Paris : No Teacher : You will receive an incomplete on the project. R : It's my fault. Teacher : Who are you? R : Rory Gilmore. I wrecked her project. Paris : Shut up. Teacher : I don't have a Rory Gilmore. I have a Lorelai Gilmore. R : That's me.Teacher : You are Rory and Lorelai Gilmore? R : Yes. And I wrecked her project. My locked got stuck. Paris : Just stay out of this. Teacher : Do you go by Rory or Lorelai. R : Whatever. It's not her fault. Teacher : I need you to pick one. R : One what. Teacher : One name. R : Rory. Teacher : Thank you. Rory, you wrecked Paris' project when? R : Just before class. Teacher : Very convenient. R : No, I did. My locked got stuck  Paris : Stop it! Teacher : Miss Gilmore, since you say you wrecked Miss Geller's project, then you may help her fix it. You have until tomorrow. R : Fine. Paris : No. I don't want your help! R : But I don't mind doing it. Paris : Just stay out of this. R : I'm trying to help you. Paris : Well don't! Teacher : Ladies, enough. Miss Geller, if you don't want Miss Gilmore's help you may have until tomorrow. If it's not done, you will receive an incomplete. Is that understood? Paris : Yes. Teacher : As long as you're standing, Class, we have a new student. Say hello to Rory Gilmore. Class : Hi, Rory. Tristin : Hello Mary. Miss Patty : Walk smooth. That's the new Harry Potter on your heads. If they should drop, Harry will die, and there won't be anymore books. Now that's how you should've dressed this morning, Missy. Luke : What are you doing here? L : See, now that's why you were voted Mr. Personality of the New Millennium. Where's your crown? Luke : I just mean you don't usually come it at this time. L : I have to pick up Rory from school. Thank you. Luke : You're welcome. L : No lectures? Luke : My blood sugar's low. I'll eat an apple and get back to you. L : God, this has been one hectic, bizarro day for me. Luke : Yeah? L : Yeah. This morning with the being late. And my mother with her existing. Oh, and this father. This father from Ch ilton. He drove all the way from Hartford just to ask me out. Luke : Really? Are you going? L : No. He's got a kid in school with Rory. The whole thing just seemed a little weird. Luke : Good. L : Good? Luke : Yeah, I think it's good that you turned him down. L : Okay. Luke : I mean, he's probably old, right? L : Old? Luke : I mean, he's got a kid in high school. L : Well, so do I. Luke : Yeah, but you were young when you had Rory. Most people aren't that young. Most people are..L : Old. Luke : Yeah. L : Like this guy who asked me out. Luke : But you're not going. L : No. No, I'm not going. L : Oh, that's me. Hi Babette. What? Okay. No. No, I'll be right there. Thanks. Uh, I have to go. Luke : Keep it. I gave you decaf. L : Hey. Babette : Oh, Lorelai, I'm so sorry I had to call you like this. L : That's okay, Babette. I appreciate it. Babette : All of a sudden, they pull up, get out of the truck, and start sniffing around. It's very strange. L : Let me go talk to them. Man : Tell her about the gnome. Babette : They kicked a gnome. L : What? Babette : Right in the head. Man : That's just not cool. L : I'm very sorry. Is the gnome okay?",1
Babette,"He's fine, sugar. But I wouldn't trust these boys. Gnome kicking says a lot about a man's character. L : Yes, well, I'm gonna go take care of this. Thanks. L : Hey. Um, what are you doing? Man 1 : You live here? L : Yeah. Man 1 : I'm supposed to install a DSL for a Lorelai Gilmore. Is that you? L : Yes, but.. Man 1 : I'm Mick. L : Nice to meet you. Could you get off my porch?",1
Mick,"I was told that you wouldn't be here, but to look for a ceramic frog with a key inside. We can't find the frog. L : I didn't order a DSL. Mick : The order was placed by an -- Emily Gilmore . We would've been done by now, but the frog search put us way behind. Man 2 : Hey, Mick, found it. Mick : You found the frog? Man 2 : It wasn't a frog, it was a turtle. Mick : It says here it's a frog. L : Turtle. Mick : Really? L : Trust me. I'm going to have to cancel that DSL order. Mick : You sure? It's already paid for. L : Yeah, I know. We don't need a DSL, so thanks for coming, and you guys can just go. Babette : Is there a problem? L : Oh, nothing Shakespeare couldn't turn into a really good play. Teacher : The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, withwhich they have hitherto protected themselves so that no one could reform them, whereby Christians has fallen terribly. Who said this? R : Martin Luther. Teacher : Very good, Miss Gilmore. And what year does Martin Luther address the Christian nobility? R : 1520. Teacher : Very good, Miss Gilmore. Until next time, class. Paris : Stay out of my way. I will make this school a living hell for you. Tristin : See you tomorrow, Mary. Rory : The name is Rory. Stylist : Can I help you?! L : God, I wish. Grandmother : What on earth..? L : You're not buying us a DSL. Grandmother : Lorelai, this is hardly the place. L : I canceled the order, and it's not happening. Grandmother : But Rory needs the Internet for her school. L : We have the Internet. Grandmother : This is faster. L : Well, we like our internet slow, okay? We can turn it on, walk around, dance, make a sandwich. With DSL, there's no dancing, no walking, and we'd starve. It'd be all work and no play. Have you not seen ""The Shining"", Mom? Grandmother : What on earth are you talking about? L : Also, there will be no cars, no parking spaces. And all the uniforms will be supplied by me. The mother. That's final. There will be no discussion. Grandmother : You're being stubborn, as usual.L : No, Mom, I'm not being stubborn. I'm being me! The same person who always needed to work out her own problems and take care of herself. Because that's the way I was born. That's how I am! Grandmother : Florence, I'm dripping. L : I appreciate what you have done for Rory in paying for this school, That will not be forgotten. You won't let it. But she is my daughter. And I decide how we live, not you. Now then, do they validate parking here? Grandmother : There's a stamp at the desk. L : Thank you. L : Mm. Hey, you. R : So, this whole plaid-skirt thing  My idea? L : My day sucked too. R : Promise? L : I swear on my mother's life. R : Not yet. L : Still hugging, still hugging. So, I brought us some coffee. R : Why, I'm shocked. L : Triple caps, easy foam. If that doesn't work, we'll stick our fingers in a light socket. Come here. What, do they expect you to get smart all in one day? R : Oh, they expect a lot of things. L : So tell me. R : I don't know. It was just one big, long, scary, tweedy, bad eight hours. L : Add some hair spray, and you got my day. R : One of the girls already hates me. The guys are weird. L : Weirder than other guys? R : Yeah, they kept calling me M ary. L : You're kidding me. Wow, I can't believe they still say that.R : Why? What does it mean? L : It means like, Virgin Mary. It means they think you look like a goody-goody. R : You're kidding. L : No. R : Well what would they have called me if they thought I looked like a sl*t? L : Well, they might have added a Magdalene to it. R : Wow. Biblical insults. This is an advanced school. Lane : It was so weird not having you in school today. I mean, I finally noticed some of the other kids. Let me say, they are a sad lot. R : Yeah, well add a couple plaid skirts, and you got the Chilton freaks. Lane : I totally miss you. R : I miss you. L : I have an idea. What about, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, when I go into Hartford for my business class, what if Lane comes along and you guys can shop and study, and join a cult and shave your heads. Lane : Really? L : All except the shaving your heads part. Lane : Oh, no. What time is it? R : 6:30 Lane : Oh, no. I'm late for dinner. L : Again? Lane, your mother is gonna k*ll me if I keep sending you home fat and happy. Lane : I'm sorry. But she found a web site that sells Tofu in bulk. L : Oh, you're kidding, right? Lane : Yesterday, she went out and bought a bigger fridge. L : Boy, honey, your life is scary. Lane : Can I have your crust? R : It's the least I can do. Lane : Thanks. Bye. R : Bye. L : Bye. A pizza for your thoughts. R : I wish I could figure out a way to get Paris off my back. L : Yeah, angry chicks are the worst. When I was in high school I had a Paris. R : Yeah? L : It was horrible. R : How'd you get rid of her? L : I got pregnant and dropped out. R : What if I just learn to french braid her hair. L : Even better. Sweetie, you can't let those kids get you down. Do you want me to talk to anybody? A parent, a teacher, a big guy named Moose? R : I'll just figure it out for myself. L : Okay. What? R : I was just thinking about the way Paris' face looked when I beat her to that Martin Luther question. L : Good, huh?",1
Rory,14 shades of purple. L : Cool.,1
Rory,"Tomorrow I'm sh**ting for 15. L : Hey, what do you think of Luke? R : What do you mean? L : I mean, do you think he's cute?",1

RICHARD,"Dinner was lovely, Emily.",1
EMILY,Mira does make a perfect cassoulet.,1
LORELAI,Who's Mira?,1
EMILY,Our cook.,1
LORELAI,I thought the cook was Heidi.,1
EMILY,"Oh, no, we let Heidi go months ago. She had a problem closing things -- the door, the refrigerator --",1
RICHARD,The liquor bottle.,1
EMILY,"Then it was Trina, then Sophia.",1
RICHARD,"Oh, I liked Sophia.",1
EMILY,You did not.,1
RICHARD,I didn't?,1
EMILY,She was the one who sang.,1
RICHARD,That's right -- terrible woman.,1
EMILY,And after Sophia we had Anton.,1
RICHARD,That's right. Anton was the one that I liked.,1
LORELAI,"I'm sorry, Dad, how do you mix up Anton and Sophia?",1
RICHARD,What do you mean?,1
LORELAI,"Well, one is a man and one is a woman.",1
RICHARD,And your point being?,1
LORELAI,That one is a man and one is a woman.,1
RICHARD,"I have a lot to do in a day, Lorelai, I don't have time to keep up with a multitude",1
ofPosted,10/30/00 21:22people that your mother employs.,1
LORELAI,But one is a man and one is a woman.,1
LORELAI,"The dinner was so wonderful, Mira.",1
SARAH,It's Sarah.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, I'm sorry.",1
LORELAI,Mom! Her name is Sarah!,1
EMILY,I thought she said Mira.,1
LORELAI,Ugh!,1
RORY,"Hey, Grandma, these plates are really pretty.",1
EMILY,"Thank you, Rory. They were your great-grandmother's.",1
RICHARD,Lorelai the first.,1
RORY,I thought Mom was the first.,1
EMILY,Not in the name.,1
LORELAI,"No, but in so many other things I was a regular trailblazer. Just finishing your thought, Mom.",1
RICHARD,"Lorelai the first was my mother. She was an extremely accomplished equestrian, a distinguished patron of the arts, and she was also world-famous for her masquerade balls. She was quite a woman, my mother.",1
EMILY,"Yes she was. Mira, come cut the cake please.",1
LORELAI,"Yes, and why don't you bring Sarah out here with you?",1
EMILY,"So, Lorelai, how are things at that charming little inn of yours?",1
LORELAI,Mm -- they're still charming and little. We're just crossing our fingers it doesn't assert itself and become rude and large.,1
RORY,Mom's having a huge wedding there this week.,1
EMILY,Really?,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, actually there's people coming from all over the country.",1
EMILY,"Well, isn't that nice?",1
LORELAI,Yeah.,1
EMILY,"Rory, how's Chilton?",1
LORELAI,"OK, done with me now.",1
EMILY,"I'm sorry, was there more to the story?",1
LORELAI,"Uh, Rory has to pick a team sport to play.",1
RORY,It's a requirement.,1
RICHARD,Physical fitness is as important as intellectual fitness. So says Plato and so say I.,1
EMILY,What sport are you going to pick?,1
RORY,I'm not sure. I'm not really the athletic type.,1
LORELAI,I told her she should go out for the debating team.,1
RORY,It's not a sport.,1
LORELAI,It is the way the Gilmores play.,1
EMILY,"So, what are your choices?",1
RORY,"God, there's like a thousand of",1
them,"basketball, lacrosse, swimming, track, golf --",1
EMILY,Golf?,1
RORY,Yeah.,1
EMILY,Well your grandfather is a golf player.,1
LORELAI,Oops.,1
EMILY,He plays every week at the club. He could teach you to play like a pro.,1
RICHARD,Emily.,1
EMILY,"Why, he could take you there on Sunday. It's perfect.",1
RICHARD,It's not something you can teach in an afternoon.,1
LORELAI,That's OK. Rory can pick something else.,1
EMILY,Why should she pick something else? She needs to learn a sport and Richard can teach her a sport. You can use your mother's old golf clubs. They're upstairs gathering dust along with the rest of her potential.,1
LORELAI,"OK, Mom, can I maybe talk to you for a minute?",1
EMILY,We're having dessert.,1
LORELAI,I know but I'd like to talk to you fast before the sugar sets in and makes me crazy.,1
EMILY,You are the oddest person.,1
LORELAI,Too easy.,1
EMILY,What is so important it can't wait for cake?,1
LORELAI,Keep moving.,1
EMILY,This is as far as I can go unless you'd like me to bore my way through the wall.,1
LORELAI,"Don't do this, Mom.",1
EMILY,Do what?,1
LORELAI,Force Rory and Dad to go golfing.,1
EMILY,I'm not forcing anybody.,1
LORELAI,Well you're manipulating the situation in a way that gives no one a way out. That's force. Look it up.,1
EMILY,I'm just trying to help your daughter get an education.,1
LORELAI,Thank you. She'll find another sport.,1
EMILY,Why should she?,1
LORELAI,Because she doesn't want to go and Dad doesn't want to take her.,1
EMILY,"Oh, your father doesn't know what he wants. He'd get his hair cut at the butcher if I let him.",1
LORELAI,Let it go please.,1
EMILY,"Well, isn't this interesting? You're afraid.",1
LORELAI,Of what?,1
EMILY,That Rory will enjoy the club and have a good time without you.,1
LORELAI,That's crazy.,1
EMILY,I agree.,1
LORELAI,I'm not afraid.,1
EMILY,Then let her go.,1
LORELAI,"She won't enjoy it, Mom.",1
EMILY,Well why don't you just let Rory decide?,1
LORELAI,Because Rory is the sweetest kid in the whole world and she won't tell you that she doesn't want to go becasue she's too afraid of hurting your feelings.,1
EMILY,Oh I'm sure you can give her some coaching to help her get over that.,1
LORELAI,"I'm not trying to hurt your feelings, Mom. Believe it or not, this is not about you.",1
EMILY,"Of course it's about me. If Rory goes and has a good time without you, then I win.",1
LORELAI,"OK, Bob Barker. Listen, Rory knocks herself out all week at Chilton. Weekends are the only time she has to unwind and have fun.",1
EMILY,With you?,1
LORELAI,I'm there.,1
EMILY,So let me get this straight. There's no way that Rory can possibly enjoy a weekend day with her grandfather.,1
LORELAI,"You're just going to twist it all around, aren't you?",1
EMILY,And you know your daughter so well that you don't even have to ask her opinion on this. She'd be miserable and you know it.,1
LORELAI,"I am so setting myself up here, but yes, she would be miserable.",1
EMILY,That sounds a little controlling to me.,1
LORELAI,Yeah I walked right into that.,1
EMILY,"Interesting, isn't it, you being the one who's controlling?",1
LORELAI,I am not being --,1
EMILY,According to you I was the only one in the family with that particular gift.,1
LORELAI,Mom I never said that!,1
EMILY,"I guess you and I are more alike that you thought, aren't we?",1
LORELAI,You win.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, man, did you get blindsided? I'm so sorry.",1
RORY,That's OK.,1
LORELAI,"I tried to stop it, I swear.",1
RORY,I know. Maybe it won't be that bad.,1
LORELAI,Maybe it won't.,1
RORY,Maybe I'll like it.,1
LORELAI,Maybe you will.,1
RORY,Maybe you could come w ith me.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, is there a ""you're crazy"" team? 'Cause I think they'd make you captain.",1
RORY,Please?,1
LORELAI,"Rory, I love you. I would take a b*llet for you. But I'd rather stick something sharp in my ear than go to the club with you.",1
RORY,Fine.,1
LORELAI,I'd rather slide down a banister of razor blades and land in a pool of alcohol than go to the club with you.,1
RORY,I got it.,1
LORELAI,"Don't stop me, I'm on a roll. I'd rather eat my own hand than go to the club with you. Ooh, I'd rather get my face surgically altered to look like that lunatic rich lady with the lion head than go to the club with you.",1
RORY,Would you like me to drive so you can continue your diatribe?,1
LORELAI,Would ya? Thanks. I'd rather cut off my head and use it as a punch bowl than go to the club with you.,1
LORELAI,You'll walk down here over the bridge with the swans floating by and the music playing --,1
JACKIE,What are they doing with those purple flowers?,1
LORELAI,Just decorating the bridge.,1
JACKIE,I didn't want purple flowers. I wanted pink.,1
JESSICA,And I wanted blue.,1
LORELAI,So I thought violet would be a nice compromise.,1
JACKIE,But we paid for pink flowers.,1
JESSICA,,1
SHALES,,1
SHALES,Their father spoiled them.,1
LORELAI,,1
SHALES,,1
SHALES,"Now, disaster list. What if it rains?",1
LORELAI,,1
SHALES,What if it's too windy?,1
LOREAI,,1
SHALES,Too hot?,1
LORELAI,,1
SHALES,So I have nothing to worry about.,1
LORELAI,,1
SHALES,Well there must be something.,1
LORELAI,,1
SHALES,How remarkable?,1
LORELAI,,1
SHALES,This is my favorite place in the whole world.,1
LORELAI,"Could you send Maury up to room twelve in about twenty minutes? Thanks. So, any problems?",1
MICHELorelai,With the wedding or my life?,1
LORELAI,One guess -- and I'll give you a,1
hint,it's not your life.,1
MICHELorelai,Do you stage these events to t*rture me?,1
LORELAI,Yes.,1
MICHELorelai,Job well done.,1
LORELAI,"OK, let's start again. Any problems?",1
MICHELorelai,"Guests are checked in, baskets are given out, and 200,000 tons of Jordan almonds have been delivered.",1
LORELAI,"OK, good. Did Rory call?",1
MICHELorelai,No.,1
LORELAI,"Hmm. She's golfing all day with my father and I'm half expecting this big ""save me"" call to come in -- you don't care at all do you?",1
MICHELorelai,To me you are the teacher in the Charlie Brown cartoon.,1
LORELAI,"OK, forget it. So, have the grooms arrived? Their plane was supposed to get in a 7 so I'msurprised they're not here by now.",1
MICHELorelai,Well maybe they made a run for it.,1
LORELAI,"Ooh, somebody got stood up at the prom.",1
MICHELorelai,Oh. Dear.,1
LORELAI,What?,1
MICHELorelai,Are those -- ?,1
LORELAI,No. It would be too --,1
LORELAI,-- weird.,1
MICHELorelai,You kept this from me o n purpose.,1
LORELAI,It's like a really snooty Doublemint commercial.,1
MICHELorelai,Just let me know when the midgets and clowns arrive.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, no, no, no. You have to get them all settled in.",1
MICHELorelai,I'm not talking to them.,1
LORELAI,Yes you are.,1
MICHELorelai,Well I'm not talking to them nicely.,1
RICHARD,It's after 8:00. She should be here already.,1
EMILY,She'll be here.,1
RICHARD,You're supposed to tee off at your designated time.,1
EMILY,You pay good money to that place. You'll tee off when you tee off. Is that what you're wearing?,1
RICHARD,Yes.,1
EMILY,Hmm.,1
RICHARD,What's wrong with what I'm wearing?,1
EMILY,Nothing. It's fine.,1
RICHARD,This whole thing is absurd.,1
EMILY,She's your granddaughter.,1
RICHARD,She's a sixteen year old who would rather be at the mall.,1
EMILY,"Make sure you show her all around the club, especially the rose garden.",1
RICHARD,I am not a guide.,1
EMILY,And make sure you take her to lunch and have her get dessert.,1
RICHARD,No one said anything about lunch.,1
EMILY,I hope Lorelai's clubs are still in good shape.,1
RICHARD,"Emily you are not listening to me. I will teach her to play golf, as promised by you, but lunch is out of the question.",1
EMILY,You have to eat.,1
RICHARD,"Yes, but --",1
EMILY,So you'll eat together. Do you ahve sunscreen?,1
RICHARD,Emily.,1
EMILY,She's here.,1
RICHARD,"Ah, 8:30. We must rememb er to buy her a watch.",1
EMILY,"Richard, so help me G od, you will be sweet to this girl and make this a memorable day for her. This is the first time w e've gotten to show our granddaughter off at the club and it means a great deal to my happiness -- and yours -- that this day go well. Are we clear?",1
EMILY,"Rory, hello.",1
RORY,Sorry I'm late.,1
EMILY,Nonsense. You're right on time.,1
RORY,"Hi, Grandpa.",1
RICHARD,"Rory, nice to see you.",1
EMILY,"This is a perfect day for golfing, isn't it Richard?",1
RICHARD,It was cooler at 8.,1
RORY,Am I dressed OK? I didn't have any of those short pant things.,1
EMILY,"Well, actually there is something missing. Oh, wait a minute... EMILY Here you go. Now you look just like Tiger Woods.",1
RORY,"Wow, that's some hat. EMILY OK, off you go, you two. Have a wonderful time.",1
RORY,We will.,1
RICHARD,You bet.,1
RORY,Is it hard to become a memb er here?,1
RICHARD,Everyone has to go through a thorough screening process.,1
RORY,Kind of like the FBI?,1
RICHARD,We're much more thorough than that.,1
RORY,Wow.,1
RICHARD,Yes. Did you know the merger of Forscape and D.S.S.,1
RORY,Really.,1
RICHARD,International finance will never be the same and all because of a lost golfing bet.,1
RORY,That's crazy.,1
RICHARD,"Well that's high finance. Well, here we are. Now, what do you know about golf?",1
RORY,That it's a good walk spoiled?,1
RICHARD,"Well, your driver is the most powerful club in your bag, and as such, it can be your most valuable asset or your greatest liability. To wield it properly requires a precise combination of confidence and humility.",1
RORY,Confidence and humility. Got it.,1
RICHARD,"There you are. That's a pretty good natural grip. Now, line the toe of your left foot up with the ball. That's right. Now, drop this shoulder a little bit. Now, keeping your left arm firm, draw the club back, swing it cleanly through the ball.",1
RORY,I'm betting that was wrong.,1
RICHARD,There are no rights and wrongs to the learning process. Try that again.,1
RORY,I'm betting that was wrong.,1
SOOKIE,These are blueberries. I think ordered strawberries.,1
JACKSON,I know but --,1
SOOKIE,"Yeah, no, I did. I wrote it down. I got a copy. Yeah, mushrooms, melon, endive, peaches, kiwi.",1
JACKSON,"Excuse me, crazy lady --",1
SOOKIE,Oh I should make some kiwi ice cream. That would be good sometime.,1
JACKSON,Sookie!,1
SOOKIE,What?,1
JACKSON,"Listen. I know you ordered strawberries but they weren't any good so instead of selling you sub-standard strawberries, I brought blueberries.",1
SOOKIE,I've got to make strawberry shortcake for 200 people. I think I'm gonna need strawberries.,1
JACKSON,Use the blueberries.,1
SOOKIE,To make what?,1
JACKSON,Blueberry shortcake.,1
SOOKIE,There's no such thing.,1
JACKSON,"Hey, the world was flat until someone took a boat trip.",1
SOOKIE,Can I see these strawberries?,1
JACKSON,No.,1
SOOKIE,Just one?,1
JACKSON,No.,1
SOOKIE,How about a Polaroid?,1
JACKSON,No.,1
LORELAI,"Coffee, coffee, coffee. Ooh, Sookie, can I take some of this cake home to Rory? She's going to need a special treat tonight. She's spending the entire day with my father golfing at the club.",1
SOOKIE,No.,1
JACKSON,Take the blueberries!,1
SOOKIE,No.,1
JACKSON,Ugh.,1
LORELAI,"Golfing was masterminded by my mother, of course. One minute we're having an excrutiating family dinner and the next she's manipulating my kid into spending her Sunday with my father at the country club. Oh, I can't talk about it anymore. It's making me too upset. Tell me something happy.",1
SOOKIE,I can't make the strawberry shortcake.,1
LORELAI,Wow. You suck at this game.,1
MICHELorelai,"The battle for soup versus salad is waging in the other room. Come quick and settle it, please, as I'm running out of French curse words that they won't understand.",1
JESSICA,Soup --,1
JACKIE,,1
SHALES,It's been 45 minutes of soup or salad. Soup or salad -- I can't do it anymore. Get me a cab. I'm going to go far away now and never come back.,1
LORELAI,,1
SHALES,That -- that will work.,1
LORELAI,Choice of soup or salad.,1
SOOKIE,Got it.,1
LORELAI,It's so weird.,1
SOOKIE,Which one is which?,1
LORELAI,I don't know. I think the one on the right is Matt.,1
MICHELorelai,"No, the one on the left is Matt. The one on the right is Mark.",1
LORELAI,That's very impressive.,1
MICHELorelai,"Yes, well, I'm very good at observing people, you know, learning the tics and traits, sound of their voices. It's a gift.",1
SOOKIE,That one has a Post-It on its back.,1
MICHELorelai,"Oh, well, then that's Mark. The one on the right is Matt.",1
LORELAI,You will go and take that off of him.,1
MICHE,I will not. We can't all just call everyone 'sweetie' and get away with it.,1
SOOKIE,"Now, go with me, here. Let's say Mark walks into a hotel room and he sees his wife naked, but it's not his wife, it's his naked sister-in-law, and he has sex with her. Would that be cheating?",1
MICHELorelai,My head hurts.,1
LORELAI,I think no.,1
SOOKIE,Really? Lucky.,1
MICHELorelai,If you ask me this union belongs on a public access station. It's against the laws of nature and just this short of completely obscene.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, you won't be giving the wedding toast.",1
LORELAI,,1
SHALES,Do you have children?,1
LORELAI,,1
SHALES,Do you hate her?,1
LORELAI,,1
SHALES,Not ever?,1
LORELAI,,1
SHALES,That was the high point for me.,1
RORY,I can't believe I hit the ball!,1
RICHARD,Well it was quite impressive.,1
RORY,It landed in the water.,1
RICHARD,"Yes, but the splash was quite impressive.",1
RORY,This place is so beautiful. I could see just coming here to think or read. But that probably defeats the purpose of the holes with the flag thing.,1
RICHARD,There is something rather serene about walking around here.,1
RORY,Do you come here every week?,1
RICHARD,No. When I can. I'm often working on the weekends.,1
RORY,Bummer .,1
RICHARD,Isn't it.,1
MAN,Hi Richard.,1
RICHARD,Hello.,1
RORY,Can I ask you a question?,1
RICHARD,Go ahead.,1
RORY,What do you do?,1
RICHARD,I'm the executive vice-president of the Gehrman-Driscoll Insurance Corporation.,1
RORY,Wow.,1
RICHARD,Yes.,1
RORY,"And as executive vice-president, what do you do?",1
RICHARD,"Well, it's a very big company -- one of the largest in the United States as a matter of fact -- I have a myriad of duties which would bore you greatly to hear about.",1
RORY,"Oh, OK.",1
RICHARD,I oversee our international division.,1
RORY,That sounds important.,1
RICHARD,"Well, it rates a parking spot.",1
RORY,Do you get to travel a lot?,1
RICHARD,Quite a bit.,1
RORY,Lucky.,1
RICHARD,I suspect you have a yen for travelling.,1
RORY,I'm up to my ears in yens.,1
RICHARD,Any particular place you'd like to go?,1
RORY,"Hundreds of places. Paris, Rome, London, Prague, Istanbul, Fez -- Have you ever been to Fez?",1
RICHARD,I can't say that I have.,1
RORY,I want to go to Fez.,1
RICHARD,I think travelling for a young girl is a very important thing. Your mother never got a chance to travel much.,1
RORY,I know. She talks about that all the time.,1
RICHARD,She does?,1
RORY,"We've got a deal. When I graduate from high school we're going to go backpacking through Europe together. You know, do the whole hostel thing. I just hope it really happens.",1
RICHARD,Well we'll just have to make sure that it does.,1
GLORIA,Richard!,1
RICHARD,Gloria! You look wonderful.,1
GLORIA,Aren't you sweet? Is Emily here?,1
RICHARD,"No, I'm taking my granddaughter for a round of golf.",1
GLORIA,"Well, we must get together.",1
RICHARD,Absolutely.,1
RICHARD,The most odious woman alive.,1
RICHARD,"Now, we'll meet back here in forty minutes?",1
RORY,OK.,1
RICHARD,"And then, if you like, we can get some lunch.",1
RORY,That would be great.,1
RICHARD,Fine.,1
RORY,Cool.,1
RICHARD,"Yes. MAN #1: And I'm telling him I've been coming here for twenty years my young friend, and for twenty years that cart, number 43, has been my golf cart. MAN #2: He should have known that. MAN #1: Everybody knows that. MAN #3: Did he give you the cart? MAN #1: Damn right he gave me the cart. MAN #2: You should have never had to ask because he should have known that.",1
RICHARD,"Hello, gentlemen. MAN #1: Richard, good to see you.",1
RICHARD,"Heard about your golf cart. Too bad. MAN #1: Yeah, well, I'm still angry about it.",1
RICHARD,"Well, yes. MAN #3: Richard, who was that young lady I saw you on the golf course with?",1
RICHARD,That is my granddaughter. MAN #2: Really? She's lovely.,1
MAN,#1: Lorelai's girl.,1
RICHARD,Mmm-hmm. MAN #3: You're lucky. My granddaughter looks like she just fell off a potato truck. MAN #2: My granddaughter would never be caught here. Might get in the way of the time spent at the tattoo parlor or getting something pierced or doing whatever she does while she runs wild through the streets like a rabid dog. MAN #1: Cut her off! That would get her attention! MAN #3: I can help you with the litigation.,1
RICHARD,"Actually, Rory just started Chilton. MAN #2: Really? MAN #1: Damn fine school.",1
RICHARD,"Said she wanted to learn golf. I think she's taken to it quite well. MAN #1: Yeah, well, just as long as isn't taken with a certain golf cart. MAN #2: I'm writing a letter to the board. MAN #1: I wish you would. If they would take -- WOMAN #1: And you know she took the house. WOMAN #2: She deserved it -- putting up with that tramp all those years. WOMAN #1: Last year, Christmas, he bough them both the same bracelet. WOMAN #2: She should have just shot him like his first wife did. WOMAN #1: Oh I love Janie. Is she out yet?",1
GLORIA,"Nanette, Peg. WOMAN #1: Gloria, hi. Good game?",1
GLORIA,"Not bad, you? WOMAN #1: Oh, I just came for the steam. We must get together and play sometime soon.",1
GLORIA,Next week? WOMAN #1: I'll call you. WOMAN #1: The most odious woman alive.,1
LORELAI,"OK, I need more tulle here. I need the feeling of a major tutu, OK? Oh, uh, hey, Gary, Gary! The ribbons go on the chairs, OK, not on the trees. Oh, great!",1
LORELAI,Hey! SWAN,1
GUY,Where do you want the swans?,1
LORELAI,Well do you know where the pond is? SWAN,1
GUY,Nope.,1
LORELAI,You know that little road you came up? SWAN,1
GUY,Nope.,1
LORELAI,OK. Do you know how to say 'big help' in Chinese? SWAN,1
GUY,Nope.,1
LORELAI,Michel! This is twenty swans? SWAN,1
GUY,Sure. Why not?,1
MICHELorelai,You screeched?,1
LORELAI,Yeah. I need you to show this guy where to put the swans.,1
MICHELorelai,Absolutely not.,1
LORELAI,"Well I can't leave, OK? I've got a major tulle festival going on out here.",1
MICHELorelai,I will never go near those filthy birds.,1
LORELAI,Why?,1
MICHELorelai,I hate the swans.,1
LORELAI,These particular swans?,1
MICHELorelai,"No, all swans. I was att*cked by a band of swans in the Luxembourg Gardens when I was a boy. No one forgets that.",1
LORELAI,"Oh no -- not being att*cked by a band of swans. Was it an all-boy band? Kind of a scary, feathery 'N Sync kind of fiasco?",1
MICHELorelai,This is not funny.,1
LORELAI,"No, I'm sorry, it's not. It's not funny at all.",1
LORELAI,"Oh my God! Come on, you have to admit, that's a little funny.",1
DRELLA,"Hey, Pepe le Pew, you wanna give me a hand with this?",1
MICHELorelai,No.,1
LORELAI,"Listen, it's Drella or the swans.",1
MICHELorelai,So either one beast of terror or another?,1
DRELLA,What the hell is he babbling about?,1
MICHELorelai,Don't --,1
LORELAI,He's afraid of the swans.,1
MICHELorelai,Thank you.,1
DRELLA,Of course he is. He's French.,1
LORELAI,Mmm.,1
MICHELorelai,"OK, I'll take you to the pond.",1
LORELAI,Thank you.,1
MICHELorelai,But stay far away from me.,1
DRELLA,Can't stand the talk -- love to watch the walk.,1
RORY,"She caught him in the pool house with the tennis pro, not the riding instructor.",1
RICHARD,I had no idea.,1
RORY,That commit tee of yours is not looking at people as much as you think.,1
RICHARD,Why would they? From what you've told me they're all involved in one nefarious activity after another.,1
RORY,It's a conspiracy.,1
RICHARD,It's Peyton Place. Is there more?,1
RORY,Can you handle it?,1
RICHARD,I'll steel myself.,1
RORY,"OK, Mr. Neville likes all things frilly.",1
RICHARD,Good God. He's my broker.,1
RORY,I don't think one will affect the other. MAN #1: Mind if we barge in?,1
RICHARD,"Look who's here. Ah, Rory, this is Julian Johnson and Edward James",1
EDWARD,"Call me ""Ed"".",1
JULIAN,"You can call me ""Ed"" too.",1
RORY,It's nice to meet you.,1
RICHARD,Would you like to join us?,1
EDWARD,If Rory doesn't mind us intruding on her time with her grandfather.,1
RORY,"No, that's fine.",1
JULIAN,"Oh that's good. So, we hear you're attending Chilton.",1
RORY,I just started.,1
JULIAN,That's a hard school.,1
RORY,Yes sir.,1
RICHARD,Rory is an excellent student.,1
JULIAN,Really?,1
RICHARD,4.0 grade point average.,1
JULIAN,Whoa! That's got me beat.,1
RICHARD,She's going to Fez someday.,1
JULIAN,Fez? What the hell is in Fez?,1
RICHARD,That's for her to find out.,1
LUKE,Interesting hat.,1
RORY,I went golfing with my grandfather today.,1
LUKE,Did you know that golf courses are an environmental blight because of the chemicals they use to keep the grass green?,1
RORY,"Actually I did. Bad joke, sorry.",1
LORELAI,"My God -- this day. The swans, the tulle, my head...Luke, I need the largest cheeseburger in the world. Let's break a record here, mister. So, the wedding is a nightmare. We got these ten boxes of creepy larvae that are supposed to swarm into beautiful butterflies on the wedding day. They swarmed a little early! What's with the hat?",1
RORY,Grandma gave it to me.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, now, that's just mean.",1
RORY,It's not that bad.,1
LORELAI,Do you want a mirror?,1
LORELAI,"So, Rory's golfing adventure. Tell me!",1
RORY,It was fine.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, honey, I brought you some of Sookie's chocolate cake to make you feel better.",1
RORY,It really wasnt't that bad.,1
LORELAI,"You are the sweetest kid in the whole world. Where on earth did you get that from? Luke, am I mistaken or did that sign on the door say ""open""? So, where were we?",1
RORY,Me golfing.,1
LORELAI,Right -- go.,1
RORY,"OK, well, uh, by the end of the day I could even hit the ball. Sometimes it wasn't my ball but the intentions were good.",1
LORELAI,"Well good intentions and no physical exertion whatsoever is what the game of golf was built on. So, um, did you order?",1
RORY,I'm not hungry. I had a big lunch at the club.,1
LUKE,With all the other devastators of our land.,1
LORELAI,You had a big lunch at the club?,1
RORY,"Yes, it was quite good.",1
LORELAI,Quite? What's with the quite?,1
RORY,What do you mean?,1
LORELAI,You don't ever say quite.,1
RORY,I've said quite plenty of times.,1
LORELAI,"Whatever. So besides the ""quite good"" lunch you had, what else happened?",1
RORY,"Nothing. We played, I met his friends, I took a steam.",1
LORELAI,You took a steam?,1
RORY,Yeah. I sweated out all my toxins and I stole a towel.,1
LORELAI,Wow! Sounds like you really had a good time.,1
RORY,I did.,1
LORELAI,Really?,1
RORY,Really.,1
LORELAI,Really?,1
RORY,Really.,1
LORELAI,Really.,1
RORY,"OK, new word now.",1
LORELAI,Sorry -- I just -- I'm surprised. I thought you were gonna be bored.,1
RORY,I was kind of surprised too. I don't know -- it was pretty there and Grandpa and I talked a lot.,1
LORELAI,You talked? Really?,1
RORY,You're doing it again.,1
LORELAI,Sorry. You talked?,1
RORY,We talked about Fez.,1
LORELAI,And he thought it was a hat.,1
RORY,I told him about our backpacking trip. He thought it was a great idea.,1
LORELAI,Wow. So you really had fun.,1
RORY,Yeah.,1
LORELAI,That's great.,1
LORELAI,"That is really, really great.",1
LUKE,I thought you were starving.,1
LORELAI,Things change. Move on.,1
RORY,Does this hat really look bad on me?,1
LORELAI,,1
PATTY,,1
PATTY,"You know, in some countries if you dance this close you're cheating on your wife. MATT : You're next. MARK : Take your time.",1
LORELAI,"Hey. Oh my God, you have good handwriting.",1
RORY,Thank you.,1
LORELAI,You did not get that from me. You got your fabulous flair from me.,1
RORY,I also got my deviated septum from you.,1
LORELAI,"Hey, focus on the flair.",1
MICHELorelai,"It's for you. He says he's your father although why he'd volunteer that freely, I do not know.",1
LORELAI,My father?,1
MICHELorelai,Yes.,1
LORELAI,Are you sure?,1
MICHELorelai,Please just take the phone.,1
LORELAI,"Dad? Yeah it's Lorelai -- who else calls you ""Dad""? Yeah she's right here. Hold on. It's for you.",1
RORY,Thanks. Hello? Hey Grandpa...,1
RORY,,1
SHALES,"Jackie wants Samuel Barber, John Cage, and Philip Glass and Jessica wants Shania Twain's ""I Feel Like a Woman.""",1
DRELLA,,1
SHALES,Oh please.,1
DRELLA,,1
SHALES,I'll give you an extra $100.,1
DRELLA,You just got yourself a jukebox.,1
RORY,"Yeah, yeah, I'd love to see it. No, if you want to. Sure. That sounds good. Yeah.",1
LORELAI,Should I leave you two alone?,1
RORY,I think I want to change my hair.,1
LORELAI,Really? I think it looks quite good.,1
RORY,You're funny. Do you want something to drink?,1
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, water.",1
LORELAI,So you talk to Grandpa today?,1
RORY,What?,1
LORELAI,Grandpa -- he called?,1
RORY,Yep.,1
LORELAI,Anything wrong?,1
RORY,No. He just found this book we were talking about.,1
LORELAI,Oh. And he just called to tell you?,1
RORY,"Yeah, why?",1
LORELAI,"Nothing. It's just weird. He doesn't call the inn that much. Or ever, actually.",1
RORY,"Well he knew that I was looking for it, so --",1
LORELAI,"Oh, sure. What book was it?",1
RORY,"Mencken's ""Chrestomathy""",1
LORELAI,"Oh, that one.",1
RORY,Yeah.,1
BABETTE,Hey! Cinnamon is stuck under the front porch again. Can I borrow some vegetable oil and a shoehorn?,1
RORY,I'll get it.,1
BABETTE,I'm callin' him and I'm callin' him and I go around the porch and this big orange tush is just starin' me in the face.,1
LORELAI,I hate when that happens.,1
BABETTE,Yeah. He must've been meowin' for an hour but Morey was playing some Thelonious on the Steinway and when Morey plays I go into this trance where all I can see is blue and moon and stars --,1
MOREY,He's out Babs!,1
BABETTE,"Oh! Never mind, Sugar. Play me home, baby!",1
LORELAI,Bye.,1
BABETTE,Oh God! It's k*lling me!,1
RORY,Babette didn't take her oil.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, keep it. Christmas is early this year. So you know what I was thinking?",1
RORY,That Madonna and Sean Penn should get remarried?,1
LORELAI,Besides that. I was thinking that your golfing expedition should totally count as a dinner.,1
RORY,What do you mean?,1
LORELAI,I mean I think I can get us out of dinner at the grandparents' on Friday. Maybe we could grab a movie.,1
RORY,"Oh, well, that's OK.",1
LORELAI,"It's no big deal, really.",1
RORY,No. It's just gonna get Grandma all freaked out.,1
LORELAI,Yeah but I can handle those freakouts. I've done that.,1
RORY,"You know, I have to get the book from Grandpa anyway. Let's just go.",1
LORELAI,Oh. All right. If you really want to.,1
RORY,I do.,1
LORELAI,"OK, fine. Is that my sweater?",1
RORY,What?,1
LORELAI,You're wearing my sweater.,1
RORY,So?,1
LORELAI,"No, it's OK. It's just I thought I asked you to at least ask, you know, before you borrow my stuff.",1
RORY,I'm sorry.,1
LORELAI,"It's OK. It's just not too much for a simple ""Can I borrow it, Mom?"" is it?",1
RORY,"No, it's not. Jeez, lighten up.",1
LORELAI,It's my favorite sweater too.,1
RORY,Since when?,1
LORELAI,Since always.,1
RORY,This is not your favorite sweater.,1
LORELAI,Yes it is and now it's going to be all stretched out just like everything else you borrow.,1
RORY,What are you talking about?,1
LORELAI,I'm talking about that you take my sweaters and you wear them and you stretch them out.,1
RORY,I couldn't possibly stretch them out! Your boobs are way bigger than mine.,1
LORELAI,That is not true.,1
RORY,Yes it is.,1
LORELAI,Your boobs are totally bigger than mine!,1
RORY,You're crazy!,1
LORELAI,Do you want to measure?,1
RORY,What?,1
LORELAI,I'm serious. Why don't you get the measuring tape right now?,1
RORY,I am not going to measure my boobs.,1
LORELAI,Because you know that you are totally bigger.,1
RORY,I'm going inside.,1
LORELAI,"Fine, don't measure. We'll just compare bras.",1
RORY,Stop it!,1
LORELAI,I'll stop when you quit stealing my stuff.,1
RORY,You're cracked!,1
LORELAI,You're...bigger.,1
LORELAI,"""Your boobs are bigger than mine""? I'm a mental case.",1
SOOKIE,So apologize.,1
LORELAI,I was too mad and stupid to apologize last night and she was gone before I got up this morning. What is wrong with me?,1
SOOKIE,You're very possessive of your sweaters.,1
LORELAI,Sookie.,1
SOOKIE,"No, I understand. I'm the same way. If somebody breathes too hard on my paring knife I'm like a crazy spider monkey.",1
LORELAI,"It's not about the sweater. It's about the golfing thing and the liking it thing. She had fun, Sookie. Just like my mother said she would.",1
SOOKIE,"Yeah, that's got to hurt.",1
LORELAI,"She should have fun. I mean, I want her to have a good relationship with her grandparents. Just because I don't doesn't mean she shouldn't, right?",1
SOOKIE,Right.,1
LORELAI,"Right. So then why was I trying to get her out of Friday night dinner? I mean, what am I trying to do -- undermine their relationship?",1
SOOKIE,No you weren't.,1
LORELAI,Yes I was.,1
SOOKIE,Yes you were.,1
LORELAI,Yes! I'm four years old!,1
SOOKIE,You're jealous.,1
LORELAI,Oh I'm not jealous.,1
SOOKIE,"Yeah, you are. You're jealous 'cause they like Rory better than you.",1
LORELAI,Oh thank you for the hug.,1
SOOKIE,"See, I'm bad at advice talks. Could we talk about soup? 'Cause I'm good with soup.",1
LORELAI,"Oh I'm sorry. You're fine. I'm all mixed up. I left that life, you know, the club, my parents. I ran from it as soon as I could. It just -- it never occurred to me that she might want it. It occurred to my mother though. God, I hate that she was right.",1
SOOKIE,You don't know that she -- ooh! Oh my God! BIKE,1
GUY,"Hey, watch it!",1
LORELAI,Oh! Aah! Are you OK? OK.,1
SOOKIE,Look at you! You're beautiful!,1
LORELAI,"I have to be more adult about this. I mean, if the country club life is what she wants, more power to her, right? You know, little white gloves and coming-out parties. That makes some girls happy, right?",1
SOOKIE,"Sure, yeah. If they're on Prozac, absolutely.",1
LORELAI,"I just never thought that I'd raise that kind of kid, you know? I mean, not that there's anything wrong with that kind of kid. I just never thought that was Rory. Maybe it's not. I don't know. Am I obsessing? Sookie? Hello? Do I have to put on my strawberry costume to get your full attention?",1
SOOKIE,"No, I'm sorry. You have a strawberry costume?",1
JACKSON,Unbelievable!,1
SOOKIE,Jackson!,1
JACKSON,So this is what we've come to? You sneaking around behind my back buying somebody else's strawberries?,1
SOOKIE,I was desperate!,1
JACKSON,You disgust me!,1
SOOKIE,I needed the strawberries!,1
JACKSON,Well now you have 'em. I hope you're happy together.,1
SOOKIE,Jackson -- wait!,1
JACKSON,No!,1

LORELAI,"No, I'm trying to hydrate you.",1
RORY,"I'm fine, thanks.",1
LORELAI,I'm sorry.,1
RORY,It's OK.,1
LORELAI,A crazy evil spirit obsessed with bra size took over my body.,1
RORY,It happens.,1
LORELAI,She's gone now.,1
RORY,Good to know.,1
LORELAI,"You know, I'm glad you're bonding with your grandparents.",1
RORY,No you're not.,1
LORELAI,Yes I am. It's just weird for me is all. I just can't relate to it.,1
RORY,You could if you tried.,1
LORELAI,"No, we're too -- too much has happened and I'm glad you are anyway.",1
RORY,OK.,1
LORELAI,"I didn't mean to cut you off from them so completely, you know. It just happened. Not having them in my life just felt so right. I just never thought -- I'm sorry. IRATE",1
MOTHERory,I did not pay $500 for this dress so you could run around and mess it up. Now you sit and be still. Cross your legs. You're a lady.,1
LORELAI,"God, I must have had a million dresses like that when I was a kid.",1
RORY,"It doesn't really scream ""you.""",1
LORELAI,No. I did all the screaming.,1
RORY,Thank you for not putting me in a dress like that.,1
LORELAI,You're welcome. Of course wearing those dresses -- not all bad.,1
RORY,No?,1
LORELAI,Oh no. They really fly up when you twirl around.,1
RORY,Huh.,1
LORELAI,And if you're wearing that ruffled underwear -- big crowd pleaser.,1
RORY,"If it makes you feel better, I think I got a fungus from the steam room.",1
LORELAI,It does. Thank you.,1
EMILY,"Oh, good, you're here.",1

EMILY,I've never heard of blueberry shortcake.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, it's a Stars Hollow specialty.",1
EMILY,Why is it already cut?,1
LORELAI,It's left over. From the wedding. At the inn.,1
EMILY,"Yes, I know where the wedding was.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, sorry. You were just doing that staring thing.",1
EMILY,You brought us used dessert?,1

EMILY,How nice. I'll just put it in the kitchen next to my half-empty box of Cheer.,1
LORELAI,She's in a good mood tonight.,1
EMILY,Can I get you a drink?,1
LORELAI,"Uh, white wine would be nice.",1
RORY,Coke.,1
EMILY,"So, Lorelai, did Rory tell you all about the wonderful time she had at the club?",1
LORELAI,,1
EMILY,Your father was simply flying all week. She really charmed him.,1
LORELAI,"Ah, well, if anybody could, it would be her.",1
EMILY,"I mean, in this age of MTV and 100 television channels who would've imagined that a young girl coul still get a thrill spending a simple afternoon with her grandfather?",1
LORELAI,"That wine would be real good right now, Mom.",1
EMILY,"I think we should consider getting her a membership at the club, don't you?",1
LORELAI,"If she wants, sure.",1
EMILY,"I mean, to have a place to go where she can socialize, that's very important to a young girl.",1
LORELAI,"Well, now especially that the crack den is closed down on the corner all her really good friends are gone. What do you think, Mom, should I pursue the career in comedy?",1
EMILY,"It's just very interesting the way things turn out, isn't it?",1
RICHARD,"Oh, you're here. Lorelai.",1
LORELAI,Dad.,1

SOOKIE,"No it's not fine. Fine is a word you use when someone stops you on the street that you sortof know but you don't wanna talk to, so they ask you how you are and you say fine and that's just enough so they don't have to keep talking because they don't want to. And then they can feel good about themselves because they've been considerate enough to ask and then if God forbid something actually is wrong they'll actually sit down and take the time to listen, even though they don't want to.",1

MAX,"You know, I think this would be a good time for a break. There's coffee in the back.",1
MAX,What were you gonna do - hit her?,1
LORELAI,"No, I just - I had some good verbal comebacks ready.",1
LORELAI,It - it just keeps getting worse.,1
MAX,Well you know not drinking it is always an option.,1
LORELAI,Not in my world.,1
MAX,I'm Max Medina.,1
LORELAI,Nice to meet you.,1
MAX,I apologize for the behaviors of some of our guests tonight. It's a tense time for some people.,1
LORELAI,The SAT season?,1
MAX,The waking hours.,1
LORELAI,"Hey, are you this nice to my kid?",1
MAX,"Yeah, it's easy. Rory's a sweet girl.",1
LORELAI,"Yeah she is, she is.",1
MAX,How is she liking Chilton?,1
LORELAI,"Oh, she loves it.",1
MAX,Really?,1
LORELAI,"Oh yeah. I mean it's an adjustment of course, but she's always wanted to go to Harvard and this is how she'll get there.",1
MAX,Harvard?,1
LORELAI,"Yeah. Ever since she could crawl, I've really wanted her to go there.",1
MAX,It's a great school.,1
LORELAI,"I actually bought her a Harvard sweatshirt when she was 4, which of course was way too big for her, so she used it as a blanket for a while and then as a make shift diaper on this really ill- fated shopping trip and now I've told you a story that would so mortify her, she'll k*ll me when she finds out you know.",1
MAX,Don't tell her then. It'll be our secret.,1
LORELAI,Well I appreciate that.,1
MAX,So are you a B-52's girl?,1
LORELAI,"What? No, I'm a klutz girl who should not drive with a coffee in her hand. I, uh, had it in the car.",1
MAX,You know I hope Rory adjust to this place. We need her here.,1
LORELAI,Thank you. That's so nice.,1
MAX,And I hope she's not too disappointed about her paper. Because it's very hard to catch up on all that reading material. I know a  D' seems pretty dismal -,1
LORELAI,Rory got a  D'?,1
MAX,"Yeah, but -",1
LORELAI,She's never gotten a  D'.,1
MAX,"It's the first paper she's had to turn in, she's bound to falter a little.",1
LORELAI,"Oh man, this totally explains the  no ice cream' thing. God I'm such and idiot!",1
MAX,The ice cream thing?,1
LORELAI,"Look, I-I've gotta go.",1
MAX,Well I'm sorry if I've said something to offend you.,1
LORELAI,"Oh no-no-no-no. It's just that if Rory got a  D', she's not feeling too good right now and I'd really like to be there.",1
MAX,I understand.,1
LORELAI,"So, it was nice meet ing you.",1
MAX,You too.,1
LORELAI,"Um, keep up the good work.",1
MAX,I will.,1
LORELAI,Don't ever make coffee ever again.,1
MAX,I won't I promise. Oh -,1
LORELAI,"Oh, ha ha ha. Thanks. Bye.",1
MAX,,1
LUKE,Here.,1
RORY,What's that?,1
LUKE,You look like you need pie.,1
RORY,I do?,1
LUKE,Violent pencil tossing usually signals the need for pie.,1
RORY,What if I'd thrown a pen?,1
LUKE,I would've brought you a trout.,1
RORY,What?,1
LUKE,"I don't make the rules, I just carry them out.",1
LORELAI,"Hey, Backwards baseball hat - new look for you. She's eating pie? Did she even have dinner?",1
LUKE,"You raised her, I just serve.",1
LORELAI,"Oh hello, bookworm.",1
RORY,"Finally, where were you?",1
LORELAI,"Well, um, actually I was in Hartford.",1
RORY,Why?,1
LORELAI,I was there for the...,1
RORY,"Parent/teacher meet ing. Oh, my God. I forgot.",1
LORELAI,It went very well. I was extremely charming. I won the whole crowd over. They made me queen.,1
RORY,So I guess you talked to Mr. Medina.,1
LORELAI,Mm-hm. Why did you let me w hine about ice cream and shoe sales when you had something major going on?,1
RORY,I know.,1
LORELAI,"I hate when I'm an idiot and I don't even know it. I like to be aware of my idiocy - to really revel in it, take pictures. I feel we missed a prime Christmas card opportunity.",1
RORY,I'm sorry.,1
LORELAI,You should've told me.,1
RORY,I couldn't.,1
LORELAI,You couldn't tell me? You tell me everything.,1
RORY,It was too humiliating.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, honey, you once told me that you loved  Saved by the Bell'. What could be more humiliating than that.?",1
RORY,"I couldn't form the words. I couldn't even say it. I couldn't even comprehend it. It was a  D'. I got a  D', I've never gotten a  D' - ever.",1
LORELAI,I know.,1
RORY,"Even when I broke my arm and couldn't write for a month, I still got an  A- ",1
LORELAI,That was a different school.,1
RORY,"I know. It was Stars Hollow High. A  D' at Stars Hollow is like an  F' at Chilton. It's worse, it's like a  G' or a  W'.",1
LORELAI,So I'm guessing the spelling test didn't go well either?,1
RORY,A  D'. I suck.,1
LORELAI,You don't suck.,1
RORY,I can't do this.,1
LORELAI,"Listen, a  D' is bad, ok. But all this talk about  I suck' and  I can't do this' and self pity - that's worse. That's not you. You didn't feel sorry for yourself when it took you three months to learn how to ride a bike, and you won't now.",1
RORY,Four months.,1
LORELAI,Huh?,1
RORY,It took me four months,1
LORELAI,Really? Four months?,1
RORY,"Yeah, you wanna belabor the conversation?",1
LORELAI,"Alright, forget about the bike. Listen, a  D' is one grade. It's not the end of the world. You'll catch up, you'll do better. You are of hardy stubborn stock, my dear. If there's one thing I gave you, it's my stubbornness.",1
RORY,I'm not stubborn.,1
LORELAI,Yes you are.,1
RORY,No I'm not.,1
LORELAI,Fine you're not.,1
RORY,Thank you.,1
LORELAI,"You're welcome. You can do this Rory and I will help you. I will get you through this, now put that  D' behind you. Now what's next?",1
RORY,I have a test on Friday.,1
LORELAI,Ooh a test! Great!,1
RORY,It's on Shakespeare.,1
LORELAI,Bard with a beard - love it!,1
RORY,It's worth 20% of my grade.,1
LORELAI,Just makes life interesting. Now what do we have to do to get you an  A' on that test.,1
RORY,Do you really think I can do this?,1
LORELAI,I bet you a dollar.,1
RORY,That's it? That's all my future's worth - one dollar.,1
LORELAI,,1
PARIS,,1
LORELAI,"Hey, Sookie, do you know what the menu's gonna be -",1
SOOKIE,Good?,1
LORELAI,Hot.,1
SOOKIE,"Wait, I got another one Better?",1
LORELAI,Hotter!,1
SOOKIE,"Wait, I got one more - one more",1
LORELAI,"Sookie! What's with all the risotto? Have we gone  theme' now? Ooh, is it gonna be like the scotch tape store?",1
SOOKIE,"Look, I've made 40 recipes, ok, 40. And every single time I come back to the same conclusion.",1
LORELAI,That you're is better?,1
SOOKIE,Yes!,1
LORELAI,It is!,1
BRIAN,You were looking for me?,1
SOOKIE,"Yes, great! Three weeks ago, guy comes in, Lucent Mills, orders the risotto, doesn't like it.",1
BRIAN,The magic risotto? You're kidding.,1
LORELAI,Not helping.,1
SOOKIE,"He's a restaurant critic. He ordered lots of things - probably didn't finish them. Now in his review he said his waiter had a goatee. Now you've got a goatee, and so you waited on him and I need info.",1
BRIAN,Well what did he look like?,1
SOOKIE,Like he's unhappy with the risotto! Or maybe he had an annoying table companion with him that wouldn't let him concentrate on what he was eating.,1
BRIAN,Well I serve a lot of people.,1
SOOKIE,"He had a beard, or false teeth, or wig, or those glasses with a big nose.",1
BRIAN,May I be fired now?,1
LORELAI,Absolutely.,1
SOOKIE,,1

LORELAI,Except?,1
RORY,Except for 126 which is 12 lines.,1
LORELAI,Good.,1
RORY,They are written in iambic pentameter.,1
LORELAI,Except?,1
RORY,Except 145 which is in tetrameter.,1
LORELAI,Rock on sister.,1
RORY,Really?,1
LORELAI,Not one mistake.,1
RORY,Wow.,1
LORELAI,How do you feel?,1
RORY,Nauseous.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah well, I don't think the fries and the horseradish sauce was the best idea we ever had.",1
RORY,It was satisfying in the moment though,1
LORELAI,I think you're going to blow that class away tomorrow.,1
RORY,You think?,1
LORELAI,I think. What do you say we call it a night and get some beauty sleep?,1
RORY,"You go, I wanna review my notes one more time.",1
LORELAI,"Oh that's ok, I'll stay up.",1
RORY,"Mom, go to sleep.",1
LORELAI,"No, I'm not even tired. I was just thinking of you.",1

RORY,I'm late!,1
LORELAI,What?,1
RORY,"I'm late, I'm late. I woke up late!",1
LORELAI,Rory calm down.,1
RORY,I can't calm down! I missed my bus! Get up.,1
LORELAI,"Sweetie, mommy can't get up right now. Mommy's been sleeping at a right angle all night.",1
RORY,I'm gonna miss the test!,1
LORELAI,No you're not I'll get the keys. We'll go right now. Let's go! Let's go! Oh! I can't take you!,1
RORY,You have to!,1
LORELAI,I have a meet ing at the inn at 8!,1

LANE,Hello?,1
RORY,Did I leave a set of my notes at your house yesterday?,1
LANE,Where are you?,1
RORY,I'm driving to school. I need to check something and I can't find some of my notes.,1
LANE,"Ok, hold on let me check I don't seeanything.",1
RORY,What did I do with them?,1
LANE,"Well, maybe it's downstairs in the store?",1

LANE,How do you get hit by a deer?,1
RORY,I was at a stop sign and he just hit me! Oh my God!,1
LANE,Was it a 4-way stop?,1
RORY,What does that matter?,1
LANE,I don't know. I don't know what to ask after you've been hit by a deer.,1
RORY,I don't see him.,1
LANE,Well put salt down. Deers love salt.,1
RORY,Where am I gonna get salt from?,1
LANE,Do you have a lunch?,1
RORY,Lane?,1

RORY,,1
RORY,I'm sorry.,1

RORY,But what about the test?,1
MAX,I'm afraid you've missed the test.,1
RORY,No.,1
MAX,We start class promptly at 8:05,1
RORY,No.,1
MAX,That's when I need people to be in their seats.,1
RORY,Please.,1
MAX,I'm sorry but it's the rules.,1
RORY,But you don't understand! I was up all night studying and then I missed my bus so I had to drive--,1
MAX,Let's discuss this outside.,1
RORY,So I'm driving down this road and I stop and I get hit by a deer.,1
MAX,You hit a deer?,1
RORY,No I got hit by a deer. You don't believe me? I've got antler prints on the side of my mother's car.,1
MAX,"Rory, come on.",1
RORY,No! You have to let me take this test. I'm ready for this test. I know everything there is to know about Shakespeare.,1
MAX,"Ok, ok, you have to calm down now.",1
RORY,I know his birthday and his mothers name and that kind of -,1
PARIS,Loser.,1
RORY,And just what is wrong with you huh?! You already have everything! You already have the grades and the status. What the hell is wrong with you that you have this constant need to be the biggest jerk in the entire world?!,1
MAX,"Ok, let's go.",1
RORY,Huh?! What's ?! What's up quippy?! Why so silent?,1
MAX,Outside - now,1
RORY,,1
LORELAI,Make sure that carpet is replaced perfectly before they go,1
MICHELorelai,Ok.,1
LORELAI,I mean perfectly. Nailed down and everything.,1
MICHELorelai,Oh you mean that perfectly. Oh I thought you meant the other perfectly. You know the one that could be misinterpreted by the other Michel. You know the one who couldn't understand what you meant by perfectly.,1
DRELLA,Hey what do you think about Pat Benatar?,1
LORELAI,"Great idea, can she play the harp?",1
SOOKIE,"Whoo! Whoo-hoo! I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! I found it, I found it!",1
LORELAI,You found what?,1
SOOKIE,His bill! I found his bill!,1
LORELAI,What are you talking about?,1
SOOKIE,"It wasn't the risotto, it was the wine! He ordered the wrong wine!",1
LORELAI,"Oh, well great!",1
SOOKIE,"See in the review, he mentioned something about a summer tomato salad which I've only made once in the last 3 weeks because Jackson of course decides to get into a fist fight with his tomato grower - that's a different story.",1
LORELAI,Yes - save it for Christmas time.,1
SOOKIE,"So Brian, the goatee waiter, only worked one shift last week because his girlfriend kicked him out and he had to move.",1
LORELAI,Celia kicked him out?,1
SOOKIE,"Well, he didn't want kids.",1
LORELAI,But she knew that when they moved in.,1
SOOKIE,Women always think they can change men.,1
LORELAI,Yeah.,1
SOOKIE,"So anyhow, I checked the dates, I narrowed the day down and I found a party that had ordered practically everything on the menu including -",1
LORELAI,The magic risotto!,1
SOOKIE,"Yes, the risotto and a riesling. Ha! A riesling",1
LORELAI,Why not just drink battery acid.,1
SOOKIE,Exactly! Changes the entire flavor of the dish. And the fact that Brian even served it makes me think Celia is a little bit better off without him.,1
LORELAI,"I'm so glad hon, oh!",1
JACKSON,"Ok, here are the zucchinis",1
SOOKIE,"Too small, take'em away!",1
JACKSON,"Oh, it's good to have her back huh",1
LORELAI,Yeah.,1
JACKSON,Yeah You're still gonna have to pay for the zucchini,1
MICHELorelai,There is a man with a funny accent on the phone asking for you.,1
LORELAI,,1
LORELAI,Rory what happened?,1
RORY,I got hit by a deer.,1
LORELAI,You got what?,1
RORY,And then I was late and they wouldn't let me take the test.,1
LORELAI,What?!,1
RORY,They wouldn't let me take the test so I -,1
LORELAI,Oh no you're kidding me?,1
RORY,Mom...,1
LORELAI,"No, it's ok. Just sit right here, I'll handle this.",1
LORELAI,Excuse me. Hello.,1
CHARLESTON,Ms. Gilmore. Please come in.,1
LORELAI,Thank you.,1
CHARLESTON,Have a seat.,1
LORELAI,"Um, I think there's been a terrible mistake. Rory told me that she wasn't allowed to take her test.",1
CHARLESTON,She was late.,1
LORELAI,"Right, well, see there were circumstances beyond her control. Rory is never late. She's almost annoyingly on time. I think if you checked your records -",1
CHARLESTON,Past performance has nothing to do with today's situation.,1
LORELAI,"Ok, but see, she was up all night studying, I was there, she has a witness.",1
CHARLESTON,She's not on trial here.,1
LORELAI,"Well your honor just a little trial humor, that won't happen again. Um, see, she got up late, she broke her neck to get here. We don't like locally as you know.",1
CHARLESTON,The dog at my homework -,1
LORELAI,Excuse me?,1
CHARLESTON,My computer crashed and I lost my midterm.,1
LORELAI,I wasn't making excuses.,1
CHARLESTON,"My grandmother and 1st cousin died. My sister took my report to school instead of hers, my religion prohibits studying after sundown. I went blind last night but I'm fine now.",1
LORELAI,That's not Rory.,1
CHARLESTON,"Ms. Gilmore, rules are rules. When you're late, you forfeit the right to take the test.",1
LORELAI,Where are you going? Where is he going?,1
MAX,"Lorelai please, believe me if I could do anything I would.",1
LORELAI,"Yes, you could let her take the test.",1
MAX,I'm afraid I can't.,1
LORELAI,Well that's not fair.,1
CHARLESTON,"Ms. Gilmore, we are not here to be fair, we are here to educate.",1
LORELAI,Yes and I'm asking you to please educate my kid.,1
CHARLESTON,"We will, when she's on time. Have a nice day.",1
LORELAI,Are you holding that door open for a reason?,1
CHARLESTON,Our meet ing is over.,1
LORELAI,Like hell it is.,1
MAX,Lorelai.,1
LORELAI,Do you have any idea what we have gone through this week? We have been up all night every night studying. We haven't slept. We haven't talked about anything else except this school and this test for seven days. We have stretched ourselves as thin as humanly possible without going completely postal. My God! We're only one person!,1
CHARLESTON,Why don't we narrow our field conversation down to Rory.,1
LORELAI,"Ok, yeah, why don't we. You sit up here in your snotty little school that's in desperate need of some ext ra heating vents and you nurture horrible kids who treat each other like mortal enemies. You set impossible standards that make normal people feel less than everyone else. And you take a great kid like Rory and you tear her apart!",1
MAX,I don't think that's completely fair.,1
LORELAI,"And you! You say she's smart and she'll be fine and this rotting stodgy rathole could use somebody like her and then you completely shut her out of a test that she's crammed for, that she's ready for, that she completely deserves to take!",1
MAX,I didn't call this place a  rathole',1
LORELAI,"Oh no that's true. I added that. Wouldn't want you to get in trouble with  Il duce' here. I thought this place was going to be so great! And now I guess this goes on the  Boy was I wrong' list, right above gauchos but just below the  Flashdance' phase.",1
CHARLESTON,My goodness you do like to throw fits in your family.,1
LORELAI,What are you talking about?,1
CHARLESTON,Your daughter threw a similar if not as manic fit of her own this morning.,1
LORELAI,Please. Rory doesn't throw fits. She's the most even tempered person I know.,1
CHARLESTON,"Well then, she did a lovely impression of you.",1
LORELAI,Well I don't -,1
CHARLESTON,"Ms. Gilmore, everything you said in your rant was absolutely true - without the colorful embellishments of course. We do set impossible standards, and such standards do foster highly competitive children. However that is life and that is Chilton.",1
LORELAI,"Rules can change, you can change them.",1
CHARLESTON,"I told your daughter when she came here that this place was not for everyone and might not be for her. I will now tell you the same thing. She doesn't have to be here. She doesn't have to go to Harvard, maybe she shouldn't if she can't handle the pressure, she should leave. Now you can take your daughter home now and decide what it is you intend to do. However, another outburst from eit her of you will not be on the options list. Thank you for coming in. That will be all. CUT TO",1
HALLWAYLORELAI,You got hit by a deer?,1
LORELAI,You did! You got hit by a deer.,1
RORY,It just came out of nowhere.,1
LORELAI,You couldn't just run into a wall like other kids.,1
RORY,Can we just go home please.,1
LORELAI,,1
LUCENT,May I help you?,1
SOOKIE,"Yes, hello My name is Sookie St. James, I'm the chef at the Independence Inn.",1
LUCENT,I know who you are.,1
SOOKIE,"You do? Well, I'm flattered, you write about a lot of chefs -",1
LUCENT,What are you doing here?,1
SOOKIE,Right. Well I know that this is a terrible intrusion but - are you cooking?,1
LUCENT,I'm mak ing chicken.,1
SOOKIE,You used too much salt.,1
LUCENT,I did not,1
SOOKIE,Well it smells salty.,1
LUCENT,I'm closing the door.,1
SOOKIE,No wait. I found out your address from my network of culinary friends -,1
LUCENT,"Look, this is really inappropriate. I gave you a good review, I suggest you go home.",1
SOOKIE,,1
LORELAI,Quite a day huh?,1
RORY,I don't wanna talk - please.,1
LORELAI,"You know, I just think that we should talk about it.",1
RORY,Stop the car.,1
LORELAI,What?,1
RORY,Here - stop here.,1
LORELAI,You're just feeling like an impromptu nature walk?,1
RORY,I wanna see if it's ok.,1
LORELAI,If what's ok?,1
RORY,The deer.,1
LORELAI,Sweetie you're never gonna find the deer.,1
RORY,Well I'm gonna try.,1
LORELAI,Well I'm in heels!,1
RORY,Well stay in the car.,1
LORELAI,It's dangerous in the car with all the kamikaze deer running around,1
RORY,I have to find it.,1
LORELAI,"Alright, wait up! So what does the deer look like? Huh? Does it have any distinguishing marks - besides the word  Jeep' imprinted on it's forehead.",1
RORY,It's just a deer.,1
LORELAI,I had a nice chat with Headmaster Charleston today. He said you went ballistic in class.,1
RORY,I was just tired.,1
LORELAI,You wouldn't have been so tired if you hadn't been k*lling yourself all week.,1
RORY,"I was studying, I didn't have a choice.",1
LORELAI,Well maybe you shouldn't be studying that hard.,1
RORY,What are you talking about?,1
LORELAI,You're 16. You should get some sleep and eat a real meal and come up for air once in a while.,1
RORY,They kicked me out.,1
LORELAI,"No, of course not. They love you. This is coming from me.",1
RORY,Are you saying I should quit?,1
LORELAI,"I'm saying, if you wanted to go back to your other school with Lane, that would be fine with me.",1
RORY,You don't think I can do it.,1
LORELAI,"You know that's not true. I think you can do anything. But you don't lose it in class. That's not part of the Rory personality description and if you're losing it in class because you're tired or stressed or working to hard, I'm worried about that. I have to be.",1
RORY,I lost it once.,1
LORELAI,"Ok, fine. It's just I can't rememb er, you know, a time when we weren't talking about you going to Harvard. It was just a given, that what we were working for. Everything went in that direction.",1
RORY,I know.,1
LORELAI,And I'm forgetting where all that started.,1
RORY,What are you talking about?,1
LORELAI,I'm talking about - did it start with me? Or did it start with you? Was it my dream that you go to Harvard.,1
RORY,Mom.,1
LORELAI,"Because I never got to do the big fancy college thing? Maybe all this time I'm thinking it's all for Rory, when really it wasn't.",1
RORY,I'm not doing this because of you.,1
LORELAI,"Because if you are, you don't have to.",1
RORY,I know that.,1
LORELAI,I'll still love you. Even if you can't support me in my old age in the fabulous manner to which I plan on growing accustomed.,1
RORY,I'll rememb er that generous gesture.,1
LORELAI,Thank you. I just want you to be happy.,1
RORY,I am.,1
LORELAI,"No, I want you to be  dancing through the woods crazy' happy. And if Chilton and Harvard is not gonna do that for you, then forget about them.",1
RORY,"I was just behind. I never caught up with all the reading. That's why I got a  D'. I can catch up. I will catch up and when I do, everything will be fine.",1
LORELAI,Rory.,1
RORY,"You know Harvard is my dream. I want it more than anything, I swear",1
LORELAI,Yeah but -,1
RORY,I appreciate all that you're saying. I do. But I'm not ready to give up on Chilton yet.,1
LORELAI,Fair enough.,1
RORY,,1
LORELAI,That's your prerogative as long as you remain a woman.,1
RORY,Thanks though.,1
LORELAI,For what?,1
RORY,For yelling at the Headmaster the way you did.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, I didn't yell at him.",1
RORY,You called him  il duce',1
LORELAI,Which means  kind sir' in Cantonese.,1
RORY,Thank you.,1
LORELAI,You're welcome. How much longer are we gonna look for this crazy deer?,1
RORY,Just a little further. I just hope he didn't hurt himself.,1
LORELAI,,1
LORELAI,"Go get that plaid skirt off and grab your books, we're going to Luke's.",1
RORY,Don't you have to get back to work?,1
LORELAI,"Ah, they can last a little while longer without me. Plus Michel gets so cute when he feels like he's been overworked. His ears puff out, his nostrils flare, big fun. Go.",1
RORY,I'm gone.,1
LORELAI,"It's us, we're not here. We have a life, get over it.",1

EMILY,"Tomorrow our lawyer, Joseph Stanford, is coming by.",1
LORELAI,Ugh. Crazy Sissy's dad.,1
EMILY,That's terrible. Sissy was a good friend of yours.,1
LORELAI,"Mom, Sissy talked to her stuffed animals and they answered her.",1
RORY,Let's just start a new topic.,1
EMILY,Not possible!,1
LORELAI,"She said a new topic, Mom.",1
EMILY,Everything's a joke. Everyone's a punch line.,1
LORELAI,"OK, I'm sorry.",1
EMILY,My daughter -- Henny Youngman.,1
RICHARD,Sorry for that. A little trouble with our China office. Well. What did I miss?,1
LORELAI,I was being impossible and then I turned into a Jewish comedian.,1
RICHARD,"Ah. Well, continue.",1
EMILY,Thank you. Where was I?,1
RORY,"Uh, Joseph Stanford is coming tomorrow.",1
EMILY,"Yes. So, Rory, your grandfather and I thought it might be nice after dinner for you to go around the house and pick out what you'd like us to leave you in our wills.",1
RICHARD,Take a look at that desk in my office. It's a really fine Georgian piece.,1
LORELAI,Why don't I ever bring a tape recorder to these dinners?,1
RORY,"Oh, well, anything you want to leave me is fine.",1
EMILY,Nonsense. You should have what you like. So look around and when you see something,1
youPosted,11/14/00 02:49like stick a post-it on it.,1
LORELAI,"OK, you two have officially hit a new level of weird that even I marvel at.",1
EMILY,"You can pick out things too, you know.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, well now it's way less creepy.",1
EMILY,Did you hear that Richard? Apparently we're creepy.,1
RICHARD,"Yes, well, live and learn.",1
RORY,Oh cool!,1
LORELAI,What's that?,1
EMILY,It's dessert.,1
LORELAI,It's pudding.,1
EMILY,Well if you knew what it was why did you ask?,1
LORELAI,You don't like pudding.,1
EMILY,"Yes, but you like pudding.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, I love pudding. I worship it. I have a bowl up on the mantel at home with the Virgin Mary, a glass of wine, and a dollar bill next to it.",1
RORY,I've never had pudding from a crystal bowl before. EMILY You like the bowl?,1
RORY,Mmm.,1
EMILY,Put a post-it on it when you're done.,1
LORELAI,So what do we think of this?,1
RORY,Where would we put it?,1
LORELAI,I don't know. The Emily and Richard Gilmore Psycho Museum?,1
RORY,This is the strangest evening I've ever spent here.,1
EMILY,"So, how's it going?",1
LORELAI,"Great, just getting ready for the big day.",1
EMILY,Very nice.,1
LORELAI,"So, um, it's getting late, Mom. Unless you've got some funeral plots for us to decorate weshould really be going.",1
EMILY,Any special requests for dinner next week?,1
RORY,"Oh, well --",1
LORELAI,"Mom, I want to talk to you for a minute, and Rory, why don't you go say goodbye to Grandpa...",1
RORY,Very smooth.,1
EMILY,Should I sit down?,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, but not there, OK? We got a post-it on that. We'd like to keep it nice.",1
EMILY,It must be very exhausting to be you.,1
LORELAI,"Mom, Rory's birthday is next Friday.",1
EMILY,I know that.,1
LORELAI,So we were thinking that maybe we could push our dinner next week to Saturday.,1
EMILY,What are you going to do on Friday?,1
LORELAI,Oh I don't know.,1
EMILY,Well perfect. You'll come here and we'll have a little party.,1
LORELAI,I was just hoping we could do it another night.,1
EMILY,Well why come on another night when her birthday falls on the exact night that you do come here.,1
LORELAI,"Saturday's a pretty good night, Mom.",1
EMILY,Not as good as Friday.,1
LORELAI,Pretty damn close.,1
EMILY,Not from where I'm standing.,1
LORELAI,"Well, move then.",1
EMILY,I'm sorry. Friday nights are my nights. That's what we agreed on when you borrowed money for her school. The rules haven't changed.,1
LORELAI,"Mom, I didn't intend for this loan to become a constant source of blackmail, OK? Now this is my kid's birthday and she will have her party at home on Friday and that's it? End of story.",1
LORELAI,"So, how would you like two parties this year?",1
RORY,You couldn't get her to cave.,1
LORELAI,"No, but she did agree to make the string quartet to learn ""Like A Virgin.""",1
RORY,"Well, you tried.",1
LORELAI,"Sweetie, I promise, Saturday night we'll do it up right at home. A Stars Hollow extravaganza.",1
RORY,"So, is this party Grandma's having going to be a big deal?",1
LORELAI,Not really. The government will close that day. Flags will fly at half-mast. Barbra Streisand will give her final concert...again.,1
RORY,Uh-huh.,1
LORELAI,"Now, the Pope has previous plans, but he's trying to get out of them. However, Elvis and Jim Morrison are coming and they're bringing chips.",1
RORY,You ask a simple question...,1
SOOKIE,Mini orange biscuits with honey-mustard ham and cheddar cheese.,1
LORELAI,Yum.,1
SOOKIE,Angel wings with dipping sauce.,1
LORELAI,"Good, good.",1
SOOKIE,"Oh, did you bring me the picture?",1
LORELAI,"Oh, yes.",1
SOOKIE,Too bad you couldn't get your mom to relinquish Friday night.,1
LORELAI,"No, she has her Vulcan death grip on that one.",1
SOOKIE,Not that surprising though.,1
LORELAI,"Emily Gilmore -- you could set your watch by her. Oh, you know what she did do last night?",1
SOOKIE,Wore jeans?,1
LORELAI,Served pudding.,1
SOOKIE,I was close!,1
LORELAI,"I mean, I'm sure it was some ex pensive form of pudding, but nonetheless, it was pudding!",1
SOOKIE,That is amazing.,1
LORELAI,"Right. That would mean that she actually made a mental note that we liked pudding, which would mean that she actually listened to something other than the judgmental conga linegoing on in her head, and got over the fact that, to her, pudding is hospital food, and only acceptable when you've just had vital organ ripped out of your body.",1
SOOKIE,"Wow, that's some journey she had to take there.",1
JACKSON,Open your mouth and close your eyes.,1
LORELAI,Who are you talking to?,1
JACKSON,"Right, sorry. Open your mouth and close your eyes.",1
SOOKIE,OK.,1
JACKSON,Now get ready for something truly amazing.,1
SOOKIE,Mmm!,1
JACKSON,Huh? Huh?,1
LORELAI,What is it?,1
SOOKIE,"I don't know. It's like, um...",1
JACKSON,A what?,1
SOOKIE,"It's like a berry, but way more exotic.",1
JACKSON,Yes! Good.,1
LORELAI,"Jackson, have you been having reactions to your fertilizer fumes again?",1
JACKSON,For some time now I've been toying with cross-pollination. Finally I've got it. I figured out a way to cross a raspberry with a kumquat.,1
SOOKIE,Kumquat! That's what I taste! Are you serious? How did you do this?,1
LORELAI,"You didn't build one of those machines like in ""The Fly"" did you? We're not going to find you wandering the streets wearing a raspberry head crying, ""eat me!"" JACKSON You! You can make fun of me all you want to today, 'cause tday I am a god. Today, Mother Nature has bowed down to me.",1
MICHELorelai,How nice for her.,1
LORELAI,"Michel, Jackson --",1
MICHELorelai,No need to fill me in . I'm quite happy being ignorant of whatever it is that is making him raise his arms over his head.,1
LORELAI,Do you need me?,1
MICHELorelai,The landscaper does.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, hey, Rory's birthday party is Saturday night so start thinking up reasons why you can't come.",1
MICHELorelai,I'm going to be out of town.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, you used that last year.",1
MICHELorelai,I'll work on it and get back to you,1
LORELAI,"7:00, presents mandatory.",1
MICHELorelai,Mm-hmm.,1
JACKSON,Rasquat?,1
LORELAI,"Lucy, I'm home!",1
RORY,Kitchen.,1
LORELAI,"'And Justin is just so dreamy. He can't marry Britney, I'll just cry and cry and cry.'",1
RORY,"OK, thanks. Pizza's on its way.",1
LORELAI,You're such a good provider. Hi.,1
RORY,I'm going to start my homework. Call me when the pizza guy gets here.,1
LORELAI,Hello?,1
EMILY,"Lorelai, what is your work schedule?",1
LORELAI,Why?,1
EMILY,I want to go shopping.,1
LORELAI,With me?,1
EMILY,I think that goes without saying.,1
LORELAI,"Only in your world, Mom.",1
EMILY,I want to get Rory a birthday present.,1
LORELAI,"Well I'm sure whatever you get her, she'll love.",1
EMILY,"Yes, but I want to get her something special, something she wants, something...that you would get her.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, OK, fine. You can get her the bong then.",1
EMILY,This isn't funny. I hardly to see the girl and we only get to talk at dinner once a week andthen it's all about school and Jane.,1
LORELAI,"Lane, Mom.",1
EMILY,I thought you might let me in to her secret club just this one time and help me buy her something for her birthday.,1
LORELAI,You're serious?,1
EMILY,According to you I'm always serious.,1
LORELAI,OK.,1
EMILY,OK?,1
LORELAI,OK.,1
EMILY,"Well, good, I'll meet you at Damion's tomorrow at 3:00",1
LORELAI,OK.,1
EMILY,And dress appropriately --,1
LORELAI,Don't finish that sentence Mom.,1
EMILY,I'll see you tomorrow.,1
LORELAI,Thatagirl.,1
TRISTIN,Hey.,1
RORY,"What, Tristin?",1
TRISTIN,I just wanted to say 'happy birthday.',1
RORY,It's not my birthday.,1
TRISTIN,"No, but it will be. 'On Friday at 4:03 in the morning, Lorelai Leigh - -'",1
RORY,What is that?,1
RORY,Who else got these?,1
TRISTIN,"I don't know. Everyone in our class, I think. RORY I have to go.",1
TRISTIN,"I'll see you Friday, birthday girl.",1
LOUISE,That's her. GIRL #2: My parents are making me go.,1
LOUISE,Another obligation party. GIRL #2: My life stinks.,1
EMILY,"Oh, isn't this lovely?",1
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah. As soon as we have her crowned Queen of England we'll give it to her.",1
EMILY,You are so combative today.,1
LORELAI,"Hatwear does that to me. Oh, Mom, look. This is good.",1
EMILY,What is that?,1
LORELAI,It's a purse shaped like a guitar. This is great.,1
EMILY,Great for what?,1
LORELAI,For Rory.,1
EMILY,What will Rory do with that?,1
LORELAI,She'll put stuff in it. Carry it around.,1
EMILY,In public?,1
LORELAI,Yeah.,1
EMILY,What will people think?,1
LORELAI,"That she's an ax m*rder, of course.",1
EMILY,What about pearls?,1
LORELAI,Pearls? EMILY A double string of pearls with a cashmere sweater set.,1
LORELAI,"Mom, she's a young girl. Think of something young.",1
EMILY,A Mont Blanc pen?,1
LORELAI,To put on her desk at the law firm?,1
EMILY,She needs to write.,1
LORELAI,"Well not with a $200 pen, she doesn't. Oh, hey, look. These day planners are adorable. You could get her one of those funky erasers with a mermaid on it. She'll love that.",1
EMILY,"Please be serious, we're shopping for Rory.",1
LORELAI,"No, Mom, I'm shopping for Rory. You're shopping for your imaginary granddaughter, Barbara Hutton.",1
EMILY,I want to get her something nice.,1
LORELAI,"I know you do, but you're not listening to me.",1
EMILY,You wanted me to get her a Filofax and a mermaid eraser.,1
LORELAI,It's one suggestion,1
EMILY,"Oh, yes, and there was a T-shirt with a Farrah Fawcett face.",1
LORELAI,A hero to many who aspire to the perfect feather fluff.,1
EMILY,Oh I don't know how to do this. Let's just go.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, no, no. Come on, Mom. You do know how to do this. Think pudding.",1
EMILY,Pudding?,1
LORELAI,"Come on. You asked for my help. You're reaching out. A little -- not a lot -- don't get freaked. But, Mom -- pudding.",1
EMILY,Why do you keep saying pudding?,1
LORELAI,"Listen, just look around and pick up something she might like.",1
EMILY,Here.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, now that's really good.",1
EMILY,Really?,1
LORELAI,Absolutely.,1
EMILY,Doesn't look like something you could buy at a car wash?,1
LORELAI,Totally. That's half the charm.,1
EMILY,"Oh, no, it's only $12.",1
LORELAI,Six dollars more than a car wash.,1
EMILY,Twelve dollars is not a present.,1
LORELAI,"Twelve dollars is a perfect present, Mom. She'll love that.",1
EMILY,Can I at least get her the pashmina also?,1
EMILY,"Fine, I'll get it.",1
LORELAI,Good choice. EMILY Oh! It lights up.,1
LUKE,She's not here yet.,1
LORELAI,"All right. You'll have to entertain me until she arrives. OK, Burger Boy, dance.",1
LUKE,Will you marry me?,1
LORELAI,What?,1
LUKE,Just looking for something to shut you up.,1
LORELAI,You better be nice to me or I'm not inviting you to Rory Gilmore's birthday celebration this Saturday night.,1
LUKE,"You don't have to ask me, you know.",1
LORELAI,I know. But I would like you to come.,1
LUKE,Yeah?,1
LORELAI,Yeah.,1
LUKE,"OK, I'll see.",1
LORELAI,7:00. Don't be late.,1
LORELAI,Wow. Nice face you got on there.,1
RORY,Coffee.,1
LORELAI,Bad day?,1
RORY,I've now used the word 'sucks' so much that it's lost all meaning to me.,1
LORELAI,Well maybe this will cheer you up.,1
RORY,What?,1
LORELAI,You'll see.,1
RORY,What is that?,1
LORELAI,These are our party dresses.,1
RORY,So it's a Halloween party?,1
LORELAI,"Listen, you. So I'm shopping today with your grandmother and it's a whole three hours of ""Who are you buying that for, Mom? Have you met Rory?"" and then finally I talked and she listened and she wound up getting you something I think you're really going to like.",1
RORY,Really?,1
LORELAI,"Yes, really. And of course she insisted on buying us these dresses but I think I can do something with them to make them better.",1
RORY,Wow. I've never seen you so cheery after spending time with Grandma.,1
LORELAI,Well it's been a long time since we got together and didn't end up fighting. It was refreshing. It wasn't exactly fun but I didn't get that sh**ting pain in my eye like I usually do.,1
RORY,Wow. That's great. LORELAI :Yeah.,1
LUKE,So I hear you're having a party Saturday.,1
RORY,Yeah. Mom's famous for her blowouts.,1
LORELAI,The best one was her eighth birthday.,1
RORY,"Oh, yeah, that was good.",1
LORELAI,The cops shut us down.,1
LUKE,The cops shut down an eight year old's birthday party?,1
RORY,And arrested the clown.,1
LUKE,I don't want to hear any more of this.,1
LORELAI,"So, now tell me, why Miss Lemonhead today?",1
RORY,Nothing. I-I'm fine. I just got an A- on a French test that I should have gotten an A on.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, honey, an A- is awesome.",1
RORY,"Yeah, it's - it's fine.",1
LOREAI,Let me see. Maybe we should really embrace the whole tulle thing. Go totally modern Cinderella. What do you think? It's your birthday.,1
RORY,Yeah. Lucky me.,1
LORELAI,Happy birthday. little girl.,1
RORY,Hey.,1
LORELAI,I can't believe how fast you're growing up.,1
RORY,Really? Feels slow.,1
LORELAI,"Trust me, it's fast. What do you think of your life so far?",1
RORY,I think it's pretty good.,1
LORELAI,Any complaints?,1
RORY,I'd like that whole humidity thing to go away.,1
LORELAI,All right. I'll work on that.,1
RORY,So do I look older?,1
LORELA,"Oh, yeah. You walk into Denny's before 5, you've got yourself a discount.",1
RORY,Good deal.,1
LORELAI,So you know what I think?,1
RORY,What?,1
LORELAI,"I think you're a great, cool kid, and the best friend a girl could have.",1
RORY,Right back at ya.,1
LORELAI,"And it's so hard to believe that at exactly this time many moons ago, I was lying in exactly the same position --",1
RORY,"Oh, boy. Here we go.",1
LORELAI,"Only I had a huge, fat stomach and big fat ankles and I was swearing like a sailor --",1
RORY,On leave.,1
LORELAI,On leave -- right! And there I was --,1
RORY,In labor.,1
LORELAI,"And while some have called it the most meaningful experience of your life, to me it was something more akin to doing the splits on a crate of dynamite.",1
RORY,I wonder if the Waltons ever did this.,1
LORELAI,"And I was screaming and swearing and being surrounded as I was by a hundred prominent doctors, I just assumed there was an actual use for the cup of ice chips they gave me.",1
RORY,There wasn't.,1
LORELAI,But pelting the nurses sure was fun.,1
RORY,"I love you, Mom.",1
LORELAI,Shh. I'm getting to the part where he sees your head. So there I was...,1
LANE,You should not have to go to school today.,1
RORY,Have to. Latin test.,1
LANE,Jeez. Every day you have a test. When do you have time to learn anything to be tested on?,1
LUKE,"Hey, wrong table.",1
RORY,Since when is there a right table?,1
LUKE,"Since the coffee cake I baked for you and the stupid balloons I blew up are at that table, over there.",1
RORY,You blew up balloons for me?,1
LUKE,Yep.,1
RORY,"Oh, Luke, you old softie.",1
LUKE,"I count to three, it's gone.",1
RORY,Thank you.,1
LANE,Are you OK?,1
RORY,"Yeah, I'm just...I'm getting old, Lane.",1
LANE,You seem a little quiet this morning.,1
RORY,"I'm just dreading this whole night. I mean, it's bad enough that I have to see these stupid kids from Ch ilton every day. But tonight? On my birthday? I've never even talked to most of them. I mean, I've only been going to this school for a couple months. God, they're gonna think I am the biggest freak and I need my grandma to get people to come to my party.",1
LANE,Well what did Lorelai say when you told her?,1
RORY,I didn't.,1
LANE,Why not?,1
RORY,Because of the pudding.,1
LANE,"Oh, the pudding. Right, I forgot about the pudding.",1
RORY,"My grandmother served us pudding the other night and then she went shopping with my mom and they didn't fight. I don't know, I mean, they never get along, and now suddenly they're getting along, and I knew that if I told Mom about the invites she'd wig out and call Grandma and that would be the end of the pudding.",1
LANE,You know you can buy pudding.,1
RORY,"It's one night, right?",1
LANE,Right.,1
RORY,I can stand it for one night. (Dean walks into the diner. He looks over at Rory as he shuts the door then goes to the counter.,1
DEAN,"Coffee to go, please.",1
LUKE,Here you go.,1
DEAN,Thanks.,1
LANE,Why are you smiling?,1
RORY,I'm just thinking about pudding.,1
EMILY,"No, not there. In the living room. Why are you touching that? Why are you touching that? Well don't. I want those six inches apart! Get a ruler.",1
RICHARD,Emily!,1
EMILY,Let me do that.,1
RICHARD,I hope the Larsons are coming tonight.,1
EMILY,"Richard, no business. This is your granddaughter's party.",1
RICHARD,Five minutes of shop talk isn't going to spoil the evening.,1
EMILY,"Five minutes, please.",1
RICHARD,Emily.,1
EMILY,"If I ever heard you keep your shop talk down to five minutes, I'd drop dead.",1
RICHARD,Emily.,1
EMILY,In fact I could drop dead and you wouldn't stop talking business. You'd just step right over mybody to get to the speakerphone.,1
RICHARD,Emily.,1
EMILY,What?,1
RICHARD,You look very nice tonight.,1
EMILY,Thank you.,1
LORELAI,"Jeez, Mom. Leave some servants for the rest of the neighborhood.",1
EMILY,There she is -- the birthday girl.,1
RORY,Hi Grandma.,1
LORELAI,"Wow, you really went all out, huh? EMILY Well I wanted everything to be perfect. What do you think?",1
LORELAI,"I think Edith Wharton would have been proud, and busy taking notes.",1
LORELAI,"Here, babe, go change.",1
RORY,OK.,1
EMILY,Hurry!,1
EMILY,What is that?,1
LORELAI,"Oh, that's my dress.",1
EMILY,Where's the one I bought you?,1
LORELAI,This is it.,1
EMILY,I thought there was more of it.,1
LORELAI,"Gee, Mom, the place looks great.",1
EMILY,Did you turn Rory's into a hat?,1
LORELAI,Nice candles. Six inches apart?,1
RICHARD,You're drinking white wine tonight? No Scotch?,1
LORELAI,Excuse me. I'm going to sit over there with my daughter.,1
GUEST,OK.,1
LORELAI,Here.,1
RORY,What is it?,1
LORELAI,Shirley Temple.,1
RORY,What are you drinking?,1
LORELAI,A Shirley Temple Black.,1
RORY,Wow.,1
LORELAI,"I got your Good Ship Lollipop right here, mister. So do you want something to eat?",1
RORY,Everything smells funny.,1
EMILY,"There you are. Come, there's some people I want you to meet.",1
MITZI,Lorelai?,1
LORELAI,"Yeah. Oh my God! Oh, Mitzie, wow, I haven't seen you since --",1
MITZI,Your seventh month.,1
LORELAI,"I was going to say high school, but OK.",1
MITZI,"Oh, no, did I say something rude?",1
LORELAI,"No, no.",1
MITZI,"No, I did. I said something rude. I've been trying to work on that.",1
LORELAI,"Well, a noble goal.",1
MITZI,"Ever since my divorce, I've been really trying to work on myself. You know, I just -- I want to grow.",1
LORELAI,Uh-huh.,1
MITZI,"Lorelai Gilmore, the scandal girl! Now, tell me, what ever happened with Christopher?",1
LORELAI,Christopher is in California.,1
MITZI,"Oh, do you hear from him?",1
LORELAI,Uh --,1
MITZI,"I'm sorry, is this painful for you to talk about?",1
LORELAI,"Uh, well --",1
MITZI,When did he last call you?,1
LORELAI,"God, you're making progress with that rude thing, huh, Mitz?",1
MITZI,I'm sorry.,1
LORELAI,"It's OK. He calls like once a week and we see him at Christmas, sometimes Easter. It's all very civil.",1
MITZI,So are you married now?,1
LORELAI,"No, it's just me an d Rory.",1
MITZI,Your cat?,1
LORELAI,My kid! She's right over there.,1
MITZI,"Oh. Wow! You can really see Christopher in her, can't you?",1
LORELAI,"Yes, you can.",1
MITZI,Does that k*ll you?,1
LORELAI,"You know, what? I see...someone...else...and it's been great.",1
RICHARD,"Oh, no, those aren't the terms we agreed on.",1
LARS,They most certainly are.,1
RICHARD,"Lars, you were at the same me eting I was. We specifically spelled out a five year extention, not a three year one.",1
LARS,I heard three.,1
RORY,Hi Grandpa!,1
RICHARD,"Rory. Gentlemen, this is my granddaughter, Rory.",1
LARS,"Happy birthday, Rory.",1
LARS,I think we should Dennis on the phone right now.,1
RICHARD,"Fine, I've got a phone in my office.",1
EMILY,"Rory, there's a whole group of your school friends in the library. Let's go say hello to them.",1
RORY,I have to go to the bathroom.,1
EMILY,"Just say hello first. Come on, I'll hold those for you. KID #3: Who's that? KID #4: I think it's her party. KID #3: Oh.",1
RORY,Paris?,1
PARIS,My parents made me come.,1
RORY,Oh God!,1
PARIS,"Otherwise I wouldn't be here. You believe me, don't you? (Rory walks away from Paris and sees Tristin coming in the front door.",1
TRISTIN,"Oh, coming to greet me?",1
RORY,"Hello, Tristin.",1
TRISTIN,So where's my birthday kiss?,1
RORY,It's my birthday.,1
TRISTIN,So I'll give you a birthday kiss.,1
RORY,What is wrong with you?,1
TRISTIN,"Ok, I gotta tell you something. I'm madly in love with you.",1
RORY,"Well, good luck with that.",1
TRISTIN,"I can't eat, I can't sleep...I wake up in the middle of the night calling your name. Rory, Rory!",1
RORY,Would you shut up please?,1
RICHARD,"Rory, who's your friend?",1
RORY,I don't know but this is Tristin.,1
RICHARD,Excuse me?,1
TRISTIN,"Tristin Dugray, sir.",1
RICHARD,Dugray? Are you any relation to Janlen Dugray?,1
RICHARD,"That's my grandfather, sir.",1
RICHARD,Well I've done business with Janlen for years. He's a fine man.,1
TRISTIN,That he is.,1
RICHARD,"Rory, you've got very good taste in friends. I approve.",1
LARS,"Richard, I've got Dennis on the phone and he heard the same thing I heard.",1
RICHARD,"Well, one wrong man can always find a friend.",1
TRISTIN,He likes me.,1
RORY,He's drunk. TRISTIN Let's take a walk.,1
RORY,This is stuipd. you don't even like me! You just have this weird need to prove that I'll go out with you. That's not liking someone.,1
TRISTIN,Why are you fighting this? You're gonna give in eventually.,1
RORY,I'm going to go find my mother.,1
TRISTIN,"Wow, meet ing your mom. It's a bit sudden, but OK.",1
EMILY,Oh there you are! I think it's time that you said a few words to your guests.,1
RORY,What?,1
EMILY,Just a little speech to say thank you and tell everyone how it feels to be one year older.,1
LORELAI,"Mom, I don't she wants--",1
EMILY,"She's the hostess, Lorelai. This is her responsibility.",1
RORY,I am not the hostess! You are!,1
LORELAI,"Hey, honey, hold on...",1
RORY,"This is your party and these are your guests and I don't have anything to say to them, so you give the speech.",1
EMILY,Rory!,1
RORY,Excuse me.,1
LORELAI,What was that all about?,1
EMILY,"Lorelai, your daughter has no manners whatsoever. You should be ashamed of yourself.",1
LORELAI,"OK, how did this become my fault?",1
LORELAI,Hey. Can I come in ?,1
RORY,It's your room.,1
LORELAI,How are you doing?,1
RORY,I'm sorry I snapped at Grandma.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, hugh? That was a pretty 'Freaky Friday' moment we had back there.",1
RORY,She just went ahead and invited all these kids from Chilton.,1
LORELAI,You're kidding. I thought she checked on that with you.,1
RORY,She didn't ask me or tell me.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, man, I'm so sorry.",1
RORY,It just -- I don't know but it really made me mad.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, honey, why didn't you tell me?",1
RORY,"Because you were happy. I mean, it's not very often that there's peace between the two of you. I didn't want to screw everything up.",1
LORELAI,"Rory, I appreciate you wanting you wanting Mom and I to get along but you shouldn't keep stuff like that from me.",1
RORY,"I feel terrible. I mean, I've never yelled at her before.",1
LORELAI,"Listen, you'll apologize, all will be forgotten. You'll see. Man. It's like time has stood still in this room.",1
RORY,It must be weird for you to be in this room now.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, it was weird for me to be in this room then. You know, they gave this to me w ith the glass on.",1
RORY,I now officially know what it feels like to have grown up here.,1
LORELAI,It's not official until you're huddled in the corner eating your hair.,1
RORY,Do you rememb er your last birthday here?,1
LORELAI,Yeah. We had just had a fight and I was lying on the bed just like you are now.,1
RORY,What did you fight about?,1
LORELAI,"Well, I was pregnant.",1
RORY,"Oh, that.",1
LORELAI,And I said something at the table about the pate smelling like Clorox and one thing led to another and I wound up here. I hadn't told anybody yet about me. And you.,1
RORY,That must have been really hard on you.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah. I rememb er when I finally told them, it was the only time they ever looked small to me.",1
RORY,I guess I'd better go find Grandma.,1
LORELAI,Mmm. Give her a minute.,1
EMILY,There you are!,1
LORELAI,"She'll find us. EMILY You are both being very rude. This isn't my birthday party, you know.",1
LORELAI,"Sorry, Mom.",1
EMILY,"Honestly, the way the two of you act.",1
RORY,"Grandma, I just want to --",1
EMILY,We'll talk about this later. Now go.,1
EMILY,"Thank you, good to see you. Lovely as always, Leeza. My best to Darren.",1
LORELAI,"Hey, Mom. Great party. One of your best. I even liked those brown mushroom things.",1
RORY,"Grandma, can I talk to you for a sec?",1
EMILY,"Richard, the girls are leaving.",1
RICHARD,"Well, Rory, I hope you had a good time.",1
RORY,"Yes, I did.",1
RICHARD,"Now, I know that your grandmother has already bought you a gift and signed my name to it. That was part of our agreement when we got married. However, I feel this occasion calls for something a little extra. Put that towards your trip to Fez.",1
RORY,"Oh, Grandpa!",1
RICHARD,"You're a good girl, Rory. Happy birthday.",1
RORY,I don't deserve this.,1
LORELAI,"Fine, hand it over.",1
EMILY,You girls should get going. You've got quite a drive ahead of you.,1
RORY,"Grandma, we're having a party tomorrow at our house and -- I mean, it won't be anything like this but it will be fun and maybe you and Grandpa can come?",1
EMILY,"That's very sweet, dear, but I'm afraid we already have plans.",1
RORY,"Oh, Ok.",1
EMILY,"Have a safe trip. Lock the door behind you, OK?",1
LORELAI,"Hey, um, why don't you go help that guy out there put all the presents in the car.",1
RORY,OK.,1
EMILY,All this can go in the dishwasher.,1
LORELAI,"Mom, come to the party tomorrow.",1
EMILY,"I can't. I'm busy. Throw those out, we won't need them.",1
LORELAI,"Mom, your granddaughter invited you to her birthday party. Please, come.",1
EMILY,"I've already been to a party for my granddaughter and she humilitated me in front of all of my friends. I have no desire to relive that experience. The cheeses must be put in individual bags, please.",1
LORELAI,"Oh come on, give her a break. You invited all these Chilton kids without even asking her.",1
EMILY,They're her schoolmates. I assumed they were her friends,1
LORELAI,"You know what they say when people assume things. EMILY No, what do they say?",1
LORELAI,That -- you shouldn't.,1
EMILY,Very clever.,1
LORELAI,"Mom, she didn't want them here. She doesn't like them.",1
EMILY,"Well I had to invite them. That's just good manners, something that your daughter is sorely lacking.",1
LORELAI,"God, you know, you're doing the same thing to her that you always did to me. You're trying to control her and when that doesn't work you just shut her out.",1
EMILY,I'm too tired for your accusations right now. Can we do this tomorrow?,1
LORELAI,I'm just --,1
EMILY,"Here, I'll find you a pen so you can write down all your insults so that you won't forget them.",1
LORELAI,"Mom, this is not funny. I have a crushed kid out in the car.",1
EMILY,"What do you want me to say? Everything's fine, it's forgotten. There, I'll see you next week.",1
LORELAI,"So I guess the whole pudding thing was just a fluke, huh? Trying to get to know us, easing up on the rules, smuding that bottom line of yours. It was just some weird phase. What, you were on cold medicine last week or something?",1
EMILY,"Oh, so I'm a villan now, is that it? I spent a fortune on this party. I spent days planning it, making sure that every little detail was perfect -- the food, the linen, the music. And I did all this for Rory.",1
LORELAI,Well that's not what she needs. She needs you to accept her apology and come to her party. That's what she needs. You don't care what she needs.,1
EMILY,How dare you!,1
LORELAI,You don't even know what she needs because you don't know her. You've never tried to know her just like you never knew me.,1
EMILY,Oh I know you.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, please. You don't know anything about me.",1
EMILY,"Oh, you'd like to think that, wouldn't you? That you're just some huge mystery to me. 'Why does Lorelai do that?' 'I don't know, she's a mystery to me.' Well you're not so mysterious, Lorelai.",1
LORELAI,No! No! What am I then?,1
EMILY,Well right now you're very loud and disruptive to the entire cleaning process. For God's sake! What do I have to do to get you to put the damn cheese in individual bags?,1
LORELAI,"Fine, I give up",1
EMILY,"Oh, you give up? If I had a dollar for every time you gave up --",1
LORELAI,"Then you could pay for this party, couldn't you?",1
SOOKIE,I made coffee.,1
LORELAI,Mmm.,1
SOOKIE,Hangover?,1
LORELAI,Emily.,1
SOOKIE,Oh. Got it. Moving on...,1
RORY,Good morning.,1
SOOKIE,"Morning, Popcorn. You want some pancakes?",1
RORY,"No, I've gotta get going.",1
LORELAI,Where?,1
RORY,The college fair is this morning.,1
LORELAI,So you're going to get yet another Harvard brochure?,1
RORY,I just want to see if they've changed the pictures.,1
LORELAI,Weirdo.,1
RORY,I'll be back in plenty of time to help you decorate.,1
LORELAI,"No, this is your party. You do not work. You lounge and mock those who are. Have I taught you nothing?",1
RORY,Sorry. I'll try to be better. Bye.,1
SOOKIE,"OK, bye-bye.",1
RORY,New brochure? HARVARD,1
REP,Yes.,1
PARIS,What are you doing here?,1
RORY,There's a college fair going on.,1
PARIS,"No, I mean, what are you doing here?",1
RORY,I'm getting a new brochure.,1
PARIS,Why?,1
RORY,Because they're not selling pizza. Oh no.,1
PARIS,You can't.,1
RORY,You're applying to Harvard?,1
PARIS,Yes.,1
RORY,No!,1
PARIS,Ten generations of Gellers have gone to Harvard. I have to go to Harvard.,1
RORY,I can't believe this.,1
PARIS,You can go somewhere else. Go to Brandeis. Brandeis is nice.,1
RORY,I've only ever wanted to go to Harvard. That's it. Nowhere else. It's a big school.,1
PARIS,I guess.,1
RORY,We'll probably never see each other.,1
PARIS,You think?,1
RORY,"And if we do, we duck.",1
PARIS,OK. So...,1
PARIS,Hey...Are you dating Tristin?,1
RORY,What? No. No way.,1
PARIS,Do you like him?,1
RORY,Not even a little.,1
PARIS,Really?,1
RORY,Really.,1
PARIS,OK.,1
PARIS,Hey...Nice party.,1
RORY,,1
PATTY,Happy birthday Rory!,1
LORELAI,"Open it, open it, open it!",1
RORY,No!,1
LORELAI,You like it? You can take it back.,1
RORY,No! I love it! It's perfect.,1
LORELAI,It's blue and it has a handle.,1
RORY,It's way too expensive.,1
LORELAI,"I know, that's what I told the guy at the store.",1
SOOKIE,"OK! On three 'cause I'm gonna drop it. OK, One, two --",1
LORELAI,Make a wish.,1
LORELAI,"All right, everybody, I need your attention, your attention please. This is a very serious moment. Two priests, a rabbi and a duck --",1
RORY,Mom.,1
LORELAI,"All right, I'm kidding. Um, I would like to propose a toast to the one thing in my life that is always good, always sweet, and without whom I would have no reason to get up in the morning. My pal Rory. Cheers.",1
BABETTE,Happy birthday.,1
LORELAI,And in honor of this very special girl I now invite you all to help me eat her face.,1
SOOKIE,And you may have the first cut.,1
RORY,There's something very strange about hacking into my own head.,1
LORELAI,"Jeez, who the hell's ringing the bell? It's a party! Get your ass in here!",1
LORELAI,Or asses I guess.,1
RORY,"Grandma! Grandpa! I can't believe you're here. I'm so glad you came. Hey, no tie?",1
RICHARD,I thought I'd mix it up a little.,1
RORY,"Grandma, look.",1
EMILY,"Why, it looks lovely.",1
RORY,"I want you to meet everyone. Everyone, these are my grandparents.",1
EVERYONE,Hi.,1
RICHARD,Hello.,1
EMILY,Lorelai.,1
LORELAI,"Emily, Dad.",1
RICHARD,,1
PATTY,I'm Patricia LaCosta. We just love your daughter and granddaughter.,1
EMILY,,1
PATTY,"My God, you're a tall speciman of a man. Must be all that good air in Hartford.",1
LORELAI,"Mom, Dad, can I get you a drink?",1
EMILY,"No, thank you.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, no, Mom, you're going to need one and I have wine glasses that say ""Holiday Inn"" on them.",1
EMILY,Stoli on the rocks with a twist.,1
LORELAI,Right.,1
LORELAI,"Um, OK, uh, my parents are here.",1
SOOKIE,No!,1
LORELAI,"Yeah. I've cursed in front of them twice and Miss Patty already tried to hit on my dad, and I'm sure my mom is going to call Child Protective Services",1
SOOKIE,"God, when was the last time they were here?",1
LORELAI,Never.,1
SOOKIE,Not once?,1
LORELAI,"Not since we moved here. I mean, they'd come down and visit is occasionally when Rory was a baby and we lived at the inn, but they have never been here.",1
SOOKIE,Wow. That's big stuff. Is Rory thrilled?,1
LORELAI,Through the roof.,1
SOOKIE,"Oh, that's great.",1
EMILY,"Lorelai, I just tried some of thse hors d'ouevres. They're unbelievable. Who is your caterer?",1
LORELAI,Sookie.,1
EMILY,What's a Sookie?,1
LORELAI,That's a Sookie.,1
SOOKIE,Hi. Sookie St. James.,1
LORELAI,"Sookie's the chef at the inn, Mom.",1
EMILY,"My dear, you are very talented.",1
SOOKIE,Thank you.,1
EMILY,"Well, you must cater my next party. When my friends get wind of you you're going to have so much business you won't know what to do with yourself. But remember -- I discovered you.",1
LORELAI,"Mom, Sookie has a job. She's the chef at the inn. The inn where we work -- my inn. Sixdays a week, Mom. Just give her your number or we'll never get out of here.",1
SOOKIE,OK.,1
LORELAI,"So, how does it look?",1
RICHARD,"Well, it doesn't look structurally sound.",1
LORELAI,"Drink up, Dad.",1
SOOKIE,"OK, don't panic.",1
LORELAI,Good opening line. What's wrong?,1
SOOKIE,We're out of ice.,1
LORELAI,How could we be out of ice? We had a ton of ice. It was like a penguin habitat in there.,1
SOOKIE,"I don't know how it happened, I just know it happened and somehow we have to deal with it.",1
LORELAI,I will go and get some then.,1
LORELAI,"Oh! Oh my God! You're a vision! Sookie, we have ice!",1
SOOKIE,Hallelujah.,1
LORELAI,How did you know?,1
LUKE,"Well, a good rule of thumb is you can never have too much ice.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, you're the best.",1
LORELAI,"That's -- Oh, hi, Mom. This is my friend Luke",1
LUKE,How are you doing?,1
EMILY,"Fine, thank you.",1
LUKE,Well I'd better get these in the freezer before they melts.,1
LORELAI,"Well, not very likely in here.",1
RORY,Grandpa?,1
RICHARD,"Rory, what a lovely party.",1
RORY,I brought you something to read.,1
RICHARD,Oh.,1
RORY,"It's not the Wall Street Journal, but there's a quiz in there that determines whether you're a summer or a fall.",1
RICHARD,"Well I appreciate this, thank you.",1
BABETTE,"Oh, Morey, you rememb er the time that Rory decided that our old tree stump was a fairy ring?",1
MOREY,I sure do.,1
BABETTE,"How old was she then, sugar?",1
LORELAI,I think she was about 10.,1
RORY,"Hey, all I know is that it matched the description .",1
BABETTE,"Oh, God, she was cute. She used to sit out there with a peanut butter sandwich just waiting for the fairy to get hungry.",1
RORY,,1
PATTY,I'm still crushed beyond belief that she quit her ballet lessons.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, not me. Miss Perfect Work Ethic would prance around this room 24 hours a day.",1
RORY,And I still stunk.,1
LANE,,1
PATTY,That's not true!,1
MOREY,,1
PATTY,,1
PATTY,What? She did. She was talented.,1
LORELAI,I made that.,1
EMILY,Really?,1
LORELAI,From Rory's old baby clothes,1
EMILY,How nice. Hope you washed them first.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, rats. I knew I forgot something.",1
EMILY,That's quite an assortment of characters you've assembled down there.,1
LORELAI,They're great people.,1
EMILY,This Patricia --,1
LORELAI,Miss Patty.,1
EMILY,She teaches dance?,1
LORELAI,Among other things.,1
EMILY,And this man with the ice.,1
LORELAI,Luke.,1
EMILY,How long have you been seeing him?,1
LORELAI,Luke? I'm not seeing Luke. He's just a friend.,1
EMILY,Mm-hmm.,1
LORELAI,"Mom, I swear. Luke keeps me in coffee, nothing else.",1
EMILY,He seems to like you.,1
LORELAI,And you're judging this by what?,1
EMILY,By they way he looked at you.,1
LORELAI,Which is how?,1
EMILY,Like you were about to give him a lap dance.,1
LORELAI,"Mom, he did not look at me like that.",1
EMILY,You're pleased.,1
LORELAI,What?,1
EMILY,You smiled. You're pleased that the ice man looked at you like a Porterhouse steak.,1
LORELAI,I'm smiling because you're crazy and that's what you do to crazy people to keep them calm.,1
EMILY,What's this?,1
LORELAI,"Well, that's me, Mom.",1
EMILY,I know that's you. You're wearing a cast.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, that's when I broke my leg.",1
EMILY,You broke your leg?,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, three years ago during a yoga class. The headstand portion took a very ugly turn. The good thing was I brought the smug, blonde, pretzel chick down with me. I've since learned that I'm a bit too comptetitive for yoga.",1
EMILY,I never knew that you broke your leg.,1
LORELAI,"It was no big deal, Mom. If I'd been really sick you would have known.",1
EMILY,"Yeah, well...You know, could get a maid in here once a week to at least tidy the place up.",1
LORELAI,I like it cluttered.,1
EMILY,You can't even find the bed.,1
LORELAI,Yes I can. It's the thing that I crash into on the way to the closet.,1
EMILY,I should go check on your father.,1
LORELAI,"It was nice that you came tonight, Mom. It meant a lot. To Rory. Really.",1
EMILY,"Well, she is my granddaughter, after all. I should be here.",1
LORELAI,I totally agree.,1
LORELAI,Leave it.,1
EMILY,It's time to go now.,1
RICHARD,"In a minute, please.",1
EMILY,"Rory, we're going to get going now.",1
RORY,Thank you for coming.,1
EMILY,Thanks for asking me.,1
RICHARD,"Ah, lovely party. I enjoyed the reading material immensely.",1
RORY,So what's the verdict?,1
RICHARD,I am an autumn.,1
RORY,Interesting.,1
RICHARD,Isn't it?,1
LORELAI,"Hey, so you guys leaving? The mud wrestling starts in ten minutes.",1
EMILY,"Good night, Lorelai. We had a lovely time.",1
LORELAI,And with a straight face you said that.,1
RICHARD,I'd have that chimney inspected if I were you.,1
LORELAI,"I'll get right on that, Dad.",1
RICHARD,For Fez.,1
RORY,"But Grandpa, you already took care of that.",1
RICHARD,Fez is a very large city.,1
RORY,So...,1
LORELAI,Food fight?,1
RORY,Absolutely.,1
RICHARD,Emily?,1
EMILY,She's right. I don't know my daughter at all. We should go. Traffic.,1
LORELAI,"Next year, we are going to a McDonald's with one of those slides and that's it.",1
SOOKIE,The party was a hit.,1
LORELAI,And we'll be eating onion dip for breakfast for a week.,1
SOOKIE,"You know, you mix that dip with some groud turkey and some garlic and it's really not too bad.",1
LORELAI,"Hey, I'm not looking for a recipe.",1
SOOKIE,"Ooh, reflex, sorry. OK, I'm gonna go check the living room.",1
LORELAI,OK.,1
RORY,You didn't have to get me an ything.,1
DEAN,"Sorry, that's the rules. You get older, you get a gift.",1
RORY,,1
DEAN,That's OK. This is better.,1
RORY,Oh my God. It's beautiful.,1
DEAN,"Well, I bought the medallion and I just cut some leather straps and drilled a hole, and well, you like it?",1
RORY,I -- it's amazing.,1
DEAN,Good.,1
RORY,Thank you.,1
DEAN,,1

LORELAI,So where'd you say Dad was?,1
EMILY,Away on business.,1
LORELAI,Location's top secret?,1
EMILY,"Oh, Germany.",1
LORELAI,Germany. Is Dad's firm insuring Nazis now?,1
EMILY,Your father doesn't know any Nazis.,1
LORELAI,"I know, Mom. I was just --",1
EMILY,What?,1
RORY,Joking. She was joking.,1
EMILY,Oh. Hard to tell.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, well.",1
EMILY,"Oh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Claudia died.",1
LORELAI,Who?,1
EMILY,Claudia. Your cousin Claudia. Claudia!,1
LORELAI,"I'm hearing the name, Mom. I have no idea who that is.",1
EMILY,"Claudia's your cousin, for all intents and purposes.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, now we're getting to it.",1
EMILY,"She was your father's grandmother's sister's girl. So to you, that would make her --",1
LORELAI,Nothing?,1
EMILY,Regardless the funeral's on Thursday. I thought we'd all go together.,1
LORELAI,"Ooh, whoa. Two problems. Impossible to get away from the inn Thursday. Two, I've never met this woman.",1
Posted,11/21/00 00:21,1
EMILY,You most certainly have.,1
LORELAI,When?,1
EMILY,Several times.,1
LORELAI,I'll take one.,1
EMILY,We went to her house in Groton to see the first moon landing. She'd just gotten a new Philco.,1
LORELAI,I have no memo ry of this whatsoever.,1
EMILY,"Rory, correct me if I'm wrong, but men have walked on the moon regardless of whether your mother rememb ers it or not.",1
RORY,That's the rumor.,1
LORELAI,I know men have walked on the moon. I just don't know Claudia.,1
EMILY,So you're not going?,1
LORELAI,Not this time.,1
EMILY,I don't think Claudia's planning to die a second time.,1
LORELAI,"Mom, I couldn't go if I wanted to.",1
EMILY,Fine. Oh wait -- Rudolph Gottfried.,1
LORELAI,Another cousin?,1
EMILY,"No, a n*zi that we knew. I'd forgotten. We stayed with him once in Munich. Nice old man. Interesting stories.",1
LORELAI,Mom you socialized with a n*zi? That's despicable! That's heinous!,1
EMILY,"No, dear, that was a joke.",1
LORELAI,Hey. I have an idea for a new reality show. How about everyone just looks out their freakin' kitchen window for a change?,1
RORY,Ooh. She's cranky this morning.,1
LORELAI,Let's just say the world has a formidable opponent.,1
RORY,Wait -- shouldn't you be baking?,1
LORELAI,I don't know. Shouldn't you be knitting?,1
RORY,Mom! The Chilton bake sale is today!,1
LORELAI,I know. I got it covered.,1
RORY,They expect the things to be homemade.,1
LORELAI,I know.,1
RORY,By someone other than Dolly Madison.,1
LORELAI,I said I have it covered.,1
RORY,"All of the parents pitch in so this is really really important. You know that, right?",1
LORELAI,"No, I didn't know that. In that case I don't have it covered. I have it covered! Get your stuff and hit the stereo -- we're late.",1
RORY,It's not me.,1
LORELAI,Where does your mother think you are?,1
LANE,"Oh, on a park bench contemplating the reunification of the two Koreas.",1
LORELAI,"Not here, skanking to Rancid?",1
LANE,Wouldn't be included.,1
LORELAI,School!,1
LANE,Bye.,1
RORY,Bye.,1
RORY,"Wow, Cinnamon, riding in style.",1
BABETTE,"Yeah, Morey made it. Cinnamon's not walking good these days but she still likes her passeggiatas. That's Italian for 'a nice walk.'",1
MOREY,Passeggiata.,1
BABETTE,"Oh God, he makes it sound so sexy.",1
MOREY,Come on.,1
LORELAI,What's that?,1
BABETTE,"Oh it's Cinnamon's private area. Sometimes she likes to be alone. She's just like Morey in that sense. Hey, say passaggiata again.",1
MOREY,"I can't do it on comman d, Babs.",1
BABETTE,"Oh, he's blushin'. God, I love a man that blushes!",1
RORY,"Okay, our town is just weird.",1
LORELAI,Thank God.,1
RORY,Bye.,1
LORELAI,Bye.,1
RORY,I'll see you later at school.,1
LORELAI,For what?,1
RORY,"Mom, the bake sale!",1
LORELAI,Ha! I got the vein in the forehead. Whoo!,1
RORY,Sadist.,1
DEAN,Hey.,1
RORY,Aah! Morning.,1
DEAN,Good book?,1
RORY,I don't know yet.,1
DEAN,I saw you standing in line so I thought I'd say hello. Hello?,1
RORY,Hello.,1
DEAN,"Oh, hey, uh, thanks for helping me get the job at the store. I mean it's not a career or anything but it's got me solvent.",1
RORY,Solvent's good.,1
DEAN,"Yeah, uh, are you always this serious?",1
RORY,No.,1
DEAN,"So, uh, how long does it take you to get to school?",1
RORY,"Um...forty minutes if the bus driver's focused but longer if he's trying to win something onthe radio. Hey, this bus is going to Hartford!",1
DEAN,"Yeah, I know.",1
RORY,"But you go to school here. You have to get off the bus! Hey, he has to get off the bus!",1
DEAN,Wait. You're forgetting something.,1
DEAN,Buses make stops. Good-bye Lorelai Gilmore.,1
MICHELorelai,"Independence Inn, Michel speaking. Yes, you are confirmed. Mm-hmm. Goodbye.",1
MAN,Bonjour Monsieur. Vous êtes francais? Vous parlez francais?,1
MICHELorelai,"No, sorry.",1
MAN,Parlez vous fracais?,1
MICHELorelai,"Sir, I'm just a simple country boy from Texas. I do not understand this francais business you're babbling about.",1
LORELAI,Pardon,1
LORELAI,He knows you're not from Texas.,1
MICHELorelai,Smile when you say that.,1
LORELAI,"Michel, I told you there was going to be a French group here for a couple of days and it is your job to keep them happy.",1
MICHELorelai,"Lorelai, I don't know how many French people you've met over the years, but most of them are insufferable.",1
LORELAI,Really?,1
MICHELorelai,Mm-hm. That is why I left France.,1
LORELAI,"Huh. I thought it had something to do with the torches and the villagers. Michel, talk to them.",1
MICHELorelai,"Never. You are giving me that look aren't you? Your patented, ""Do it or something unspeakable shall befall you"" look. Fine. I shall be French but I shall not be happy.",1
LORELAI,Then you will be yourself. Good choice.,1
MICHELorelai,Bonjour messieurs. Je m'appelle Miche. Ce soir pour vous aider.,1
MAN,Vous avez faîtt un blague. Très drole! Très drole Michel!,1
MICHELorelai,k*ll me now.,1
SOOKIE,"OK-- we've got our French fantasies, American treats, and our Italian taste sensations. Well, what do you think?",1
RORY,Amazing.,1
LORELAI,Incredible.,1
SOOKIE,"It is good, isn't it? Well, final touch.",1
RORY,"Oh, can I do that?",1
SOOKIE,"Whoa, honey, this is a more delicate procedure than you might think, OK?",1
RORY,OK.,1
SOOKIE,It takes an expert hand. (SOOKIE lights the tablecloth on fire. Lorelai fills a cup with lemondae from a nearby table and extinguishes the flames. The women at the lemonade table give her dirty looks.,1
LORELAI,"Um -- hi. Oh, well, gee...what is that, a dollar? Let me find you a dollar. You know what? I'll take two -- I'll drink one. Mmm...tasty and flame-retardant. MR.",1
MEDINA,Very Henry the Eighth.,1
LORELAI,Well we're not into subtle. MR.,1
MEDINA,"Good to see you, Lorelai.",1
LORELAI,"Good to see you, Mr. Medina. MR.",1
MEDINA,Max.,1
LORELAI,Mr. Medina. MR.,1
MEDINA,Max.,1
LORELAI,"Mr. Medina. Meet Sookie, the cheft at the inn. Sookie, Mr. Medina.",1
SOOKIE,What's your name ag ain?,1
LORELAI,Mr. Medina.,1
SOOKIE,"I know, you've said it like a zillion times. Hello. MR.",1
MEDINA,"Hello. Lorelai, could I borrow you for a second?",1
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, sure. Oh! Hey I'll be right back. MR.",1
MEDINA,"You know, Lorelai, I would love for the ice to thaw.",1
LORELAI,There's no ice. MR.,1
MEDINA,Well you repeated my full name four times. That's ice.,1
LORELAI,"No, that's not ice, it's wintry. MR.",1
MEDINA,I was doing my job when I didn't let Rory take that test. I didn't like it but I had to do it.,1
LORELAI,I know. MR.,1
MEDINA,And I'd do it again.,1
LORELAI,OK. MR.,1
MEDINA,I really do think Rory's a great kid and I'm going to do my damnedest to make sure she gets through Chilton in one piece.,1
LORELAI,I appreciate that. MR.,1
MEDINA,And I'd like us to be friends.,1
LORELAI,We are. Me too. MR.,1
MEDINA,Yeah?,1
LORELAI,"Yeah. Really, truly, I swear. There's no more ice. We're walking in a pool of tepid water. MR.",1
MEDINA,Good.,1
LORELAI,Good. MR.,1
MEDINA,I'm going to propose something here. I'm not sure how you're going to take it.,1
LORELAI,"Oh wow, intrigue. MR.",1
MEDINA,"I'd like to see you sometime. Away from the ivy, away from the gargoyles, away from here.",1
LORELAI,Are you asking me out on a date. MR.,1
MEDINA,Yes.,1
LORELAI,"Mm. Well, uh, I don't want to go out on a limb here, but I'm guessing if the headmaster won't let a kid be thirty seconds late for a test he'd probably frown on a teacher dating a mom.MR.",1
MEDINA,"I do my job well, I'm dedicated to my students, and there's nothing in the Chilton book of ethics that prohibits it.",1
LORELAI,Yeah but I'm guessing it's sort of an unwritten rule. MR.,1
MEDINA,Do you want to go?,1
LORELAI,And Rory would probably freak at the thought. MR.,1
MEDINA,Do you want to go?,1
LORELAI,And the other parents would have a field day with this kind of thing. MR.,1
MEDINA,Do you want to go?,1
LORELAI,Yes. MR.,1
MEDINA,Good.,1
LORELAI,Wait. MR.,1
MEDINA,What?,1
LORELAI,No. MR.,1
MEDINA,Why?,1
LORELAI,I can't. It's wrong. It's weird. MR.,1
MEDINA,I'll pay.,1
LORELAI,You're on. MR.,1
MEDINA,Really?,1
LORELAI,I'm kidding. I don't know. You're Rory's teacher. MR.,1
MEDINA,I know.,1
LORELAI,"Could you quit? Right, that's crazy. MR.",1
MEDINA,"OK, OK. Um...how about coffee? You like coffee?",1
LORELAI,Only with my oxygen. MR.,1
MEDINA,"Can we drink some together? A sort of pre-date. Very casual, no strings, no obligations. We'll just see if it's even worth going down the road of including food in the deal. Just coffee. Decaf? There's nothing safer than decaf.",1
LORELAI,"I'm going to be in town tomorrow because I take a class at Hartford State and there's a coffee shop across the street that I sometimes, almost all the time, go to around 4:00 and usually exactly 4:12. I could not stop a person from entering said establishment around that time, nor would I avoid them if I knew them if they did. MR.",1
MEDINA,You know the wordsmith thing -- that's something we have in common.,1
LORELAI,"See you around, Max. MR.",1
MEDINA,Indeed. You will.,1
LANE,Philadelphia.,1
RORY,Philadelphia? If you could live in any city in the world you'd pick Philadelphia?,1
LANE,M. Night Shymalan lives there.,1
RORY,Who?,1
LANE,The guy who directed 'The Sixth Sense.',1
RORY,But what would you do there?,1
LANE,Hang out with M. Night Shymalan.,1
RORY,"OK, cross 'guidance counselor' off your list of potential career choices.",1
BABETTE,"Lie still, baby doll, we're almost home.",1
RORY,Hey Babette.,1
BABETTE,Hey kids.,1
RORY,"Wow, that sounds bad.",1
BABETTE,Cinnamon's dyspeptic. So's Morey. Too many clams.,1
MOREY,Bad clams.,1
BABETTE,This doesn't reflect well on Al's establishment.,1
LANE,You had clams at Al's?,1
RORY,Al's Pancake World?,1
BABETTE,"Yeah, well we had a coupon.",1
RORY,Hmmm.,1
RORY,"Oh wow! The store! Hey, listen, I have to pick up some stuff, so --",1

RORY,Just some...stuff. So I'll talk to you later tonight.,1
LANE,I'll go in with you.,1
RORY,Why?,1
LANE,Because otherwise I'd have to go home.,1
RORY,Home is good.,1
LANE,My home?,1
RORY,"Yeah, actually I don't have to go in.",1
LANE,OK. Then I guess I will go home.,1
RORY,"Great! Go, bye.",1
LANE,,1

RORY,,1
PATTY,"Oh, I see what you're here for. Well that wouldn't fit in a basket. No no no no no!",1
RORY,,1

PATTY,"Oh, my favorite kind.",1

RORY,,1

RORY,,1
PATTY,You're welcome.,1
EMPLOYEE,,1
PATTY,"Please, honey, don't call me ma'am. It makes me feel older than 25. Here, have a pea pod.",1
EMPLOYEE,,1
PATTY,"Oh, so brusque. And you are?",1
EMPLOYEE,,1
PATTY,"Well listen here, my fine friend, who if you had a better hairstyle i might consider dating, I do this all the time.",1
EMPLOYEE,,1
PATTY,"Oh, now, wait a minute here. I've been sampling food at this establishment for years.",1
EMPLOYEE,"The next time you put something in that mouth that doesn't belong there, I'm going to remove it and then call the police.",1
CASHIERory,"Is this all you want, honey? A head of lettuce and a mouse trap?",1
RORY,That should do it.,1
DEAN,That's a couple of must-need items there.,1
CASHIERory,$2.27.,1
RORY,I only have a dollar.,1
DEAN,I could loan you the rest.,1
RORY,"Uh, no, I'll just take the lettuce.",1
DEAN,Perfect. You could use half of it for a salad then use the other half to clobber the mouse with.,1
DEAN,Paper or plastic?,1
RORY,I'm fine. MR.,1
MEDINA,Lorelai?,1
LORELAI,Max! Hi! MR.,1
MEDINA,"Small world, huh?",1
LORELAI,Absolutely! What are you drinking? MR.,1
MEDINA,Coffee.,1
LORELAI,Plain coffee? MR.,1
MEDINA,"I wanted some cream but that prompted a very elaborate foam conversation. And the look of disapproval I got when I said I didn't want foam, just cream, rivaled the one I got from my dad when I told him I wanted to be a teacher.",1
LORELAI,"Wow, so it's been a tough outing for you, huh? MR.",1
MEDINA,Well it's getting better.,1
WAITRESS,What can I get you?,1
LORELAI,"Coffee, please. MR.",1
MEDINA,"So, here we are.",1
LORELAI,Here we most certainly are. MR.,1
MEDINA,Running into each other.,1
LORELAI,Away from the school. MR.,1
MEDINA,And its unique strictures.,1
LORELAI,These things do happen. MR.,1
MEDINA,Fate can be funny.,1
LORELAI,Should we cut the cute and just get right to it? MR.,1
MEDINA,I think we should date.,1
LORELAI,Why? MR.,1
MEDINA,Because I think we both want to.,1
LORELAI,"Well I want to be in the Bangles but that doesn't mean I quit my job and get a guitar andruin my life to be a Bangle, does it? MR.",1
MEDINA,The Bangles broke up.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, that's not the point. MR.",1
MEDINA,Well it's got to be part of the point if there's no band anymore.,1
LORELAI,I repeat my,1
question,'why should we date?' MR.,1
MEDINA,Because we're clearly attracted to each other.,1
LORELAI,I'm attracted to pie. It doesn't mean I feel the need to date pie. MR.,1
MEDINA,OK then because we are --,1
LORELAI,Yes? MR.,1
MEDINA,-- of similar heights.,1
LORELAI,Wow! Round one and already tapped. MR.,1
MEDINA,Look I know that you are concerned about the appearance of us dating.,1
LORELAI,Yes I am. MR.,1
MEDINA,Well I can tell you that I am the soul of discretion when it comes to delicate relationships.,1
LORELAI,"Dated a lot of Chilton moms, huh? MR.",1
MEDINA,"No, I meant any relationships -- work, family.",1
LORELAI,Oh so you have things to hide in all aspects of your life -- very interesting. MR.,1
MEDINA,"Do you have any hemlock back there? Arsenic, something quick?",1

LORELAI,Me too. You just telling me w hat I want to hear? MR.,1
MEDINA,Yeah.,1
LORELAI,I knew it! MR.,1
MEDINA,Doesn't mean it doesn't coincide with how I really feel.,1
LORELAI,Yeah but if you're telling me wh at you think I want to hear then I'm not really getting to know you.MR.,1
MEDINA,And if I know what you want to hear that shows a level of understanding on my part that far exceeds your understanding of me. . Who's the one laggin?,1
LORELAI,Uh... MR.,1
MEDINA,"Wow, round one and already tapped!",1
LORELAI,"Rory is my life. She's my pal, my everything. And I would never, ever do anything that would hurt her. MR.",1
MEDINA,I understand. But Rory is not a baby anymore.,1
LORELAI,Don't say that! She's eight! She's eight and her favorite hobby is making necklaces out of gum wrappers. MR.,1
MEDINA,"You could try stunting her growth, keeping her in a box, blowing cigarette smoke on her. MR.",1
MEDINA,You are so taking this out of context. MR.,1
MEDINA,"OK, when my uncle was a young man, there was this girl who lived across the street from him and he was completely in love with her -- but he never talked to her. But he knew in his gut that this was the girl he wanted to spend the rest of his life with.",1
LORELAI,This is gonna be sad isn't it? MR.,1
MEDINA,Let me finish.,1
LORELAI,It's gonna be sad. MR.,1
MEDINA,"So anyhow my uncle watches this girl, waiting for the right moment to approach her. Next thing he knows, he gets drafted.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, going for Kleenex. MR.",1
MEDINA,"No. Now he thinks 'this is perfect. I'll come back, I'll have a career, I'll have served my country, I'll be worthy of her love.' When he gets back -- she's gone. Moved away. No one knew where and he never saw that girl again. Now my uncle, he didn't say much to me, but the one thing he did say was that if there's something in your gut that you know you feel is right you gotta go after it, no matter what. What do you say?",1
LORELAI,Maybe dinner wouldn't be so bad. MR.,1
MEDINA,Dinner? You mean we could sit together? Even drive together?,1
LORELAI,Just take the card.MR.,1
MEDINA,I might frame the card.,1
LORELAI,Just use the card. MR.,1
MEDINA,I definitely will.,1
LORELAI,"Hey, that story about your uncle -- is that true? MR.",1
MEDINA,Goodbye Lorelai Gilmore.,1
SOOKIE,Thank you.,1
LORELAI,"Thank you. Life is a funny funny thing, huh?",1
SOOKIE,Yeah I love that Jim Car rey.,1
LORELAI,What?,1
SOOKIE,Jim Car rey. He's just -- he's just -- funny.,1
LORELAI,"He is funny but I didn't mean funny, funny. I'm being philosophical.",1
SOOKIE,Oh. Very serious face. Jean-Paul Sartre.,1
LORELAI,I can't talk to you with that face.,1
LUKE,How do you guys get any work done?,1
SOOKIE,So why is life such a funy thing?,1
LORELAI,I met this amazing guy.,1
SOOKIE,Goody!,1
LORELAI,Yeah there's goody stuff about it but there's baddy stuff too. He's a teacher at Chilton. Max -- you met him at the bake sale.,1
SOOKIE,Oh! He looked good.,1
LORELAI,Yeah. Right. He's so sexy and smart and funny and he likes coffee.,1
SOOKIE,"God, he sounds perfect for you. Did you get onions?",1
LORELAI,No.,1
SOOKIE,Hey Luke! You forgot the onions.,1
LORELAI,I'm just so mixed up though. You know this is a real crossroads kind of situation.It's like 'to perm or not to perm.' I'm really confused.,1
SOOKIE,For Heaven's sake.,1
SOOKIE,"Go ahead, I'm still listening. You were about to perm your hair.",1
LORELAI,I just want to do the right thing.,1
SOOKIE,I'm not sure I see what the problem is.,1
LORELAI,"Oh there are many problems. First -- I do not like to involve Rory in my personal life. I don't want her to have to deal with that. You know, I might bring some guy home and he might not be THE guy but then she gets all attached to him and then all of a sudden I decide that I don't like the way he eats or he hums incessantly or --",1
SOOKIE,Or the way he smacks his lips or how his hair isn't really his.,1
LORELAI,Yeah. And then I break up with him and then Rory is the one who gets hurt.,1
SOOKIE,I totally understand.,1
LORELAI,"This guy is her teacher. I mean, there's no way to keep him out of her life. She sees him every day.",1
SOOKIE,Are you the open-faced turkey? BEARDED,1
CUSTOMERory,Yep.,1
SOOKIE,"OK, I added a little fresh lemon and a little cayanne pepper. You're gonna plotz! You od know that Rory's not a baby anymore.",1
LORELAI,"I know, that's what he said. Maybe I'm being too serious, right? Maybe I should loosen the rules a bit. Plus, be great to get...you know.",1
SOOKIE,What?,1
LORELAI,You know.,1
SOOKIE,No I don't.,1
LORELAI,You know...he knows.,1
SOOKIE,You know? BEARDED,1
CUSTOMERory,Yeah I know.,1
LUKE,Sookie!,1
SOOKIE,Hey. I was just looking for your paprika.,1
LUKE,What have I said about the counter?,1
SOOKIE,I know.,1
LUKE,"How the counter is a sacred space. MY sacred space. You don't do yoga on the Dalai Lama's mat and you don't come behind my counter, period.Luke takes Sookie by the shoulders and walks her back to the other side of the counter.)",1
SOOKIE,I was trying to help.,1
LUKE,You bring her again and I want her on a leash. I mean it.,1
SOOKIE,He does make a damn find burger though.,1
LORELAI,He does at that. Alright I'm just going to keep it simple. I'll tell Rory. If there's even an ounce of weirdenss about it I'll cancel.,1
SOOKIE,You haven't told Rory yet?,1
LORELAI,No.,1
SOOKIE,Oops.,1
LORELAI,"No, not oops. The timing hasn't been right. This is a very delicate, fragile situation. It's like one of your souffles. If you don't do it right it's a disaster.",1
SOOKIE,And you have to order it 45 minutes in advance.,1
LORELAI,Huh?,1
SOOKIE,My souffle.,1
LORELAI,"Right, I wasn't but speaking directly about your souffle. I was speaking metaphorically.",1
SOOKIE,Oh so you don't like my souffles?,1
LORELAI,How DO we work together?,1
RORY,Mom you better come.,1
LORELAI,"Honey, what's wrong?",1
RORY,It's Cinnamon.,1
LORELAI,Babette? Honey?,1
BABETTE,"Oh, Lorelai. Come in , come in . She's gone. Cinnamon's gone.",1
LORELAI,I'm so sorry.,1
RORY,"Is there anything I can do for you, Morey?",1
MOREY,"This is life, Rory, it breaks your heart.",1
BABETTE,"She looked like she was sleeping. I thought she was asleep so I nudged her and she didn't wake. I gave her a push and she rolled off the couch and since I waxed the floor she went sh**t' across the room and then she knocked over the lamp and she still didn't move. I knew it was over. Oh, God, my baby.",1
MOREY,Tell me it wasn't the --,1
BABETTE,"Oh, Morey, don't do this to yourself. He thinks it was the clams.",1
MOREY,"She saw me eat ing them and she gave me that 'hey, man, what's up?' look and --",1
VET,"It wasn't the clams. Morey, in human years this cat was 260 years old.",1
LORELAI,"That's a good, long life.",1
VET,"Listen, why don't you let me take her out to the van and then I'll get out of your way.",1
BABETTE,"Oh, no, stay. All of you, please stay. Cinnamon would want you here.",1
RORY,We'll stay as long as you want.,1
MOREY,I'll never eat clams again.,1
RORY,Me either.,1
LANE,They said that they rolled her body into a lamp.,1
LANE,Did you laugh?,1
LANE,Did you want to?,1
RORY,But it's sad.,1
LANE,"Yeah, it's sad.",1
MICHELorelai,"Hello? Hello? Where is Lorelai? I'm dropping something off. Yoo-hoo, 'Hee-Haw' man, where is Lorelai Gilmore?",1
LORELAI,"Hey, hey, hey. Thank you. I could not get back to the inn.",1
MICHELorelai,"What, you are having a party and I was not invited?",1
LORELAI,"Sweetie, it's not a party, it's a wake.",1
MICHELorelai,"Oh, really? Who died?",1
LORELAI,Their cat.,1
MICHELorelai,You are mourning a cat?,1
LORELAI,Yes.,1
MICHELorelai,"They lick their privates, these cats.",1
LORELAI,,1
PATTY,"Babette, Morey, I came as soon as I heard. Oh, darling, what do you need?",1
BABETTE,,1
PATTY,Oh -- oh!,1
SOOKIE,"Oh, Luke.",1
LUKE,Sookie.,1
SOOKIE,What'cha got in the bag?,1
LUKE,Bricks.,1
SOOKIE,"Yeah, good one.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, bless you both! Everyone's starved, come in.",1
LORELAI,"OK, how should we do this?",1
SOOKIE,"Well we need a flow for the room so there's no bottlenecks. People coming in, they're gonna want a beverage. Put 'em on the first table then the smaller hors d'oeuvres next to that, leaving one hand free to greet the people. Then, back there, set up plates and cutlery. First the salads, then the meat dishes, then desserts on the piano bench. How does that sound? Luke dumps his bags of food on a table in the middle of the room.)",1
LUKE,Dig in!,1
DEAN,"Oh, hi, wow. I wasn't expecting you.",1
RORY,"Or me you. I mean, you, me. I mean, come in.",1

MEDINA,The neighbors' --,1
LORELAI,-- cat. She died. MR.,1
MEDINA,She died.,1
LORELAI,"This was a very fat, very beloved cat. MR.",1
MEDINA,Lorelai. I like you but I don't want to force something on you that you don't want so --,1
LORELAI,"No, no, no. Wait. No, Max, you're not forcing anything on me. I am telling the truth about the cat. MR.",1
MEDINA,Lorelai.,1
LORELAI,Please don't read that much into this. Call me and we'll reschedule. I promise that's what I want. MR.,1
MEDINA,You're sure?,1
LORELAI,Cross my heart and hope no other neighborhood pets die on that day. MR.,1
MEDINA,"OK, I'll call.",1

LUKE,You gonna make fun of my mother too?,1

EMPLOYEE,,1
PATTY,Well if it isn't Kirk the jerk.,1
EMPLOYEE,,1
PATTY,I'm listening.,1
EMPLOYEE,,1
PATTY,"Stop sweating. And close your pores, Kirky, I always forgive.",1
EMPLOYEE,,1
PATTY,Once.,1
LORELAI,"Hey, Babette.",1
BABETTE,"Oh, hello, sugar. Can I get you something?",1
LORELAI,"No, I'm fine. I'm looking for Rory.",1
BABETTE,"Oh, I think she might be in the bathroom.",1
LORELAI,Thanks. Can I help you with something?,1
BABETTE,"Oh, no. I thought I'd just get some of this stuff packed away.",1
LORELAI,It's like a scene from a kitty version of 'Valley of the Dolls.',1
BABETTE,Yeah. You never realize how old they actually are 'til you look in the medicine cabinet.,1
LORELAI,Yeah.,1
BABETTE,"These were for her heartworms, for her thyroid, her kidneys, for the rash she got from taking these, and these were for the tic she developed from the stuff for the rash. And these -- oh jeez, these are mine. Damn, I'm gonna miss that old broad.",1
LORELAI,I know.,1
BABETTE,"You know, I don't know what I'm gonna do with myself now. You live to take care of your kids.",1
LORELAI,"I know, sweetie, but you gave her everything that you had.",1
BABETTE,I know. She was so tiny when I got her. She could sleep in my shoe.,1
LORELAI,The other day I came ac ross a hat that I made for Rory. It was like a doll hat.,1
BABETTE,"Oh, they grow up so fast.",1
LORELAI,And then they take your clothes.,1
BABETTE,"I guess eventually you have to move on. Figure out what your life is going to be when you're not busy taking care of somebody else. Jeez, look at this place. Not a clean glass in sight!",1
LORELAI,Let me help you with that.,1
BABETTE,"Here, sugar, use this. Morey sits on it when he helps me.",1
LORELAI,How does Morey get around in here?,1
BABETTE,"Oh, just fine. He had a couple of concussions his first year here but he never complains. He's just the best thing. I don't know what I'd do without him.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, Babette. What do you mean 'without him'?",1
BABETTE,I saw on Oprah a few weeks ago. She had on couples who lost a child. Most of the marriages went belly-up for the pain of it all. Even though they loved each other.,1
LORELAI,"Babette, that is not gonna happen to you.",1
BABETTE,I never thought a man would ever even want me.,1
LORELAI,I know the feeling.,1
BABETTE,"Oh, please, with that ass? Gimme a break.",1
LORELAI,"I mean want me for more than my ass. Me -- for me, the whole package. Annoying neuroses and all.",1
BABETTE,You'll find him. It might even be that stud who drove out of here in a Mustang.,1
LORELAI,Did you see him?,1
BABETTE,"Yeah, what a jaw.",1
LORELAI,He's got a great jaw.,1
BABETTE,How is he in the sack?,1
LORELAI,I haven't even gone out with him yet.,1
BABETTE,Will you tell me w hen how he is when you do?,1
LORELAI,I'll call you during the cigarette.,1
BABETTE,Oh -- that's Cinnamon's song.,1
LORELAI,Oh I can't find Rory anywhere.,1
SOOKIE,I'm sure she's around.,1
LORELAI,Max showed up for the date that I forgot about and she saw him.,1
SOOKIE,And you haven't told her.,1
LORELAI,No.,1
SOOKIE,Oops.,1
LORELAI,Stop with the 'oops.',1
SOOKIE,"OK, calm down. It's not that big of a deal.",1
LORELAI,Her teacher showed up on her porch to take out her mother.,1
SOOKIE,She'll understand. You're crazy. She knows that.,1
LORELAI,"Enough with the comforting, Sookie.",1
SOOKIE,Sorry.,1
DEAN,Hey.,1
RORY,"Jeez, you scared me.",1
DEAN,"Yeah, uh, look. I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.",1
RORY,For what?,1
DEAN,"Well I've been kind of bugging you lately. Uh, I thought -- I don't know -- I thought that maybe you liked me. But it's obvious that you're not interested so I just wanted to say that I get it and I'm not gonna bother you anymore.",1
RORY,Wait! I AM interested.,1
DEAN,You are?,1
RORY,Yes. I gotta go.,1
LORELAI,Oh! Finally. I've been looking everywhere for you.,1
RORY,Well you found me.,1
LORELAI,"Listen, I have some exp laining to do. OK. So sit down in that tiny little chair and I'm gonnado it right now. That man on the porch was your teacher.",1
RORY,"Mom, I'm a little behind in school but not so far behind that I don't know who the teacher is. So?",1
LORELAI,So -- um -- he and I were going to sort of hang out together.,1
RORY,On a date.,1
LORELAI,"No, on a -- something that could appear like a date to the untrained eye.",1
RORY,To your daughter's eye?,1
LORELAI,It was a date.,1
RORY,How long have you been dating him?,1
LORELAI,I haven't. This was gonna be the first time.,1
RORY,And when were you planning on telling me about this -- your wedding?,1
LORELAI,No -- by the rehearsal dinner at least.,1
RORY,He's my teacher.,1
LORELAI,I know.,1
RORY,He teaches me things every day in a very small classroom with a lot of other kids who probably won't be high-fiving me w hen they find this out.,1
LORELAI,"I knw, sweetie, and I told him this was one of the things I was concerned about.",1
RORY,And?,1
LORELAI,And he thought we could be discreet.,1
RORY,Unbelievable!,1
LORELAI,Are you mad?,1
RORY,Yes!,1
LORELAI,Alright. Because I'm dating him?,1
RORY,Because you lied to me.,1
LORELAI,I kept information from you.,1
RORY,Information that I should have had.,1
LORELAI,Information that would have come out eventually. Like the Iran-Contra scandal.,1
RORY,So you're Oliver North.,1
LORELAI,"No, I'm Fawn Hall.",1
RORY,Mom.,1
LORELAI,"Well, she was much prettier.",1
RORY,I just can't believe that you didn't tell me about this. Why wouldn't you tell me?,1
LORELAI,"'Cause I thought you were going to take it bad. Thank God I was wrong. OK, OK. Listen, I'm sorry. I won't date him. I promise.",1
RORY,I'm not saying that you can't date him. It's just -- this is weird. I mean -- there's a million guys in this world and you end up with Mr. Medina.,1
LORELAI,"You think I don't get the weirdness factor? Believe me, the last thing I intended to do was date your teacher.",1
RORY,I believe you.,1
LORELAI,"I really like him, Rory. I can't help it. And it's been a really long time since I've felt like this. You can't always control who you're attracted to, you know. I think the whole Angelina Jolie/Billy Bob Thronton thing really proves that. And I know you don't understand this now but you wil someday. You'll meet some great guy and he'll make your head all foggy and you won't know what to do with yourself. Oh, sweetie, I won't keep anything from you again. OK? I promise. From now on every aspect of my life is an open book to you.",1
RORY,That's OK.,1
LORELAI,"Really, I'm not even going to get dressed until I tell you what I'm thinking of wearing.",1
RORY,Fair enough.,1
LORELAI,"OK, tomorrow I'm thinking the purple tiger top, the black leather skirt, the panda bear underwear.",1
RORY,"Oh, good.",1
LORELAI,But of course I'm totally open to suggestions.,1
RORY,Here's,1
one,get some help.,1
LORELAI,Let us know if we can do anything.,1
BABETTE,"Oh, you've done too much already.",1
LORELAI,"Good-night, Babette.",1
BABETTE,"Good-night, sugar.",1
RORY,"Good-night, Morey.",1
MOREY,"Stay cool, Rory.",1
BABETTE,It's getting late.,1
MOREY,"Let's stay outside a while, baby. Look for the Big Dipper.",1
BABETTE,"OK, I'd like that.",1
LORELAI,Hello.,1
EMILY,I've been trying to get you all afternoon.,1
LORELAI,Mom?,1
EMILY,Yes.,1
LORELAI,Hi.,1
EMILY,You already said that.,1
LORELAI,But someone hasn't.,1
EMILY,Hello.,1
LORELAI,There we go.,1
EMILY,You are impossible to reach.,1
LORELAI,"Well there's no messages on the machine, Mom.",1
EMILY,I don't leave messages. If I wanted to talk to a machine I'd talk to my VCR. Where were you?,1
LORELAI,At a wake.,1
EMILY,A what?,1
LORELAI,A wake...a funeral.,1
EMILY,A funeral? Whose?,1
LORELAI,It was for the neighbors' --,1
LORELAI,-- cat.,1
LORELAI,Mom?,1
EMILY,Hold on. I'm looking up anyuresm in our medical dictionary to see if I just had one.,1
LORELAI,"I just wanted to be honest with you, Mom. Silly me.",1
EMILY,A cat?,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, a cat. It was a cat's funeral.",1
EMILY,You skipped your own cousin's funeral for a cat's funeral?,1
LORELAI,"Not my cousin, mom. My father's grandmother's sister's girl who I've never --",1
EMILY,You said you couldn't be away from the inn.,1
LORELAI,Well I couldn't at the time bt I worked it out.,1
EMILY,For a cat?,1
LORELAI,"It's late. I have a big day tomorrow, Mom.",1
EMILY,"Oh, what? You're going to a racoon's wedding?",1
LORELAI,"Good-night, Mother.",1
EMILY,Good-night.,1
LORELAI,Aaagh! She's working for a sedative manufacturer. Keeping that demand sky-high.,1
RORY,You shouldn't have told her.,1
LORELAI,Well I don't know what to tell and what to hide.,1
RORY,Yeah.,1
LORELAI,So we never did quite settle the whole dating-your-teacher issue. I won't go out with him if you don't want me to.,1
RORY,You can go out with whoever you want.,1
LORELAI,It's whoever we want.,1
RORY,Well I'm certainly not going to go out with him 'cause that would be really weird.,1
LORELAI,But I mean it. I won't see him if you don't want me to.,1
RORY,Huh.,1
LORELAI,"You know, if there's anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, big or small, then he's out of there.",1
RORY,Good to know.,1
LORELAI,"Because you know it's not like I'm desperate. I mean, there are plenty of other guys out there.",1
RORY,,1
LORELAI,"And it's not like I have to ask your permission. I mean, this is a courtesy.",1
RORY,OK.,1
LORELAI,"OK, so I'm going to be up for a while, if you want to get back to me on this.",1
RORY,I know where you are.,1
RORY,"Hey, do you think you could keep him out really late on Thursday night because I have this oral exam on Friday that I'd really love him to sleep through.",1

LORELAI,One of us has to do laundry tonight.,1
RORY,Why?,1
LORELAI,Because I haven't had any clean underwear for three days.,1
RORY,So right now under your skirt you're wearing...?,1
LORELAI,Not underwear.,1
RORY,Mom!,1
LORELAI,"It's kinda nice, actually -- breezy.",1
RORY,"My role model, ladies and gentlemen.",1
LORELAI,How come you haven't run out yet?,1
RORY,I don't know. I guess I have more underwear than you.,1
LORELAI,That's not true. You have less. Have you been doing laundry without me?,1
RORY,No.,1
LORELAI,Rory?,1
RORY,"OK, one load.",1
LORELAI,And you didn't even ask if I had stuff to throw in?,1
RORY,It was a big load. There wasn't any room.,1
LORELAI,"I'm crushed. I'm bleeding. Get me a tourniquet. Oh, no, they're dirty 'cause Rory wouldn't wash them with her stuff.",1
RORY,"I'm sorry. I'll do another load tonight, I promise.",1
LORELAI,Never mind. I'll do my own laundry.,1
RORY,"Fine, even better.",1
LORELAI,I hate doing laundry. Maybe I'll just buy new underwear.,1
Posted,,1
PATTY,"And flutter, flutter, flutter, flutter, flutter...and leaves. Where are my leaves? I got pumpkins, I got Pilgrims, I got no leaves.",1
TAYLORory,Every other store in town has fall decorations.,1
LUKE,Hoorah for the mob mentality.,1
TAYLORory,We're talking a few streamers and a paper turkey. How's it gonna hurt to have a paper turkey?,1
LUKE,"No turkey, no squash, no pumpkins. Nothing colored orange.",1
TAYLORory,"OK, you don't like orange. That's fine. Autumn has many varied hues to toy with.",1
LORELAI,"Excuse me, can we get some coffee please?",1
RORY,And a muffin?,1
LORELAI,Warmed?,1
TAYLORory,This is the Autumn Festival. Your show is right across the street from the Horn of Plenty! You're right smack dab in the middle of everything. You have to decorate.,1
LUKE,I don't have to do anything but serve food.,1
LORELAI,And coffee!,1
RORY,And muffins!,1
LUKE,"Taylor, I'm tired of having this conversation with you every year.",1
LORELAI,Yoo-hoo!,1
TAYLORory,"You have lived in Stars Hollow for a long time, young man. It's time you became one of us.",1
LORELAI,Whoo!,1
LUKE,"Sorry, I guess my pod's defective.",1
RORY,Hey. My mom's not wearing any underwear.,1
LORELAI,Oh!,1
RORY,Well you aren't.,1
TAYLORory,"You're just being selfish, Luke.",1
LORELAI,Still they don't notice. I can't take it anymore.,1
TAYLORory,We're talking about the spirit of fall. (Lorelai gets the coffee herself and lifts the cover off the muffins.,1
LORELAI,What kind of muffin do you want?,1
RORY,Blueberry.,1
LUKE,You know where you can stick the spirit of fall?,1
LUKE,"Here, don't use your hands.",1
TAYLORory,I don't think you're taking me seriously.,1
LUKE,What gave you that idea? No tip?,1
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, here's a tip -- serve your customers.",1
LUKE,Here's another -- don't sit on any cold benches.,1
LUKE,"Taylore, I swear to God, if you pull those Pilgrims out of your pocket one more time...",1
TAYLORory,I'm just doing it -- LUKE No.,1
TAYLORory,I don't know. It doesn't really look like the Mayflower.,1
DEAN,Well we could put a sign on it or something.,1
TAYLORory,I don't know.,1
DEAN,So do you want to go back to the Plymouth Rock idea?,1
TAYLORory,We'll just live with it that way for a day.,1
DEAN,"You know, you can get two for three bucks.",1
RORY,Oh really? Excellent deal.,1
DEAN,You just had a desperate need for some cornstarch?,1
RORY,"Yes. I have very important thickening needs, thank you. Nice apron.",1
DEAN,Nice uniform.,1
RORY,"Well, you know, I sewed the buttons on with silver thread so that sets me apart from the crowd. I guess I should get home.",1
DEAN,Wait a sec. You want a pop or something?,1
RORY,A pop?,1
DEAN,Give me a b reak. In Chicago they call it pop.,1
RORY,"Well in Connecticut we call it free soda. And yes, thank you.",1
DEAN,"Alright, guess which is in each hand and you get the soda.",1
RORY,"OK, the whole concept a free soda is that it's free, you don't have to work for it.",1
DEAN,Sorry you gotta sing for your supper.,1
RORY,Or your soda.,1
DEAN,Guess.,1
RORY,"OK, in this hand you have --",1
RORY,Thank you.,1
RORY,Lane? Lane?,1
LANE,What's wrong?,1
RORY,I got kissed! And I shoplifted.,1
LANE,Are you serious? Who kissed you?,1
RORY,Dean.,1
LANE,The new kid?,1
RORY,Yes.,1
LANE,You got the new kid? Oh my God!,1
RORY,It happened so fast. I was just standing there --,1
LANE,Where?,1
RORY,Doose's Market.,1
LANE,He kissed you in the market?,1
RORY,On aisle three.,1
LANE,By the pest spray?,1
RORY,Yes.,1
LANE,"Oh, that's a good aisle.",1
RORY,What defines a good aisle?,1
LANE,An aisle where you get kissed by the new kid is a good aisle.,1
RORY,Oh my God. I can't breathe.,1
LANE,"OK, sit down.",1
RORY,,1
KIM,Who kissed you?,1
LANE,,1
KIM,"Oh, OK then.",1
LANE,So? Tell me ev erything.,1
RORY,So I go into the store and he offers me a soda. And then he puts two behind his back and he asks me to pick one and then he kissed me.,1
LANE,"I'm so jealous! That's it, I've got to get some dumb, ugly friends.",1
RORY,I have to go tell my mom.,1
LANE,Call me later.,1
RORY,OK.,1
LANE,What's wrong?,1
RORY,I can't.,1
LANE,You can't leave? It's sing your favorite hymn night at the Kim house. Make a run for it.,1
RORY,My mom doesn't know about Dean.,1
LANE,So tell her.,1
RORY,The last time the subject of boys came up it got very ugly.,1
LANE,Well that was different. She thought you were gonna to quit school over a guy.,1
RORY,"Yes, over Dean.",1
LANE,"OK, fine, but she doesn't have to know it was him.",1
RORY,She'll know.,1
LANE,How?,1
RORY,"She's Lorelai, she'll know. What do I do?",1
LANE,Well maybe she'll be more open to the concept now that you're in school and doing so well and everything.,1
RORY,Maybe.,1
LANE,Try it.,1
RORY,OK. I gotta go.,1
LANE,"Hey, was it great?",1
RORY,It was perfect.,1
LANE,Wow.,1
RORY,Yeah.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, can you hear that? No, no, it's higher, it's like a high-pitched kind of an ""EEEEEE!"" sound. It started last week but it was lower and it only happened when we opened the door and now it's higher and it's on all the time so I think it's really, uh, growing in confidence. OK, look, I've already told this to three other people so could you just please tell me what is wrong with this fridge? I'm not going to make the noise again. I'm not --- EEEEEE! Look, Jerry, I don't have a lot of pride but I do have enough that I do not want to make that noise again, so could you please, tell me what is wrong with the fridge or connect me with someone who can? Thank you. Hello...Rusty, great. Listen, my fridge is making this weird sound. It's like a high-pitched -- you know what -- actually, is Jerry still there? OK, have him make the sound. He knows it. I'll wait. I know! It does sound bad. OK,here is the deal. You will send someone out here, tomorrow, between the hours of eight and nine, because I work and I can't wait four hours for one of you guys to show up. Great! Good-bye.",1
RORY,So are they coming tomorrow?,1
LORELAI,"Nope. Monday, between three and eight. I am completely useless.",1
RORY,Sorry.,1
LORELAI,Oh my God! Look at this place. It's a sty! Now I'm crabby. I'm crabby and useless. Stupid fridge! Stupid fridge guys! I hate my life.,1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,Yes.,1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,Rory's not here.,1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,Six weeks ago.,1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,This is not a storage facility.,1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,"This is a furniture store. Furniture comes in, people buy, then it goes out.",1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,Except when Lorelai Gilmore buys. Then furniture stays here for six weeks.,1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,,1
KIM,Here.,1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,It's been six weeks. Maybe it grew.,1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,Maybe you should be less busy. Then you can remember to pick up chairs.,1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,And then you could keep your daughter from running around kissing boys.,1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,"Lane is a young, impressionable girl. She doesn't need to hear about your daughter's kissing.",1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,Loopy? What's loopy?,1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,Yes she is. She came in here and told Lane she kissed a boy in the grocery store. The grocery store! Where we buy our food.,1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,"Yes, yes, yes. The boy in the grocery store. Kiss, kiss, kiss.",1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,You left your chair!,1
LANE,"OK, just one more time.",1
RORY,I've been telling you this story for an hour. It doesn't get dirty.,1
LANE,I can't help it. I'm obsessed. I'm totally living vicariously through you.,1
RORY,Why? You got kissed last weekend. Remember? You told me. That guy your parents set you up with. The one with the Lincoln Continental. What's his name? Patrick Cho!,1
LANE,"OK, let's do a little compare and contrast here. You get kissed on the mouth by a cute, cool, sexy guy you really like. And I get kissed on the forehead by a theology major in a Members-Only jacket who truly believes that rock music leads to hard dr*gs.",1
RORY,Fair enough. You can live through me. But just remember that I have no idea what I'm doing.,1
LANE,I'm well aware of that. That's why I've been diligently gathering information for us.,1
RORY,What kind of information?,1
LANE,"Well, let's see. Dean's from Ch icago, which you know.",1
RORY,I do.,1
LANE,He likes Nick Drake and Liz Phair and the Sugarplastic and he's deathly allergic to walnuts.,1
RORY,Walnuts -- bad. Got it.,1
LANE,"Now, he had a girlfriend in Chicago.",1
RORY,A girlfriend?,1
LANE,Her name's Beth and they went out for about a year but they split amicably before he left and now she's dating his cousin. Which he doesn't feel too weird about because he doesn't think they were really in love.,1
RORY,Beth.,1
LANE,I wouldn't worry about it.,1
RORY,How'd you get all this information?,1
LANE,"Through his best friend, who, by the way, is really cool. So once you get settled with Dean do you think you could ask him about Todd?",1
RORY,"Oh, absolutely. So, Beth, huh? I hate the name Beth. It's so...Beth.",1
LANE,"Now, Todd also said that Dean hasn't been able to talk about anything but you for weeks!",1
LANE,,1
PATTY,"Oh, Luke, the food here is lovely but you know what would make it even better?",1
LUKE,Let me,1
guess,,1
PATTY,"Well food without ambience isn't really food, is it?",1
LUKE,,1
PATTY,"Oh, no, thank you. It's much too depressing in here for tea.",1
LUKE,,1
PATTY,"Yes, but at least he's a festive one.",1
LUKE,Just eat.,1
LUKE,"Coffee? Aw, come on. Are you mad at me too? I mean, a man can't choose whether or not he wants a picture of a fat, stupid bird on his wall? My God, that's the reason the damn Pilgrims came here in the first place.",1
LORELAI,"Luke, I wasn't snubbing you. I didn't hear you and now I'm concerned about you.",1
LUKE,"Sorry, just feeling a little persecuted lately. Coffee?",1
LORELAI,Please.,1
LUKE,You OK?,1
LORELAI,"Yes, I'm fine.",1
LUKE,You don't look fine.,1
LORELAI,Well thank you.,1
LUKE,I just meant you look concerned.,1
LORELAI,I'm preoccupied.,1
LUKE,You look concerned.,1
LORELAI,Well I'm not.,1
LUKE,"Fine, you just look it.",1
LORELAI,"Hey, you know some streamers would look so great in here.",1
LUKE,"OK, I'm done.",1
LORELAI,Thank you.,1
RORY,"Sorry, sorry, sorry.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, hey. Save your apologies for the Indians, missy.",1
RORY,People are really in a giving mood today. The horn of plenty is packed.,1
LORELAI,That's great. Do you want some coffee?,1
RORY,"Oh, no, I'll just have a sip of yours. I have to get right back.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, really? I thought we were having lunch today.",1
RORY,I can't. We're one Pilgrim short. I only have a couple minutes.,1
LORELAI,Oh. You've been really busy lately.,1
RORY,Yeah. I guess it's that end-of-the-year rush,1
LORELAI,"I mean, we haven't even really talked in a couple of days.",1
RORY,What do you want to talk about?,1
LORELAI,I don't know. Anything.,1
RORY,OK. Did you read that article in the newspaper about the polar ice caps melting?,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, yeah. Ooh big deal.",1
RORY,Fine. You pick the subject.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, OK, great. I was watching General Hospital the other day and you know, they have a new Lucky 'cause the old Lucky went to play something where he could have a real name. So the old Lucky had this girlfriend, Liz, who thought that he died in a fire. So then they bring on this newLucky and you're all like ""OK, I know that's not the old Lucky because the new Lucky has way more hair gel issues"" but still, Liz was so upset about his supposed death that you could not wait to see them kiss, you know?",1
RORY,When do you have time to watch General Hospital?,1
LORELAI,"OK, let's get back to the point. What do you think about the whole Liz/Lucky kissing thing?",1
RORY,I think they're actors being paid to play a part so it's nice that they're living up to their obligations.,1
LORELAI,Hmm. Rory --,1
RORY,"Look, can we finish this very meaningful conversation later? I promised Lane I'd get right back.",1
LORELAI,"OK, I'll see you later.",1
RORY,OK. Bye.,1
LORELAI,Bye.,1
LUKE,I'm not gonna say you look concerned.,1
LORELAI,I'm not gonna talk about how good you'd look dressed like one of the guys from 'The Crucible.',1
LUKE,Fair enough.,1
LUKE,Hey.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, God! What are you doing?",1
LUKE,What are you doing?,1
LORELAI,I asked you first.,1
LUKE,I ran out of cream.,1
LORELAI,Yeah me too.,1
LUKE,What are you starin' at?,1
LORELAI,"Nothing. Don't look, don't look.",1
LUKE,What is wrong with you today?,1
LORELAI,Rory got kissed.,1
LUKE,What?,1
LORELAI,Rory had her first kiss and that guy did it.,1
LUKE,Ah.,1
LORELAI,Yeah.,1
LUKE,The new kid.,1
LORELAI,Yep.,1
LORELAI,Oh look at him. Look how smug he is.,1
LUKE,He's bagging groceries. It's hard to be smug bagging groceries.,1
LORELAI,Oh look how he just handled those lemons.,1
LUKE,What are you talking about?,1
LORELAI,He threw them in the bag. Not tossed them or placed them but threw them like they were nothing to him.,1
LUKE,They're lemons.,1
LORELAI,They're symbolic.,1
LUKE,OK. We need to get you out of here.,1
LORELAI,No. That' Lothario over there has wormed his way into my daughter's heart and mouth and for that he must die!,1
LUKE,"That's it, let's go.",1
LORELAI,No.,1
LUKE,You're not going to k*ll the bag boy.,1
LORELAI,Why not?,1
LUKE,It's double coupon day. You'll bring down the town.,1
LORELAI,"OK, OK. I'm out. Stop pushing me.",1
LUKE,What are you thinking spying on that kid like that?,1
LORELAI,I don't know. I just wanted to see him. I mean I've seen him already but that was before he was --,1
LUKE,Rory's boyfriend?,1
LORELAI,"Shush, you.",1
LUKE,She's growing up.,1
LORELAI,I know.,1
LUKE,There's nothing you can do about that.,1
LORELAI,"OK, Mr. Reality, break into somebody's else's house.",1
LUKE,Sorry.,1
LORELAI,Why didn't she tell me?,1
LUKE,What?,1
LORELAI,Why didn't Rory tell me ab out the kiss?,1
LUKE,Maybe she didn't know you'd take it so well.,1
LORELAI,Want to hear something crazy?,1
LUKE,'Cause all the talk up until now has been so normal.,1
LORELAI,He kind of looks like Christopher.,1
LUKE,The grocery kid?,1
LORELAI,Yeah. He looks like Christopher.,1
LUKE,And Christopher is Rory's dad?,1
LORELAI,"The hair, the build, something about the eyes. He reminds me of Christopher.",1
LUKE,Well that's not too surprising.,1
LORELAI,You're going to quote Freud to me? 'Cause I'll push you in front of a moving car. This talk was going so well.,1
LUKE,You and Rory are a lot alike. It's not surprising you would have similar tastes in men.,1
LORELAI,I guess. But why? Why didn't she tell me? We tell each other everything.,1
LUKE,This is different,1
LORELAI,But we tell each other everything else. But this she keeps a secret. It's 'cause it's a guy thing.,1
LUKE,Probably.,1
LORELAI,Well that's not good. I have to make her understand that I'm OK with the guy thing. 'Cause not talking about guys and our personal lives -- that's me and my mom. That is not me and Rory.,1
LUKE,Are you OK with the guy thing?,1
LORELAI,Yes.,1
LUKE,Really?,1
LORELAI,OK...ish.,1
LUKE,That's not OK.,1
LORELAI,Well it's OK with an -ish.,1
LUKE,Whatever you say.,1
LORELAI,"She just -- she thinks I'll disapprove, right? Well I won't. I will show her that I think this is great. Once she sees that I think this is great, everything will be back to normal between us, right? Right -- OK, good.",1
LUK,E So you passed the need for an actual person to talk to several minutes ago.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah. Before the gelato stand.",1
LUKE,You're an amazing woman.,1
LOREALI,Thank you for noticing.,1
RORY,"Hey, sorry I'm late.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, hey, no big deal. There's Chinese in the fridge.",1
RORY,OK.,1
LORELAI,So...kissed any good boys lately?,1
RORY,Who...?,1
LORELAI,Mrs. Kim.,1
RORY,Of course.,1
LORELAI,"So, he's cute.",1
RORY,"Yeah, he is.",1
LORELAI,Can he spell?,1
RORY,He can spell and read. How long have you known?,1
LORELAI,Since this morning. You didn't think you were gonna be able to keep it a secret did you? You were making out in the market.,1
RORY,We weren't making out. It was just one kiss.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, well by the time that gets to Miss Patty's it's a scene from 9 1/2 Weeks.",1
RORY,You've known all this time? At Luke's? Here?,1
LORLELAI,Yeah.,1
RORY,You could have said something.,1
LORELAI,"Now, funny, I was going to say the same thing to you.",1
RORY,So...,1
LORELAI,So...,1
RORY,What now?,1
LORELAI,Now? Nothing?,1
RORY,No? No lecture about kissing a boy?,1
LORELAI,Why? Did you do it wrong?,1
RORY,No...I don't think.,1
LORELAI,"I didn't love the way I found out, but you're getting older. These things are bound to happen occasionally. Actually I think it's great.",1
RORY,No you don't.,1
LORELAI,Yes I do. I'm thrilled.,1
RORY,Thrilled?,1
LORELAI,Yeah.,1
RORY,You're completely weirded out by this aren't you?,1
LORELAI,No. You're crazy. I'm perfectly fine with it.,1
RORY,You don't seem fine. You seem the complete opposite of fine.,1
LORELAI,"Well you're projecting that on me because you don't want to think that I'm fine when I am, as I have said, fine.",1
RORY,OK.,1
LORELAI,Never been finer.,1
RORY,Got it. You want some?,1
LORELAI,"No, thanks. I'm fine.",1
LORELAI,"OK, we have to be really quick, 'cause the video store's gonna close, so stick to our list. No impulse buying like toothpaste or soap.",1
LORELAI,Rory?,1
RORY,"Hey, I think we have enough stuff to eat at home.",1
LORELAI,Really...where do you live? 'Cause the home I left this morning had nothing.,1
RORY,Well we're ordering pizza. That's enough.,1
LORELAI,Are you crazy? You can't watch Willy Wonka without massive amounts of junk food! It's not right. I won't allow it. We're going in.,1
LORELAI,"Rory, it's fine.",1
RORY,It's too weird.,1
LORELAI,I'm gonna have to meet him eventually.,1
RORY,OK. How about next year?,1
LORELAI,I'm going to be so cool in there you will mistake me for Shaft.,1
RORY,There will be no interrogation.,1
LORELAI,I swear.,1
RORY,No kissing noises. No stories from my childhood. No referring to Chicago as Chitown. No James Dean jokes. No father with a shotgun stares. No Nancy Walker impressions.,1
LORELAI,Oh come on!,1
RORY,Promise me.,1
LORELAI,I really and truly promise. Now can we please go to the market?,1
RORY,OK. Let's go.,1
RORY,I don't see him.,1
LORELAI,All right. Well maybe he's on a break.,1
RORY,"Yeah. Yeah, maybe he's on a break.",1
LORELAI,Yeah.,1
RORY,"OK, good. So we can shop.",1
LORELAI,Yep.,1
RORY,Do we want marshmallows?,1
LORELAI,"Mmm...and jelly beans and chocolate kisses. Cookie dough we have at home. Peanut butter. Ooh, do you think they have that thing that's like a sugar stick on one side but then you dipit in the sugar on the other side then you eat it?",1
RORY,We are going to be so sick. It's amazing that we still function. There he is.,1
LORELAI,"Boy, he's tall. That must have been some back-bender, that kiss.",1
RORY,Mom!,1
LORELAI,Make sure you warm up next time.,1
RORY,"OK, we are leaving now.",1
LORELAI,Sorry. Done now. He's got great eyes! You got to love a guy with great eyes.,1
RORY,Yeah.,1
LORELAI,And a nice smile.,1
RORY,Very nice.,1
LORELAI,Think we can get him to turn around?,1
RORY,It's nice too.,1
LORELAI,Really?,1
RORY,Trust me.,1
LORELAI,Hey.,1
CASHIERory,"Oh, you girls having another movie night?",1
LORELAI,Yeah...It's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.,1
CASHIERory,"Oh, that's nice. Isn't that the one with Gene Hackman?",1
DEAN,"Uh, Gene Wilder.",1
LORELAI,You're a Wonka fan?,1
DEAN,Yeah.,1
RORY,"Um, Dean, this is my mom, Lorelai. Mom, this is Dean.",1
LORELAI,"Nice to meet you, Dean.",1
DEAN,"Yeah, you too.",1
LORELAI,Nice apron.,1
DEAN,Um...thanks.,1
CASHIERory,Forty-one eighty-three.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, wow. It's expensive to slowly rot your insides isn't it? Here you go.",1
RORY,Thank you.,1
DEAN,You're welcome.,1
LORELAI,"So, Dean, nice meet ing you. Hope to see you again.",1
DEAN,Yeah.,1
LORELAI,See that wasn't so bad.,1
RORY,You're right.,1
LORELAI,"I said nothing embarrassing, nothing stupid.",1
RORY,I appreciate that.,1
LORELAI,"So chill out, Supermarket sl*t.",1
RORY,"See, even a little information in your hands is dangerous.",1
LORELAI,I need coffee.,1
RORY,"Mom, the video store closes in ten minutes.",1
LORELAI,Well you run to the video store and I'll go get coffe.,1
RORY,Fine.,1
LORELAI,"Go, go, go. I'll meet you at Luke's.",1
DEAN,"Hey, you forgot your Red Vines.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, wow! You totally saved the night. Thanks.",1
DEAN,Sure.,1
LORELAI,"Hey, what are you doing tonight?",1
DEAN,"Me? Uh, well, I don't know.",1
LORELAI,"Well, do you want to come over? We're ordering pizza. We've got a movie. The neighborhood's got a pool going to see who falls into a sugar coma first. I'm the favorite. It might be fun.",1
DEAN,"Uh, well, um...uh.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, it's totally casual. I'm sure Rory would love it.",1
DEAN,"OK, sure.",1
LORELAI,Yeah?,1
DEAN,"Yeah, what time?",1
LORELAI,Seven sound good?,1
DEAN,Sounds fine.,1
LORELAI,Let me give you our address.,1
DEAN,That's OK. I know where you live.,1
LORELAI,Of course you do. So see you tonight.,1
DEAN,Bye.,1
LORELAI,Bye.,1
LORELAI,So?,1
RORY,Got it!,1
LORELAI,"Score! You know, on the one hand I'm glad it was in but on the other hand what kind of world do we live in where no one has rented Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory?",1
RORY,Well we rented it.,1
LORELAI,"Well thank God for us. Oh, hey, I invited your friend.",1
RORY,What friend?,1
LORELAI,Dean.,1
RORY,What?,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, I told him what we were doing tonight and he was totally into it so -- Why are you looking at me like that?",1
RORY,You invited Dean? To our house?,1
LORELAI,Yes.,1
RORY,Are you crazy?,1
LORELAI,Why are you mad?,1
RORY,Because we haven't even been out on a date by ourselves yet. My first date with Dean is going to be with my mother? Are -- What is wrong with you?,1
LORELAI,I'm sorry. I thought you would be happy about this.,1
RORY,In what universe would I be happy? This isn't Amish country. Girls and boys usually date alone.,1
LORELAI,I don't think of it as a date. I thought of it more as a hanging out kind of session.,1
RORY,Well I don't want our first hanging out session to be with my mother either.,1
LORELAI,Stop saying mother like that.,1
RORY,Like what?,1
LORELAI,Like there's supposed to be another word after it.,1
RORY,I can't believe you did this. I'm so humiliated.,1
LORELAI,"You're totally overreacting. I invited him to a movie and pizza, not to Niagra Falls.",1
RORY,He's the boy that I like.,1
LORELAI,I know. I looked for one that you hated but it was really short notice.,1
RORY,And now he's forced to come over and sit with me and my mother and eat crap and watch a movie?,1
LORELAI,Well I just invited a friend of yours to hang out. What's the big deal? I mean what if Lane had done it?,1
RORY,You're not Lane. You're my mother. You inviting him over is like Grandma inviting a guy you liked over.,1
LORELAI,You're comparing me to my mother?,1
RORY,"No, I just --",1
LORELAI,"I'm Emily Gilmore? My, how the mighty have fallen.",1
RORY,I didn't mean that.,1
LORELAI,I wasn't trying to humiliate you.,1
RORY,I know.,1
LORELAI,If I was Emily Gilmore I'd be trying to humiliate you.,1
RORY,I just --,1
LORELAI,"Look, I'm sorry, OK? I screwed up. I was trying to -- Look, I'll go, I'll uninvite him. I'll tell him that it's cancelled on account of I just found out I'm my mother and I have to go into intensive therapy right now.",1
RORY,"No, you can't uninvite him. He'll think I totally wigged out or something.",1
LORELAI,Well then I'll just disappear and you guys can be alone.,1
RORY,"Oh, and have it look like my mom arranged a date for me? No!",1
LORELAI,What do we do?,1
RORY,He has to come.,1
LORELAI,"It won't be so bad, OK? Just pizza and a movie and hanging out. I promise you won't feel like your mother is there.",1
RORY,OK.,1
LORELAI,"OK. You might, however, feel like my mother is there.",1
RORY,"Oh, boy.",1
LORELAI,Well...,1
LORELAI,Hey. This is good. Add some cold cream and some curlers and let him know what he'll be coming home to every night.,1
RORY,"This was supposed to be a simple night. Watch movie, eat junk, go to bed feeling sick. End of story. Now I'm supposed to look pretty and girly, which is completely impossible because I'm gross and I have nothing to wear.",1
LORELAI,Do you want some help?,1
RORY,No...yes.,1
LORELAI,OK. Uh...let's see. We'll do this and...,1
LORELAI,"All right This says 'hello, I'm hip and cute but also relaxed since this is something I just threw on even though it looks fantastic on me.'",1
RORY,How'd you do that?,1
LORELAI,What?,1
RORY,"I've been staring at that top for twenty minutes. It was just a top. You walked in and in three seconds, it's an outfit.",1
LORELAI,It comes from years of experiencing fashion brain freeze like the one you just had.,1
RORY,How do you do it?,1
LORELAI,What?,1
RORY,"This whole guy thing. I mean I've watched you when you talk to a man. You have a comeback for everything, you make him laugh, you smile right --",1
LORELAI,I smile right?,1
RORY,And then you do the little hair flip.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, twirl. It's a hair twirl.",1
RORY,"And then you walk away and he just stands there, amazed, like he can't believe what just happened.",1
LORELAI,That's because I just stole his wallet.,1
RORY,"I'll never be able to do that. Trig, I can do. But boys and dating? Forget it. I'm a total spaz.",1
LORELAI,"Listen, the talking part, you just get used to. The hair twirl I can teach you. And the leaving him amazed part -- with your brain and k*ller blue eyes I'm not worried. You'll do fine. Just give yourself a little time to get there.",1
RORY,Is half an hour enough?,1
LORELAI,"Plenty. Come on. Dab on some lip gloss, clear but fruity. Maybe a little mascara. Wear your hair down and your attitude high.",1
RORY,You're like a crazy Elsa Klensch.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, thank you! Come on now, hustle. We got a man coming over.",1
RORY,What time did you tell him to get here?,1
LORELAI,Seven.,1
RORY,Maybe something happened. Maybe he's not coming.,1
LORELAI,"Maybe he's just late, Miss German train.",1
LORELAI,Oops.,1
RORY,What?,1
BABETTE,There used be a great club there called -- what was it called baby?,1
MOREY,Uh...Mr. Kelly's.,1
BABETTE,"Oh, yeah--Mr. Kelly's. You ever go there?",1
RORY,They've got Dean.,1
LORELAI,Wait here.,1
BABETTE,"So, Dean, you like jazz?",1
DEAN,"Sure, yeah.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, he sure does. That's all we ever hear about, right?. Jazz, jazz. Jazz, jazz, jazz. Hey.",1
BABETTE,"Hey, sugar. We were just getting to know your young man, here.",1
LORELAI,"Yeah, I see that. So, Dean, um, would you mind going inside and helping Rory out? There's a struggle with a pickle jar lid that I think she's about to lose.",1
DEAN,"Oh, sure, yeah.",1
BABETTE,"Oh it was nice talking to you, Dean.",1
DEAN,"Yeah, you too.",1
MOREY,"Stay cool, kid.",1
DEAN,I will.,1
BABETTE,"Oh, he's so cute.",1
LORELAI,Yeah.,1
BABETTE,And that Chuck Heston chin of his. Is he Rory's boyfriend?,1
LORELAI,"No, they're just friends.",1
BABETTE,That's not what I heard. Kissing at the market. Gives a whole new meaning to tasting day.,1
LORELAI,OK. I got to get back inside and shower. So I'll talk to you guys later.,1
BABETE,"Yeah, have a good evening. And don't forget to invite us to the wedding. Oh won't their kids be gorgeous!",1
LORELAI,Oh. God I hope not.,1
DEAN,I'm sorry I'm late. I got here like a half hour ago.,1
RORY,We believe you.,1
LORELAI,We'd believe you if you said you got here three hours ago.,1
LORELAI,"So, Dean, how do you like it here in Stars Hollow?",1
DEAN,"I like it. It's quiet, but nice. I like all the trees everywhere.",1
LORELAI,"Yeah, the trees are something. When Rory was little, she found out that one was called a Weeping Willow so she spent hours trying to cheer it up. You know, like telling it jokes and -- No, I'm sorry that was me. Would you like a tour of the house?",1
DEAN,OK.,1
LORELAI,"OK. So this is the living room where we do our living and, um, upstairs is my room and the good bathroom. And the...kitchen is right through here. You ever heard a fridge yodel before?",1
RORY,Thank you.,1
LORELAI,You're welcome. Well you have your,1
basics,"microwave for popcorn, stove for storing shoes, refrigerator, which is completely worthless.",1
DEAN,Interesting.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, I'll get that. Rory, you take over as tour guide. Make sure and show him the emergency exits.",1
RORY,That's my mom.,1
DEAN,She's got energy.,1
RORY,"Yeah well she's 90% water, 10% caffeine.",1
DEAN,So what's in there?,1
RORY,"Um, that's my room.",1
DEAN,Really? Can I see it?,1
DEAN,Wow. Very clean. How much does it suck that they use 'Pink Moon' in a Volkswagen commer cial?,1
RORY,"Oh, I know.",1
DEAN,So you gonna come in ?,1
RORY,"Oh, no. I've seen it.",1
DEAN,I mean you look like you're glued to the door there.,1
RORY,"No -- I'm just, uh, observing my room from a new perspective. You know, I hardly ever stand here. It's really making me rethink my throw pillows.",1
DEAN,Would you like me to get out of here?,1
RORY,"No, I'm fine with you looking around.",1
DEAN,Nice chicken,1
RORY,"Or, you know, at least I was.",1
LORELAI,"We do not need dessert, Sookie.",1
SOOKIE,"Oh, everybody needs dessert. So, where is Rory?",1
LORELAI,With Dean.,1
SOOKIE,"Dean? Oh, that's right, yeah, Dean is here.",1
LORELAI,"Yeah, right. OK. You need to go now.",1
SOOKIE,Please. I just want one little peek.,1
LORELAI,No.,1
SOOKIE,"OK, fine, so, uh, how are you? How are you doing? How you doing? Are you --",1
LORELAI,Sookie.,1
SOOKIE,I'm concerned.,1
LORELAI,You're stalling.,1
SOOKIE,Am I?,1
LORELAI,Sookie. (Lorelai opens the door to let Sookie out. The pizza delivery guy is standing on the other side.,1
JOE,"Hey, Lorelai.",1
LORELAI,"Hey, Joe. What do I owe ya?",1
JOE,Fifteen even.,1
LORELAI,OK. How are you doing?,1
JOE,Awesome.,1
SOOKIE,What did you get on your pizza? Did you ask for extra sauce? Because I always ask for extra sauce because sometimes --,1
LORELAI,"Sookie, she's already freaked out that I invited him here. If she thinks I'm parading him around in front of all my friends, she'll k*ll me.",1
SOOKIE,But I just --,1
LORELAI,"Death, bloody and slow, OK?",1
RORY,"Mom, is that the pizza?",1
LORELAI,"Yeah. OK, bye. Now go.",1
SOOKIE,Bu I just wanted --,1
LORELAI,No. Bye.,1
SOOKIE,Bye-bye.,1
LORELAI,So are you hungry?,1
DEAN,Starving.,1
RORY,Where's the pizza?,1
LORELAI,"The pizza's, uh --",1
SOOKIE,Pizza!,1
SOOKIE,"Just bringing in the pizza. Hi, I'm Sookie. I'm a friend of Lorela's.",1
DEAN,Hi.,1
SOOKIE,"Hi. Nice to meet you, Dean. I mean, not that I knew you were Dean. But you do look like a Dean. Doesn't he look like a Dean?",1
LORELAI,Yeah. Of all the people in this room he looks most like a Dean. Bye Sookie. Have fun!,1
SOOKIE,OK.,1
DEAN,"Here, um, I'll take that.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, thanks. Great. The coffee table's fine.",1
LORELAI,I did not invite her here.,1
RORY,Why didn't you just set up a camera and broadcast it over the internet?,1
LORELAI,Because I don't think that big.,1
DEAN,Thank God there's good pizza here.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah. Now we didn't know what kind you liked so we just got everything.",1
DEAN,Everything is fine.,1
LORELAI,"Good, well, while it's hot.",1
LORELAI,Who needs more?,1
RORY,I do.,1
DEAN,Wow. You can eat.,1
RORY,Yes I can. Oh that's bad isn't it?,1
DEAN,"No, uh, most girls don't eat. It's good you eat.",1
LORELAI,I'm all for it.,1
RORY,"Let's talk about something besides my eating habits, shall we?",1
LORELAI,Oooh -- Oompa Loompas!,1
RORY,My mom has a thing for the Oompa Loompas.,1
LORELAI,I don't think finding them amusing constitutes a thing.,1
RORY,"No, but having a recurring dream about marrying one does.",1
LORELAI,"Don't even get me started on your Prince Charming crush, OK? At least my obsessions are alive. You have a thing for a cartoon.",1
DEAN,"Ooh, Prince Charming, huh?",1
RORY,"It was a long time ag o. And not the Cinderella one, the Sleeping Beauty one.",1
DEAN,'Cause he could dance.,1
RORY,Yeah.,1
DEAN,I've got sisters.,1
LORELAI,"So, come on, Dean, tell us some of your embarrassing secrets.",1
DEAN,"Well, I have no embarrassing secrets.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, please.",1
RORY,I bet I know one.,1
DEAN,What?,1
RORY,The theme from Ice Castles makes you cry.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, that's a good one.",1
DEAN,That's not true.,1
LORELAI,"Oh I've got one. At the end of The Way We Were, you wanted Robert Redford to dump his wife and kid for Barbra Streisand.",1
DEAN,I've never seen The Way We Were.,1
LORELAI,Oh!,1
RORY,Are you kidding?,1
LORELAI,"What are you waiting for? Heartache, laughter --",1
RORY,Communism.,1
LORELAI,All in one neat package.,1
DEAN,I'll have to experience that sometime.,1
LORELAI,Next movie night.,1
RORY,It's a plan.,1
LORELAI,I'll get the popcorn.,1
RORY,Bring in the spray cheese.,1
DEAN,"So, uh, at what point does the outsider get to suggest a movie for movie night?",1
RORY,That depends. What movie are you thinking of?,1
DEAN,"I don't know...Boogie Nights, maybe.",1
RORY,You'll never get that past Lorelai.,1
DEAN,Not a Marky Mark fan?,1
RORY,She had a bad reaction to Magnolia. She sat there screaming for three hours 'I want my life back!' and then we got kicked out of the theater. It was actually a pretty entertaining day.,1
DEAN,Yeah?,1
RORY,Yeah.,1
DEAN,I guess I'll have to come up with a different movie then.,1
RORY,I guess you will.,1
DEAN,That Oompa Loompa -- right there. You know when he's dancing?,1
RORY,Thank you.,1
DEAN,Hey.,1
RORY,I'll be right back.,1
RORY,Mom!,1
LORELAI,What?,1
RORY,What are you doing in here?,1
LORELAI,Trying to find the best bathing suit for my bust size.,1
RORY,Well get back in there!,1
LORELAI,Why? What happened? Did the bag boy try something?,1
RORY,He's sitting in there and he's watching the movie and he's perfect and he smells really good.,1
LORELAI,What?,1
RORY,He smells really good and he looks amazing and I am stupid. I said 'thank you.',1
LORELAI,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. You said 'thank you?'",1
RORY,When he kissed me.,1
LORELAI,He kissed you again? What is he just out of prison or something?,1
RORY,"No, not now. Yesterday. At the store.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, all right. Strike the prison comment. He kissed you and you said 'thank you?'",1
RORY,Yes.,1
LORELAI,Well that was very polite.,1
RORY,"No, it was stupid. And I don't know what I'm doing here. You're sitting in the kitchen. What kind of chaperone are you?",1
LORELAI,Me? I'm not trying to be a chaperone. I'm trying to be a girlfriend.,1
RORY,"Well switch gears, 'cause I'm freaking out here!",1
LORELAI,"You really like him, don't you?",1
RORY,Yeah.,1
LOREAI,"Well, OK, then. Just calm down.",1
RORY,I just don't want to do or say anything else that's gonna be remotely moronic.,1
LORELAI,I'm afraid once your heart is involved it all comes out in Moron.,1
RORY,Just please come back in.,1
LORELAI,OK. Let's go then.,1
RORY,Wait we can't go back in together though because that would be too obvious.,1
LORELAI,All right. OK. I'll go in first and you go to the bathroom.,1
RORY,OK. Good. Tell him I had to wash my face.,1
LORELAI,Yes. 'Cause of all the sugar you ate.,1
RORY,Yes! Good. Very good.,1
LORELAI,OK.,1
LORELAI,Hi. I'm back. Rory went to wash her face.,1
DEAN,"Oh, OK.",1
LORELAI,"Dean. I don't know exactly how to say this, but, um, this is a very different kind of household you walked into tonight.",1
DEAN,"Yeah, I know.",1
LORELAI,See...Rory is my daughter.,1
DEAN,Ah...here comes the talk.,1
LORELAI,"How about I talk, you listen? Rory is a smart kid. She's never been much for guys so the fact that she likes you means a lot. I don't believe she'd waste her time with some loser.",1
DEAN,But you're watching me.,1
LORELAI,"Sweetheart, the whole town is watching you. That girl in there is beloved around here. You hurt her, there's not a safe place within a hundred miles for you to hide. This is a very small, weird place you've moved to.",1
DEAN,I've noticed.,1
LORELAI,So just know all eyes are on you.,1
DEAN,Anything else?,1
LORELAI,She's not going on your motorcycle.,1
DEAN,I don't have a motorcycle.,1
LORELAI,She's not going on your motorcycle.,1
DEAN,"Fine, she won't go on my motorcycle.",1
LORELAI,"Curfew will be enforced. You will not detract from her schoolwork, and you're going to start handling those lemons better.",1
DEAN,What?,1
LORELAI,"Don't interrupt me w hen I'm speaking. I reserve the right to change, alter, tweak, or add to this list of rules at any given time w ithout any written notice. Am I clear?",1
DEAN,You're clear.,1
LORELAI,Good.,1
DEAN,My turn to speak?,1
LORELAI,"Fine, go ahead.",1
DEAN,You can lay on all the rules you want and you can have the whole town spy on me and stare at me an d chase me through the streets --,1
LORELAI,Oh I like the chase you through the streets idea.,1
DEAN,But I'm not going anywhere.,1
LORELAI,Well it's gonna be a short chase then isn't it?,1
DEAN,I need you not to hate me. If you hate me then I don't have a shot in hell with Rory.,1
LORELAI,Rory has her own mind.,1
DEAN,Yeah but you're her best friend and what you think means everything to her and you know that.,1
LORELAI,I wanna like you. 'Cause Rory likes you.,1
DEAN,But you don't.,1
LORELAI,I want to and I usually get what I want.,1
DEAN,Fair enough.,1
DEAN,She's taking a long time on her face.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, well, Rory's a perfectionist.",1
DEAN,Tell your mom thanks for inviting me.,1
RORY,I'm sorry if this was totally weird. I mean with my mom inviting you over and --,1
DEAN,"Hey, no, it was good. Really.",1
RORY,Really?,1
DEAN,Yeah.,1
DEAN,,1
LORELAI,So that went well.,1
RORY,"Yeah, not bad.",1
LORELAI,Did I humiliate you?,1
RORY,I don't know. What did you say to him when I went to the bathroom?,1
LORELAI,That you're pretty.,1
RORY,Liar.,1
LORELAI,Yeah...well.,1
RORY,I'm gonna go to bed.,1
RORY,"Mom, what's the matter?",1
LORELAI,Nothing.,1
RORY,"Yes there is. Come on, tell me.",1
LORELAI,Nothing. I just really wanted you to tell me about that kiss.,1
RORY,"I'm so sorry. I really wanted to, I swear. I just got scared and --",1
LORELAI,"I know. I'm not mad. I just wanted to hear about it. That's all. It's no big deal. It's OK, I'm fine. It's one too many Caramello bars. I'm sorry. You have school, I have work, so time for bed.",1
RORY,OK. Night.,1
LORELAI,"OK, night, hon.",1
RORY,Mom?,1
LORELAI,Hmm?,1
RORY,I know this is lame an d totally after the fact but --,1
LORELAI,Start from the beginning and you leave anything out you die! Where were you?,1
RORY,"OK, I was in the aisle where the ant spray is.",1
LORELAI,That's a good aisle.,1

TAYLORory,,1
PATTY,"Oh, Taylor, calm down.",1
TAYLORory,,1
PATTY,I promise that we hear you.,1
ANDREW,We've been hearing you for 20 minutes.,1
TAYLORory,"Well, excuse me Andrew, but some of us have businesses to run that don't involve peddling drug paraphernalia to kids.",1
ANDREW,"It was a lava lamp, Taylor.",1
TAYLORory,There is no use for a lava lamp unless you're on dr*gs.,1
ANDREW,,1
PATTY,"Now we've already agreed to look into your accusations, lets just move on. . . Lorelai : What did I miss?",1
RORY,Taylor Doose wants the no parking zone in front of his store removed. He says his customers are being unfairly ticketed.,1
LORELAI,"No, its just because he wants to park there all day.",1
RORY,Genius.,1
MAYORory,I have been mayor of this fine town for a long time. I tend to think of all of you as my children. Unfortunately sometimes children have to be disciplined. Now I'm going to say something and I'm only going to say it once. We have leash laws people.,1
Posted,12/26/00 04:16LORELAI : Daddy's getting angry.,1
MAYORory,Rover will not leash himself.,1
Rory,"Hm, good point.",1
MAYORory,I would like to now move on tom something of even greater importance. As you all know this coming Friday is the anniversary of the legendary battle of Stars Hollow. L : Where's Luke?,1
Rory,Up there.,1
MAYORory,Penny will be circulating a sign up sheet for those of you who would like to participate in the reenactment of foresaid battle. R : He's turning red.,1
MAYORory,"All right. It was a frigid November night, some 224 years ago. L : He's shifting in his seat",1
MAYORory,The brave stars hollow militia stood in wait for the Red Coats. R : He's adjusting the cap.,1
Lorelai,Ooh!,1
MAYORory,"Tired and Hungry, twelve proud men took their positions in the Town's Square, braving the elements . . . L : He's fighting the urge, he's fighting the urge.",1
MAYORory,. . .and immin ent death in their valiant efforts. . .,1
LUKE,"Oh for God's Sake, do we have to go through this every damn year!",1
Lorelai,Yesssss!,1
Rory,And the urge wins by a long shot.,1
LUKE,I thought we were here to discuss town issues.,1
TAYLORory,This is a town issue.,1
MAYORory,"Excuse me, who's talking?",1
LUKE,"Its me H arry, Luke, you've known me since I was 5 years old.",1
MAYORory,"Oh, Luke, yes. Sit down. Now as I was saying, twelve heroic men assembled with g*ns drawn ready to meet their maker.",1
LUKE,What are you talking about? Twelve guys stood in a row all night.,1
MAYORory,Waiting for the Red Coats.,1
LUKE,Who never showed!,1
MAYORory,Now just a minute!,1
LUKE,Twelve guys stood in a row all night waiting for an enemy that never showed. They got stood up. They should've been wearing prom dresses.,1

LUKE,Sit down Taylor.,1
TAYLORory,Menace.,1
LUKE,Suck up. L : Five bucks says somebody ends up in a headlock.,1
Rory,You're on!,1
LUKE,Have any of you ever considered the fact that you're glorifying a w*r we fought so we could keep land that we stole?,1
MAYORory,"If you don't like it here in America, why don't you go stand in line for toilet paper in the USSR.",1
LUKE,"There is no more USSR, Harry. L : A sense of community is so important isn't it?",1
Rory,Its what made our country great.,1
MAYORory,". . . .that is a known fact, is you're so interested in facts!",1
MAX,"Lorelai, it's Max. Medina. Maaaax Medina. And once again we miss each other. It's now 2 o'clock in the afternoon on Thursday and I'm in my office grading a paper entitled ""Emily",1
Dickinson,"Get a life."" Anyhow as I sit hear losing my faith in mankind, I wonder if we're ever gonna actually go on that date we talked about many moons ago. I teach a night class in Stamford twice a week, and when I pass that Stars Hollow sign on the turnpike, I think out there is a beautiful women that I someday hope to spend time w ith. Anyhow, I'm just thinking about you, and I don't know, maybe next week we can find some time. Goodbye Lorelai. Gilmore. You knew that. Okay, bye. Lorelai, it's Max. Medina. Maaaax Medina.

Lorelai,Can't you smell it?,1
Rory,"You know, its like dogs and high pitched noises. I think its something only you can smell.",1
Lorelai,I love snow.,1
Rory,"Really, I had no idea.",1
Lorelai,"Everything's magical when its snows, everything looks pretty. The clothes are great. Coats, scarves, gloves, hats.",1
Rory,"Thermal underwear, wool socks, ear flaps.",1
Lorelai,Do you know the best things in my life have happened when it snowed?,1
Rory,Why yes I do.,1
Rory,My best birthday.,1
Lorelai,Your first kiss.,1
Lorelai,"Your first steps, they all happened when it snowed.",1
Rory,Feet.,1
Lorelai,I feel good. Tingly.,1
Rory,That's called frostbite.,1
Lorelai,"Tsk. You are mocking your mother, the woman who birthed you.",1
Rory,I'm sorry.,1
Lorelai,"During a snowstorm, might I add.",1
Rory,So how soon is it supposed to hit?,1
Lorelai,Hmm. Tomorrow. Definitely tomorrow.,1
Rory,"Okay, then tomorrow it is.",1
Lorelai,What?,1
Rory,"You, me, donuts, coffee, standing out in a snowstorm. . .",1
Lorelai,At midnight?,1
Rory,At midnight.,1

Rory,So how many times are you gonna listen to that?,1
Lorelai,'Til it stops being sexy.,1
Rory,Stop! That's my teacher you're talking about! I have to respect him.,1
Lorelai,"Okay, well if it makes you feel any better, while he's being sexy, he's also being grammatically correct?",1
Rory,Better. Thank you.,1
Lorelai,Sorry I woke you up.,1
Rory,That's okay. Its all fodder for the tell all. Goodnight.,1
Lorelai,Goodnight.,1
MAX,,1
Lorelai,"Hey, how is it out there?",1
MICHELorelai,It is cold and gray like a fat dead pigeon.,1
Lorelai,"Oh, we'll need to pull out the sleds, people might want to sled. Ooh, and the parkas. We'll need the parkas.",1
MICHELorelai,For what?,1
Lorelai,In case anyone wants to hike.,1
MICHELorelai,You do know that not everyone finds the idea of being pelted with frozen water appealing.,1
Lorelai,"I know, and how sad for them.",1
MICHELorelai,"The thrilling sensation of getting lost in a blizzard, of freezing to death in the woods, and having to eat your friend's buttocks to stay alive, that is lost on many people.",1
Lorelai,"I am telling you, five minutes in a snowball fight we could knock that stick right out of your butt.",1
SOOKIE,Okay! How does this sound? Maple sugar snowflakes on all the pillows.,1
Lorelai,Oh that's sounds wonderful!,1
MICHELorelai,"Make them in the shape of a buttock, get people used to them.",1
SOOKIE,"Okay, is that a real suggestion?",1
Lorelai,"Sookie, please, who is speaking?",1
SOOKIE,"Michel, right, okay. Snowflakes it is!",1
LANE,"I just can't believe it. I mean, I sat next to him at practice for months, and then one day I look over and it's Rich. Rich Bloomingfeld.",1
RORY,"Where is my chemistry book? I had it at your house yesterday, didn't I?",1
LANE,"Rory, focus please.",1
RORY,I'm sorry. I just can't find my book.,1
Lorelai,Hey babe. Sergeant pepper.,1
Rory,"Mom, do you know where my. .",1
Lorelai,Big scary chemistry book is? Behind the desk.,1
Rory,Oh thank God.,1
Lorelai,Wow.,1
LANE,Yeah.,1
Rory,"So, is Sookie in the kitchen?",1
Lorelai,And there she'll stay.,1
Rory,"Okay, so where were we?",1
LANE,I just met my soul mate.,1
Rory,,1
SOOKIE,"Now rememb er you do not take your eyes off this for a minute 'cause the second you do it will boil and then it's ruined. So, just stand there and stare at it. Okay?",1
RORY,Hey Sookie!,1
SOOKIE,Hey kitty cats. Cinnamon buns are over there.,1
Rory,Do you have any of those rocky road cookies that you made yesterday?,1
SOOKIE,"I can scrounge some up. Lane, you need a bag?",1
LANE,No thank you.,1
SOOKIE,You staring?,1
CHEF,I'm staring.,1
SOOKIE,Thank you.,1
LANE,"So anyhow, Rich has this amazing hair.",1
Rory,Really?,1
LANE,"Oh my god. It's so perfect. It's thick but it's not too thick. And it's got really good natural wave, so he probably uses way less product than most guys.",1
Rory,"Always a plus. Hey, what time is it?",1
LANE,I don't know,1
Rory,I have to get to the bus stop. Dean's meeting me there.,1
LANE,But I'm trying to talk to you about this.,1
Rory,"I know, we'll talk on the way.",1
SOOKIE,Here you go.,1
Rory,Thank you Sookie.,1
Lorelai,"Hey sweets. I have a locksmith coming to the house today like five-ish, and I don't know how long it'll take, so will you tell grandma and grandpa that I'm gonna be late and that I'm having Satan's baby. You pick the order.",1
Rory,I'll relay the time mes sage but I'm leaving the rest up to you.,1
Lorelai,What is this? You hate rocky road cookies?,1
Rory,I do not.,1
Lorelai,Oh I'm sorry. That must be my other daughter Schmory.,1
Rory,We're leaving now.,1
Lorelai,Wait a minute. I know who likes rocky road cookies.,1
SOOKIE,Who?,1
Lorelai,Dean. They're for Dean.,1
SOOKIE,She's bringing baked goods to a boy. Wow. Serious!,1
Lorelai,"""Here Dean, these cookies are for you, 'cause you're keen.""",1
Rory,Stop.,1
SOOKIE,Rory's in love!,1

SOOKIE,But it's fun.,1
Lorelai,"Well, you're on your own.",1
SOOKIE,,1
LANE,"I just can't believe it. I mean, I've known him since the sixth grade, but suddenly he's different. He's not gangly anymore. You remember how gangly he was?",1
RORY,"I'm sorry, what?",1
LANE,You're not listening to me.,1
Rory,"I am, I'm sorry. I just couldn't find my bookmark. Okay. Go ahead.",1
LANE,"Okay, here are the problems facing the whole Bloomingfeld-Kim situation.",1
Rory,"One, hyphenation would be a pain.",1
LANE,"Two, he's my band partner. Romance would be completely awkward. Three, he's never even looked at me like I'm a girl or something resembling one. Four, there's no way I could convince my parents he was Korean. But I can't help it. I'm obsessed. Did I tell you about his hair?",1
Rory,"It's on his head, right?",1
DEAN,Hi.,1
Rory,Hi!,1
DEAN,Lane.,1
LANE,Dean.,1
DEAN,Nice hat. Here.,1
Rory,"Oh, how'd you like it?",1
DEAN,"Well, I could tell you, but then I'd have to k*ll you.",1
Rory,"Aha! You liked it! You liked Jane Austen. I knew you would! Lane, Dean likes Jane Austen.",1
LANE,"Wow, who would've thought.",1
Rory,"I told him he would. But he was all, forget Jane Austen, you have to read Hunter Thompson.",1
DEAN,You do have to read Hunter Thompson.,1
Rory,Not as much as you needed to read Jane Austen.,1
DEAN,"Yeah, yeah. Hey what's that?",1
Rory,Just some cookies.,1
DEAN,Rocky Road.,1
Rory,Yeah.,1
DEAN,"Wow, she brings me cookies. How can I repay her?",1
Rory,How about a little Charlotte Bronte?,1
DEAN,How about something else?,1
Rory,That's good too.,1
LANE,"Okay, I gotta go. I am going to be late for homeroom, and I have that perfect attendance certificate in my sights.",1
RORY,See you later.,1
LANE,"Yeah, see ya. INDEPENDENCE INN",1
Lorelai,"Ladies and Gentlemen, we have flakes. Flakes have been sighted. Flakage, if you will, has begun. Michel, it's the first snowfall of the season. It's very lucky. Make a wish.",1
MICHELorelai,Get away from me.,1
Lorelai,"Oh, you're not supposed to say it out loud.",1
Lorelai,The world changes when it snows. It gets quiet. Everything softens.,1
MICHELorelai,It's your mother.,1
Lorelai,And then the rain comes. Hi Mom.,1
EMILY,Have you seen the news?,1
Lorelai,Ever?,1
EMILY,A bad storm is heading your way. It's already hitting us here.,1
Lorelai,"Well, don't panic. Ill get the ark. You get the animals.",1
EMILY,"I just sent Lance to pick up Rory at school. The roads are terrible, black ice everywhere, it's just a mess out there. I hate this kind of weather. So anyhow, what time will you get here?",1
Lorelai,"Well, uh, gee mom, I don't know, let me see. Black ice, treacherous roads. I guess I'll just put on my red, white, and blue leotard, grab my golden lasso and fly the invisible plane on over.",1
EMILY,You're not coming?,1
Lorelai,"Well, if it's as bad as you say it is, I don't see how I'd get there.",1
EMILY,"Well, I guess it'll just be the three of us then.",1
Lorelai,I guess so.,1
EMILY,"And you know, Rory should probably spend the night tonight also.",1
Lorelai,Okay.,1
EMILY,And if it's still bad tomorrow. .,1
Lorelai,"Mom, why do you wait to see what the weather does before you fill out a change of address card for her.",1
Rory,Hey Grandma.,1
EMILY,Rory's here.,1
Lorelai,Put her on a sec.,1
EMILY,It's your mother.,1
Rory,Hey.,1
Lorelai,"Hi. Things bad out there, huh?",1
Rory,"It's crazy. There's snow coming down everywhere. And let me just tell you, saddle shoes are not the best all weather footwear.",1
Lorelai,Aw. You fell.,1
Rory,Twice.,1
Lorelai,Yikes. I'm sorry.,1
Rory,So what's the deal? Are you coming over tonight?,1
Lorelai,"No, I guess I'm pretty much stuck in the Hollow tonight.",1
Rory,"Bummer . Well, we can take our snow walk tomorrow night?",1
Lorelai,"Absolutely. All right, now, honey, tell Grandma that you arrived there not a member of the junior league, I'd like you to leave the same w ay.",1
Rory,Call if you get lonely.,1
Lorelai,,1
LUKE,"Harry, come on, stop this before somebody drives through town and thinks the local mental institution has bad padlocks.",1
HARRY,"Luke, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. Your father was a reenactor.",1
LUKE,"Yes, and I thought he was crazy also.",1
TAYLORory,Who's stepping on my musket?,1
KIRK,That would be me.,1
TAYLORory,"Well, stop it.",1
LORELAI,"There goes the fire chief, the police chief and the one paramedic with a valid license. I feel safe, don't you?",1
LUKE,"Look at them, all relatively intelligent men, but there they are dressed up in costumes, standing out in a snowstorm and for what?",1
Lorelai,Because it's tradition.,1
LUKE,"Tradition is a trap, it allows people to stick their head in the sand. Everything that passed was so quaint, so charming. Times were simpler. Kids didn't have sex. Neighbors knew each other. It's a freaking fairy tale. Things sucked then too. It just sucked without indoor plumbing.",1
Lorelai,I think some traditions are nice. Birthdays. Holidays. Taking a walk in the first snow of the season.,1
LUKE,I didn't get the Hallmark card for that one.,1
Lorelai,"When I was five, I had a really bad ear infection and I had been home in bed for a week and I was very sad. So I wished really hard that something wonderful would happen to me. And I woke up the next morning and it had snowed. And I was sure that some fairy godmother had done it just for me. It was my little present.",1
LUKE,Your parents never explained the concept of weather to you?,1
Lorelai,"I'm mak ing a point, Mouthy McGee. Of course, many years later, I realized that logically, the snow was not there for me personally. But, still, when it snows, something inside me says, 'hey that's your present.' I don't think it'll ever change.",1
LUKE,My father used to be one of those guys.,1
Lorelai,Yeah?,1
LUKE,"Yeah, even had his own musket.",1
Lorelai,Really.,1
LUKE,Never had to rent it.,1
Lorelai,Where is the musket now?,1
LUKE,He was buried with it.,1
Lorelai,Wow.,1
LUKE,Yup. He loved that musket.,1
Lorelai,That's nice. . . in a disturbing sort of way.,1
LUKE,"Come on in, I'll get you some coffee.",1
Lorelai,,1
TEACHERory,,1
LORELAI,I smell snow.,1
MAX,Well well well.,1
Lorelai,What's up Teach?,1
MAX,What are you doing here?,1
Lorelai,I live here. What are you doing here?,1
MAX,"I was on my way back from Stamford, and my car decided to stop.",1
Lorelai,Here?,1
MAX,Yes.,1
Lorelai,In my town?,1
MAX,Yes.,1
Lorelai,Good car.,1
MAX,Its nice to see you.,1
Lorelai,You too.,1
MAX,"You know, a minute ago, I was really angry about something and now I just can't remember what it was.",1
Lorelai,Well that's snow for you.,1
MAX,I guess so.,1
Lorelai,"So, this is quite a predicament you're in. Stranded here in a strange town with no one you know. Oh wait. . .",1
MAX,Where's Rory tonight?,1
Lorelai,She's in Hartford with her grandparents.,1
MAX,That must be nice.,1
Lorelai,Whatever you say.,1
MAX,So Rory's in Hartford.,1
Lorelai,Yes.,1
MAX,And I'm in Stars Hollow.,1
Lorelai,Correct.,1
MAX,And you are. . . .,1
Lorelai,Trying to figure out where I should take you.,1
MAX,"No, no, no, no, where I should take you.",1
Lorelai,This is my town. You know nothing around here.,1
MAX,"No, but I was the one who asked you out initially, so therefore I am still obligated to do the taking.",1
Lorelai,"Yes, but I was the one who did the canceling after you did the asking, therefore you forfeit yourtaking rights to me, the cancellor.",1
MAX,So we're actually gonna do this?,1
Lorelai,Yes we are.,1
MAX,Let me just give this guy my keys and we'll go.,1
Lorelai,Great.,1
MAX,,1
EMILY,"Well, I just don't understand why you waited so late to call. . . Are you sure? . . . .Fine. . .All right, yes, goodbye. Well, I don't know what I'm going to do now.",1
RICHARD,What's the problem Emily?,1
EMILY,The problem is that apparently Florence cannot get here because of the storm.,1
RICHARD,Florence?,1
EMILY,Our cook.,1
RICHARD,"Ah. Well, we'll just have to go out then.",1
EMILY,"Oh, please Richard, pay attention. We can't go out. It's miserable out there.",1
RICHARD,"Well, we'll figure something out then.",1
EMILY,What? What will we figure out?,1
RICHARD,"Well, I don't know but. . .",1
EMILY,I hate the damn snow.,1
RICHARD,"Emily, calm down.",1
EMILY,This is a serious problem. These Friday dinners are the only proper food that child eats all week.,1
RICHARD,"Rory, are you in any way malnourished or in need of some international relief organization to recruit a celebrity to raise money on your account?",1
Rory,I'm good.,1
RICHARD,"She's good, Emily.",1
EMILY,Your sense of humor rears it's ugly head at the oddest of times Richard.,1
RICHARD,"Emily, I am not the mastermind behind some great scheme to spoil your dinner plans and I don't care to be treated as such.",1
EMILY,"So you're fine with having no dinner tonight, is that it?",1
RICHARD,I certainly am not.,1
Rory,"Hey, how about I check the fridge? I'm sure there's something in there we could whip up.",1
EMILY,Whip up?,1
Rory,"Yeah, come on. It'll be fun, I promise.",1
EMILY,,1
EMILY,Nothing.,1
RICHARD,Not a blessed thing.,1
RORY,"Hey, there's frozen pizza.",1
EMILY,How in the world did that get there?,1
Rory,Maybe you bought it and forgot about it.,1
EMILY,I have never bought frozen pizza. It must belong to Anna.,1
RICHARD,The maid.,1
EMILY,Yes.,1
RICHARD,"Ah, got one.",1
EMILY,What are you doing?,1
Rory,I'm gonna make it.,1
EMILY,"Oh, Rory, you're not serious.",1
RICHARD,That hardly looks like dinner.,1
EMILY,"I agree. Rory, that's food you eat at a carnival. Or in a Turkish prison.",1
Rory,I promise you're gonna love it.,1
EMILY,But. . .,1
Rory,"Listen, just leave it up to me. You guys go back into the living room and I'll call you when it's ready. . . . . Hey Grandma?",1
EMILY,Yes,1
Rory,What are the odds of you knowing where a cookie sheet would be?,1
RICHARD,I'd say very slim.,1
Rory,Never mind. I'll find it.,1
EMILY,,1
Lorelai,Thank you. Hold that. Thanks.,1
MAX,Thanks.,1
Lorelai,"God, it's a beautiful night, huh?",1
MAX,Yes it is.,1
Lorelai,"So, tell me something about yourself.",1
MAX,Like what?,1
Lorelai,"Uh, have you ever been married?",1
MAX,Nope.,1
Lorelai,Ever been close.,1
MAX,Once.,1
Lorelai,And?,1
MAX,She's in Thailand now.,1
Lorelai,Sex trade?,1
MAX,Bank of America.,1
Lorelai,"Well, it's usually either one or the other.",1
MAX,"She went there on business, she did well, she never came back.",1
Lorelai,"Aw, sad.",1
MAX,"Well, it was at the time, but if it was meant to be . . .",1
Lorelai,"Ah, he believes in fate.",1
MAX,"Fate, poetry, love. They all go together don't they?",1
Lorelai,"Yes, they do.",1
MAX,How about you?,1
Lorelai,"Oh, I've never been married.",1
MAX,Ever been close?,1
Lorelai,"Uh, Rory's dad proposed.",1
MAX,What happened?,1
Lorelai,The bell rang? I was late for chem lab?,1
MAX,Ever sorry that you didn't?,1
Lorelai,"Oh, no. We were so young, and my life would've been completely different. You know, I wouldn't live here, I wouldn't work here, I wouldn't be walking here with you.",1
MAX,Where are we going?,1
Lorelai,You'll see.,1
MAX,Are we gonna get there before we freeze?,1
Lorelai,"Now, what kind of fun would it be if I told you the answer.",1
MAX,You're crazy.,1
Lorelai,Very possible,1
MAX,And I'm following you.,1
Lorelai,"Yes, you are.",1
MAX,So possibly I'm crazier than you are.,1
Lorelai,"Again, very possible.",1
MAX,A match made in heaven.,1
Lorelai,Or in Bellevue.,1
MAX,,1
RORY,Hello?,1
LANE,Rory?,1
Rory,Lane?,1
LANE,Where are you?,1
Rory,I'm at my grandparents. What are you doing at my house?,1
LANE,Like you care.,1
Rory,What are you talking about?,1
LANE,You're never around when I need you.,1
Rory,Well you know I have to go to my grandparents on Fridays.,1
LANE,I know. You go to your grandparents. You go to Chilton. You have to meet Dean. He needs his cookies. I can't find my books.,1
Rory,What are you talking about?,1
LANE,What good is it to have a best friend when she's never around and she never listens and she has no interest in the fact that you're in love or that you touched his hair.,1
Rory,You touched whose hair?,1
LANE,Rich. Bloomingfeld.,1
Rory,Why would you touch Rich Bloomingfeld's hair?,1
LANE,Why? That's a good question. I don't know why. Why would a sane person do a thing like that? Maybe I'm not sane. Maybe I'm going through some sort of phase. Maybe I really really needed someone to talk to about this and you weren't there.,1
Rory,"Lane, come on.",1
LANE,"No, you come on. You're always at school or you're talking about school or you're with Dean. You have everything now and I have nothing except for 2000 Korean bibles and a potential 'F' in jazz band.",1
Rory,I'm sorry.,1
LANE,Don't be sorry. Be here.,1
RORY,I . . .Lane? Are you there?,1
LANE,Rory? Rory?,1
RORY,Lane?,1
EMILY,There you are.,1
Rory,I think the phones went dead.,1
EMILY,It's probably just this horrible storm. You must come downstairs immediately.,1
Rory,What's wrong?,1
EMILY,The stove is buzzing.,1
Rory,It's just the timer Grandma.,1
EMILY,I know it's the timer Rory. What I don't know is where its located or how to turn it off.,1
RORY,But I really need to call Lane back.,1
EMILY,There's nothing you can do now. The phones will come back on eventually. Now please come downstairs and help me stop the buzzing.,1
Rory,But. . .,1
RICHARD,"Emily, for heaven's sake get down here!",1
Rory,,1
Lorelai,"So, the fiesta burger. .",1
MAX,Very interesting.,1
Lorelai,Very spicy.,1
MAX,Oh yeah.,1
Lorelai,How's your tongue?,1
MAX,"Much better, thank you.",1
Lorelai,Are you scared yet?,1
MAX,Not yet.,1
Lorelai,Are you scared yet?,1
MAX,Still good.,1
Lorelai,Are you scared yet?,1
MAX,"You know, you're very annoying in a movie.",1
Lorelai,I know. I think it's very important that you know my faults as well as my many attributes.,1
MAX,Very thoughtful of you.,1
Lorelai,"It is, isn't it?",1
MAX,"Because as you know, you can get very carried away by your many attributes, suddenly findyourself thinking, my god, this women is absolutely perfect.",1
Lorelai,"We wouldn't want that now, would we?",1
MAX,,1
Rory,You wanna eat it before it gets cold. How is it?,1
EMILY,Not cold!,1
RICHARD,"Mmmm. It's quite tasty. Emily, we should have this more often.",1
EMILY,What?,1
RICHARD,Perhaps instead of that horrible salmon that keeps showing up.,1
EMILY,That salmon is a fine delicacy.,1
RICHARD,"Mm, potato, po-tah-to.",1
Rory,"Try it again Grandma, it's probably cooler now.",1
EMILY,"No, thank you, I'm fine.",1
Rory,"You know what? It's really good if you add some extra Parmesan on it. This is mom's special trick. Frozen pizza is a staple at our house. Mom's become a majo r doctoring genius. She'll put anything on it. One time Sookie came and brought us some foie gras, and mom stuck it on a pizza.",1
EMILY,How was it?,1
Rory,"Pretty good once we took the foie gras off. Okay, that's good. Try it. Please. If you wanna get really crazy you can pick it up.",1
EMILY,"Well, all right. Here goes nothing. Mmm! That's wonderful!",1
Rory,See?,1
EMILY,"Rory pass me that cheese. Trust me, it makes all the difference.",1
Rory,I'll be right back. I found this in mom's room.,1
EMILY,What's that?,1
Rory,Pictures.,1
EMILY,"Oh my goodness, I haven't seen that in years.",1
RICHARD,Oh my gosh.,1
EMILY,Ah. Look at this,1
Rory,That's one fluffy white dress.,1
EMILY,"Yes. There were 12 petticoats underneath it. We got it in London, remember Richard?",1
RICHARD,Uh yeah.,1
Rory,She looks like a little princess,1
EMILY,"Yes, well, if memo ry serves about two minutes after that picture was taken her highness dumped a glass of grape juice all over it.",1
RICHARD,"Look Emily, it's Hopey.",1
Rory,Hopey?,1
EMILY,My younger sister.,1
Rory,Has she ever been here when I was here? I don't remember her.,1
RICHARD,"Oh, she lives in Paris. Our great ex patriot.",1
EMILY,"Oh my Hopey, look at you. I haven't seen her in such a long time.",1
RICHARD,Maybe we should take a trip this year.,1
EMILY,That would be nice.,1
RICHARD,Maybe Rory could go with us.,1
Rory,I'll start packing tomorrow. Oh is that you guys?,1
RICHARD,Yes it is.,1
EMILY,That is our wedding picture.,1
Rory,It's an amazing dress.,1
EMILY,It should've been. My mother had three seamstresses working around the clock making it.,1
Rory,Do you still have it?,1
EMILY,Its upstairs packed away somewhere. I'll save it for you if you like.,1
RICHARD,"Oh Emily, Rory's too young to be thinking about things like that.",1
EMILY,"Oh, Richard, please. Every young girl thinks about her wedding. I know I did. I knew from the time I was twelve that I wanted lilies and orchids with a silver bow wrapped around them for my bouquet.",1
RICHARD,You also knew that you wanted to marry Errol Flynn.,1
Rory,Really? Grandma had a thing for the pirate guy?,1
EMILY,I did not have a thing for the pirate guy.,1
RICHARD,She was mad about him. She even tried to get me to grow one of those little mustaches.,1
Rory,You're kidding.,1
EMILY,Richard stop.,1
RICHARD,She wanted me to swing from a chandelier.,1
EMILY,Now you're just being silly.,1
RICHARD,Luckily I was on the fencing team in college or I would've married Lucinda Lester by now.,1
EMILY,Actually Lucinda Lester looked a lot like Errol Flynn. I should've married her; it would've been very modern of me.,1
Rory,Wow. Mom looks really beautiful here.,1
EMILY,Yes she does.,1
Rory,What was the occasion?,1
RICHARD,Who would like some coffee?,1
EMILY,That was her debutante gown for her coming out party.,1
Rory,Mom had a coming out party?,1
RICHARD,No she didn't.,1
RORY,Oh.,1
EMILY,"Yes, well, things happen don't they?",1
RICHARD,"Excuse me, I have some business calls to make.",1
EMILY,,1
LUKE,Here.,1
HARRY,What is this?,1
LUKE,I brought you coffee.,1
HARRY,"No, thank you.",1
LUKE,"Harry, you're freezing. Take the damn coffee.",1
HARRY,"When our forefathers stood out here many moons ago, they didn't have any coffee.",1
LUKE,How do you know? Do you have written documentation of about what sort of beverages they did or did not have on that long historic night of standing?,1
HARRY,This is still a joke to you young man. I don't choose to be a joke. We don't need your coffee.,1
LUKE,"Harry, please, take the coffee. My father would've taken the coffee.",1
HARRY,"Well, all right then, thank you.",1
LUKE,Andrew?,1
ANDREW,Thank you Luke.,1
LUKE,Kirk?,1
Kirk,You got any herbal tea?,1
LUKE,"Not on me, but I can get some.",1
KIRK,With a squeeze of lemon?,1
LUKE,Okay. GUY 1: I could really go for some cocoa. GUY 2: Oh that sounds good. Cocoa for me too.,1
LUKE,"Okay, okay, hang on a minute. One herbal tea, and two cocoas.",1
MAX,Yeah that part was a little slow.,1
LORELAI,Slow?,1
MAX,,1
Lorelai,"So this is it, my house.",1
MAX,Its nice,1
Lorelai,Thank you.,1
MAX,Good porch. Nice windows. Front door. Which opens I assume.,1
Lorelai,Yeah.,1
MAX,Something wrong?,1
Lorelai,"No, nothings wrong.",1
MAX,Are you sure?,1
Lorelai,"Uh, yeah. See, I was so excited about the snow and about seeing you.",1
MAX,Thank you.,1
Lorelai,"You're welcome. That I didn't really think this thing out and I usually think this kind of thing out, so I'm just thinking this thing out.",1
MAX,What thing?,1
Lorelai,Inviting a man over to my house.,1
MAX,Okay.,1
Lorelai,"See I have really strict rules about dating. I keep my personal life totally separate from my life with Rory. You know, I never want her to feel unsettled or like her life could just shift at any moment.",1
MAX,I totally understand.,1
Lorelai,"And she comes first, and this is her house too and . . .",1
MAX,I understand. This is something that you don't do often.,1
Lorelai,Ever.,1
MAX,Ever?,1
Lorelai,Never.,1
MAX,I see.,1
Lorelai,"I mean, I've dated, and you know, dated, but I've just never dated, here in our house.",1
MAX,"What if I promised you that if you let me in, all I'm expecting is a cup of coffee. That's it. Nothing weird or funny. Unless of course you're into weird and funny . .",1
Lorelai,Max!,1
MAX,"'Cause I can do weird and funny. Lorelai, I've been enjoying the hell out of myself tonight and I think you are too.",1
Lorelai,I am.,1
MAX,"Well, so it's snowing, cold, and your daughter is elsewhere.",1
Lorelai,I know. I know,1
MAX,I mean this whole night has been a weird chismin of events.,1
Lorelai,Oh it's that fate guy again.,1
MAX,At some point in your life you're gonna have to decide that some guy is worth opening that door for. I am just volunteering.,1
LORELAI,,1
Lorelai,How strong do you like your coffee because I've built up such a tolerance to it I usually make it too intense for most people.,1
MAX,"Yeah, yeah, I've lived through the fiesta burger, don't hold back now.",1
Lorelai,Okay.,1
MAX,Can I help?,1
Lorelai,"Um, yeah, you can fill up the pot.",1
MAX,"Oh, I'm very good at that. Six cups sounds good?",1
Lorelai,"Fine, what are you gonna have?",1
MAX,You do know that was a leading question right?,1
Lorelai,Really how so? How badly do you want that coffee?,1
MAX,Not that badly.,1
Lorelai,Such a good answer.,1
MAX,How many kids did you say you have?,1
Lorelai,"One. Why? Lane! Hi, hi. We're just, uh, what are you doing here?",1
LANE,"I'm sorry. I was waiting for Rory. I'll just go back into her room and I won't come back out, I promise.",1
Lorelai,"Oh, that's the Cure. I have to go back in there.",1
MAX,"Its okay, Ill finish up the coffee.",1
Lorelai,I'll be back as fast as humanly possible.,1
MAX,,1
Lorelai,Hey.,1
LANE,Sorry I messed up your date.,1
Lorelai,Ah you didn't mess up your date. What's going on?,1
LANE,I was waiting for Rory to get home.,1
Lorelai,"Sweetie, Rory's stuck in Hartford tonight.",1
LANE,Oh I didn't know. Ill just go,1
Lorelai,"Hey, do you wanna talk? I'm not Rory, but we do use the same blow dryer.",1
LANE,I did something really stupid today,1
Lorelai,"Okay, what'd you pierce?",1
LANE,Nothing. I touched a boy's hair.,1
Lorelai,Okay.,1
LANE,A boy I really like.,1
Lorelai,So far missing the stupid part.,1
LANE,I kind of did it without his permission.,1
Lorelai,Now we're getting somewhere.,1
LANE,"I don't know what happened. I mean, I was just standing there and then he bends over and his hair falls forward and suddenly its like my hand had a life of its own.",1
Lorelai,Sounds like your hand had a little help from your hormones,1
LANE,God I'm so humiliated. I can't ever go back to school. I'll have to be home schooled. My mother finally gets her way.,1
Lorelai,Look at it from a different perspective. You have so many years of screw-ups ahead of you. View this as a trial run for really grownup humiliation.,1
LANE,So not helping.,1
Lorelai,Maybe you should be a hairdresser.,1
LANE,Lorelai!,1
Lorelai,Yes its perfect. Then you can run your hands though anybody's hair you want and they'll pay you for it.,1
LANE,What am I going to do? Everyone at school's gonna be talking about me. I can't show my face.,1
Lorelai,"Everyone does stupid things in high school, it's like a requirement.",1
LANE,Not like this.,1
Lorelai,"No, some people get pregnant. Talk about something really juicy for the gossip mill.",1
LANE,I forgot about that,1
Lorelai,"Yeah, everybody screws up Lane. That's what happens. It's what you do with the screw-ups, it's how you handle the experience, that's what you should judge yourself by. I have a great life and an amazing kid. And I took a detour, I ended up some place good.",1
LANE,Yeah.,1
Lorelai,Tell me this. How did his hair feel? As good as it looked?,1
LANE,Better.,1
Lorelai,"Oh, you're gonna be fine. I'm positive about that.",1
LANE,Thank you.,1
Lorelai,You're welcome.,1
LANE,So who's the guy?,1
Lorelai,Rory's teacher.,1
LANE,"Oh, he has nice hair.",1
Lorelai,,1
Lorelai,Hey.,1
MAX,Hey. Everything okay in there?,1
Lorelai,It will be.,1
MAX,So where did we leave off?,1
Lorelai,"Oh, Lane is gonna stay here tonight. She had a really bad teen day and needs to crash someplace sympathetic.",1
MAX,"Okay, I understand.",1
Lorelai,"I swear to God, if this wasn't a major Judy Blume moment, I'd kick her cute little butt right out of here.",1
MAX,Can you recommen d a hotel that really really close to here?,1
Lorelai,Why don't you just stay here tonight? Everybody else is.,1
MAX,"Oh, I don't know.",1
Lorelai,"Really, the couch is comfortable, there's pillows and blankets, and the bathroom's through there. The kitchen has nothing in it but running water if you get thirsty and. . . . it's an awful night.",1
MAX,"Okay, if it's not a problem.",1
Lorelai,Not at all.,1
MAX,Can I at least give you a kiss goodnight?,1
Lorelai,Only if you intend to live till morning.,1
MAX,Goodnight.,1
Lorelai,,1
Lorelai,Hi.,1
Rory,Hi. What's up?,1
Lorelai,"Nothing, what's up with you?",1
Rory,You have something to tell me.,1
Lorelai,"Boy you're so smart. Right, okay, here we go. I've got a boy in the house.",1
Rory,You what?,1
Lorelai,"Nothing happened, I swear, he slept the whole night on the couch. And you know him.",1
Rory,I do?,1
Lorelai,,1
Rory,Its Mr. Medina.,1
Lorelai,I know.,1
Rory,My English teacher is on my couch.,1
Lorelai,,1
Lorelai,"Rory talk to me, how do you feel?",1
Rory,I don't know.,1
Lorelai,"Take a guess. Angry, frustrated, nauseous?",1
Rory,Weird. I feel weird. Has he been here all night?,1
Lorelai,Pretty much.,1
Rory,Oh my God. Did he go into the bathroom? I have stuff hanging in there!,1
Lorelai,"Honey, you knew I was gonna date him, right? This isn't a total surprise.",1
Rory,Yes I knew you were gonna date. I just didn't expect him to be here . . at our house . . .in the morning.,1
Lorelai,I know.,1
Rory,I don't rememb er ever there being a man in our house.,1
Lorelai,"Yeah, well I kind of broke the rules.",1
Rory,"God, why is this so weird for me?",1
Lorelai,Because I should've told you first.,1
Rory,No.,1
Lorelai,Because I should have talked to you before I did this.,1
Rory,No.,1
Lorelai,Because you're afraid he smushed the couch pillows out of shape?,1
Rory,Do you love him?,1
Lorelai,"I. .We had one date. It was a great date. World Series level. But it was just a date. Honey, I promised myself a long time ag o that I was gonna keep all this stuff separate from you and I want you to know that that still stands. Okay, this was a one-time thing. I'm not gonna start just bringing guys home. This is not a trend.",1
Rory,You can you know.,1
Lorelai,What?,1
Rory,"Bring guys home. I mean, if you like someone you should feel comfortable doing that.",1
Lorelai,I appreciate that.,1
Rory,I want you to be happy.,1
Lorelai,And I love you for that.,1
Rory,Plus I know you're not a cat person so you truly will be alone if you don't find someone.,1
Lorelai,"Okay, look, someday I will bring someone home but when I do I just wanna be sure it's THE guy.",1
Rory,Mr. Medina's not THE guy?,1
Lorelai,"I don't know, he might be. But right now it's just you and me. And sometimes Lane.",1
LANE,Hey,1
Rory,Hey,1
Lorelai,I'm gonna go wake the man up.,1
LANE,Your mom let me spend the night here.,1
Rory,I tried calling you back all night but the phones didn't turn back on until this morning.,1
LANE,"Its okay, I understand.",1
Rory,"Lane I'm so sorry, I've been the worst friend lately.",1
LANE,"No, I just wigged out a little. I get jealous sometimes. I mean, you seem to have this really great life and I don't really fit in there.",1
Rory,"That's not true, you totally fit in.",1
LANE,Yeah?,1
Rory,I'm talking Legos.,1
LANE,I hope so.,1
Rory,"I will be better from now on, I promise. Twenty-four hours a day at your disposal.",1
LANE,Dean'll love that.,1
Rory,"Well, he'll have to, you came first.",1
LANE,"That's right. I got dibs. Okay, I have to go home.",1
Rory,"Coffee at Luke's, 2 o'clock?",1
LANE,You're on.,1
Rory,And I wanna hear all about that hair touching incident.,1
LANE,Yeah and I wanna hear the rest of the teacher on the couch incident.,1

EMILY,Your grandfather called last night and told me to let you know he's bringing you back something very special from Prague.,1
RORY,"Wow, Prague. How amazing is it that he's going to Prague?",1
EMILY,"It's supposed to be lovely, very dramatic castles everywhere.",1
RORY,Did you know the cell that Václav Havel was held in is now a hostel? You can stay there for like $50 a night.,1
RORY,"Hey, maybe on our big trip to Europe we could go to Prague and stay in his cell.",1
LORELAI,Absolutely. And then we can go to Turkey and stay in that place from Midnight Express.,1
EMILY,"Lorelai, what are you doing?",1
LORELAI,Getting rid of the avacado.,1
EMILY,Since when do you not like avacado?,1
LORELAI,"Since the day I said, ""Gross. What is this?"" and you said, ""Avacado.""",1
EMILY,I'm focusing on you now. Tell me all about the Chilton formal next week.,1
LORELAI,There's a formal?,1
RORY,How do you know about the formal?,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, how do you know about the formal?",1
EMILY,I read my Chilton newsletter.,1
LORELAI,Since when do you get a Chilton newsletter?,1
EMILY,Well as a major contributor to Rory's education I figured I had the right to ask for a newsletter to be sent to my house.,1
Posted,01/01/01 22:06,1
LORELAI,Are you serious?,1
EMILY,"And it's a good thing, too, since you don't bother to read yours. One of us should be up to date on the goings-on at Rory's school.",1
LORELAI,"Hey, Mom, I read my newsletter.",1
EMILY,You did?,1
LORELAI,That's right.,1
EMILY,What was the picture on the cover?,1
LORELAI,It was a picture of a really rich kid in plaid.,1
EMILY,It was a spotted owl.,1
LORELAI,In plaid.,1
EMILY,"The owls are endangered and Chilton is taking donations to help them. You gave a very nice one, in case you're interested.",1
LORELAI,"Mom, don't be giving donations on Rory's behalf. I'll do that.",1
EMILY,How can you do that when you don't bother to read the newsletter?,1
LORELAI,I read the newsletter.,1
EMILY,You didn't know they were taking donations.,1
LORELAI,It's a private school. They're always taking donations. They teach a class in it. I'll get them next time.,1
EMILY,Well what about the owls?,1
LORELAI,They'll live.,1
EMILY,"Well apparently they won't, dear. That's why they need the donations in the first place.",1
LORELAI,"So, you have a formal coming up?",1
RORY,"Yeah, but I don't think I'm going to go.",1
EMILY,Nonsense. Of course you're going.,1
LORELAI,"Mom, if Rory doesn't want to go she doesn't have to go.",1
EMILY,Well I don't understand why she wouldn't want to go.,1
LORELAI,I know you don't.,1
RORY,I'm gonna go get another Coke.,1
EMILY,What did you say to her?,1
LORELAI,What are you talking about?,1
EMILY,If she doesn't want to go it must be because of something you said.,1
LORELAI,"Mom, I promise. All I ever said to her about dances is that you go, you dance, you have punch, you eat, you take a picture, and then you get auctioned off to a biker g*ng from Sausalito.",1
EMILY,"Lorelai, this is serious.",1
LORELAI,"Mom, I said nothing, OK? Rory's disdain of formals is totally her own. Let's just drop it, please.",1
EMILY,Fine.,1
LORELAI,Fine.,1
EMILY,What's wrong with the tomato?,1
LORELAI,It was fraternizing with the enemy.,1
LORELAI,Why didn't you mention the dance?,1
RORY,'Cause I'm not going.,1
LORELAI,Oh. But why aren't you going?,1
RORY,'Cause I hate dances.,1
LORELAI,Good answer. Except you've never actually been to a dance.,1
RORY,So?,1
LORELAI,So you really have nothing to compare it to.,1
RORY,"No, but I can imagine it.",1
LORELAI,"That's true. However, not really, since you've never actually been to one you're basing all your dance opinions on one midnight viewing of Sixteen Candles.",1
RORY,So?,1
LORELAI,So you should have a decent reason for hating something before you really decide you hate it.,1
RORY,"Trust me, I'll hate it. It'll be stuffy and boring, the music will suck and since none of the kids at school like me, I'll be stuck in the back listening to 98° watching Tristin and Paris argue over which one of them gets to make me mis erable first.",1
LORELAI,OK. Or it'll be all sparkly and exciting and you'll be standing on the dance floor listening to Tom Waits with some great-looking guy staring at you so hard that you don't even realize that Paris and Tristin have just been eaten by bears.,1
RORY,What guy?,1
LORELAI,I don't know -- maybe the guy who hangs out in our trees all day waiting for you to come home?,1
RORY,Dean does not hang out in trees.,1
LORELAI,He bashed his head on a branch last week when I came out of the house too quickly.,1
RORY,Why do you care all of sudden if I go?,1
LORELAI,I don't care if you go. I just don't want you to miss any experience because you're too afraid.,1
RORY,I'm afraid? Of what?,1
LORELAI,Of asking Dean. Of him saying 'no.' Of going to a dance with a bunch of kids who haven't accepted you yet. Of dancing in public. Of finding out you should never be dancing in public.,1
RORY,"OK, OK, I get it.",1
LORELAI,"Listen, I know you are not Miss Party Girl, and I love you for that, but sometimes I wonder -- do you not join in because you really don't want to or because you're too shy? If the reason you don't want to go is because you really don't want to go and not because you are in any way afraid, then this is the last time I'll mention it, I promise.",1
RORY,I don't have a dress.,1
LORELAI,I could make you one.,1
RORY,Really?,1
LORELAI,Oh yeah. We could get some great shoes and some new earrings. You could get your hair done.,1
RORY,You won't think I'm an idiot?,1
LORELAI,Depends on what hairstyle you choose. This dance could be great for you.,1
RORY,He's gonna say no.,1
LANE,Why would he say no.,1
RORY,Why would he say yes?,1
LANE,"Rory, listen to me. There's absolutely no point in having a boyfriend if you can't get him to go to the dance with you.",1
RORY,He's not my boyfriend.,1
LANE,Really?,1
RORY,No.,1
LANE,What is he then?,1
RORY,He's my...gentleman caller.,1
LANE,"OK, Blanche.",1
RORY,I don't know what he is. But he's not my boyfriend. Do you think he's my boyfriend.,1
LANE,I think you guys spend a lot of time not kissing other people if this isn't a girlfriend/boyfriend thing.,1
RORY,Girlfriend.,1
LANE,You.,1
RORY,Boyfriend.,1
LANE,Him.,1
RORY,No. It sounds weird.,1
LANE,"Look, have you had the talk yet?",1
RORY,"Yes, Lane, babies come from the stork.",1
LANE,The other talk.,1
RORY,What other other talk?,1
LANE,"""We've been dating a few weeks no. Where do we stand? What are we to each other? If another girls asks you out, do you feel free to go?""",1
RORY,How is it that you know so much about this?,1
LANE,"Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach.",1
LANE,There he is.,1
RORY,I should do this later.,1
LANE,"No. No, you have to do this now.",1
RORY,Why?,1
LANE,Because I have to go home soon and my mom threw out our TV when she caught me watching V.I.P. So I'm bored and I need some en tertainment.,1
RORY,OK. Here I go.,1
LANE,"Good luck! Oh, and Rory, remembe r to enunciate. I'm reading lips out here.",1
RORY,Hey.,1
DEAN,"Oh, hey.",1
RORY,You're busy.,1
DEAN,Yeah. I just have to put the new green bean shipment on the shelves. You want to help?,1
RORY,"Yeah, sure. I, uh, I love stocking beans.",1
DEAN,"OK. Uh, follow me.",1
RORY,So do you work on Saturdays? I forget.,1
DEAN,Well it depends. Sometimes I come in if I don't have any plans. Why?,1
RORY,"No reason. See, there's this thing at my school on Saturday. Well it's not really at my school, it's kind of given by my school .",1
DEAN,What is it?,1
RORY,Well it's this thing where you go and they play music and you're supposed to get all dressed up and do some kind of dance and then there's chicken.,1
DEAN,Chicken?,1
RORY,"Well I don't know if there's chicken. But at these kinds of things they often serve chicken because it's probably cheaper and people eat it, so the logic behind the chicken choice really isn't that bad.",1
DEAN,I'm lost,1
RORY,It's a dance.,1
DEAN,Ah.,1
RORY,"And it's not like I'm dying to go or anything, but it is a new school and being a part of the social activities is really important at Chilton.",1
DEAN,So are you asking me to go to the dance with you?,1
RORY,"No. Yes. I mean, if you wanted to go, I would go too.",1
DEAN,Well that would probably be good since it's your school.,1
RORY,Right. So do you want to go?,1
DEAN,Honestly?,1
RORY,Yeah.,1
DEAN,I've actually never gone to a dance before.,1
RORY,Because they're lame?,1
DEAN,"Yeah. And it's just not the way I ever wanted to spend my time. I mean, I'm not a big joiner.",1
RORY,"OK, fair enough. More beans please.",1
DEAN,"You want to go, don't you?",1
RORY,"No. I don't. I have no desire to go at all. I was just thinking out loud, that's all.",1
DEAN,"So, uh, what would I have to wear?",1
RORY,What?,1
DEAN,To this dance. What would I have to wear?,1
RORY,Anything you want.,1
DEAN,Come on.,1
RORY,"No, really whatever you're comfortable in is fine.",1
DEAN,Rory...,1
RORY,Some sort of pants would be nice.,1
DEAN,Rory...,1
RORY,It's coat and tie.,1
DEAN,Oh man.,1
RORY,But you could probably get away with a coat and no tie.,1
DEAN,OK,1
RORY,Really?,1
DEAN,Yeah.,1
RORY,Thank you.,1
DEAN,You're welcome.,1
LORELAI,Aaaah!,1
LORELAI,Ow.,1
SOOKIE,Extra thread.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, God bless. I've been working so hard to finish Rory's dress I haven't been to get out.",1
SOOKIE,"Jeez, you are walking funny.",1
LORELAI,I know. Rory's dress made a pass at me and I think I pulled something getting up.,1
SOOKIE,"Here, sit, sit sit. Hey, you know what, I've got an Ace bandage in my bag. I'm not sure how we can wrap it but maybe we can do something kind of creative and --",1
LORELAI,Sookie. Ow,1
SOOKIE,Let's see.,1
LORELAI,Wow!,1
SOOKIE,"OK, I've got Percodan, Vicodin, Darvocet, and, uh...Take this one. It's a muscle relaxer. Very mild, I promise.",1
LORELAI,Thanks. Maybe later.,1
SOOKIE,OK. I've got to go. You sure you're going to be OK?,1
LORELAI,I'm sure.,1
SOOKIE,OK.,1
LORELAI,Bye.,1
SOOKIE,Bye.,1
LORELAI,Yeah.,1
EMILY,You sound terrible.,1
LORELAI,"I'm fine, Mom, I just stubbed my toe.",1
EMILY,Maybe you should get rid of some of that clutter in your living room.,1
LORELAI,Maybe,1
EMILY,That room is a hazard.,1
LORELAI,"Ah, you know, I've seen the light. Everything goes. What else have you got?",1
EMILY,I want to talk about Rory's dance. It's just k*lling me that she's not going.,1
LORELAI,Uh-huh.,1
EMILY,"It may seem frivolous and silly to her now but belive me, these are the kind of experiences you regret missing later.",1
LORELAI,OK.,1
EMILY,And regret can make you bitter. Do you want Rory to be bitter?,1
LORELAI,"Well, sort of.",1
EMILY,Lorelai.,1
LORELAI,"What, Mom? She can make some cash off of it. Become a crazy Oscar Levant kind of celebrity, go on talk shows, heckle Regis.",1
EMILY,I wish you would take this seriously.,1
LORELAI,"Mom, Rory is going to the dance.",1
EMILY,She is?,1
LORELAI,Uh-huh.,1
EMILY,"Oh, that's wonderful. I'm thrilled.",1
LORELAI,I'm mak ing her dress right now.,1
EMILY,You're making her dress?,1
LORELAI,Yep.,1
EMILY,But why?,1
LORELAI,"Well, so she'll look really ugly and people will point and throw rocks.",1
EMILY,Why don't you let me buy her a dress?,1
LORELAI,"Mom, you were thrilled five seconds ago, remember?",1
EMILY,You're not using the curtains are you?,1
LORELAI,"Mom, I gotta go.",1
EMILY,"Just one more thing. Take a picture of Rory for me, will you please?",1
LORELAI,I will.,1
EMILY,"On the stairs. And one by the front door. And one as she's getting ready, you know, putting her hair up, putting her makeup on?",1
LORELAI,"OK, do you want one when she's shaving her legs? You know, one leg up in the tub, wavingthe disposable razor in the air?",1
EMILY,This is a once in a lifetime ev ent. You get to be there and I don't.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, boy.",1
EMILY,I figure if I got enough pictures I could at least line them up in chronological order and pretend I was there.,1
LORELAI,Mom.,1
EMILY,"Maybe bind them together, make a flipbook out of them.",1
LORELAI,"Mom, would you like to come over on Saturday and see Rory go to the dance?",1
EMILY,"Why, what a nice idea, I'd love that, thank you. I'll see you at 7.",1
PARIS,"Hi, Tristin.",1
TRISTIN,Paris.,1
PARIS,"Two, I assume.",1
TRISTIN,You assume right.,1
PARIS,"So, who are you taking?",1
TRISTIN,"Why, are you free?",1
PARIS,"I'm, uh...",1
TRISTIN,"Nah, what am I thinking? You wouldn't be free this close to the dance.",1
PARIS,Here's your change.,1
TRISTIN,"Hey, is your hair shorter?",1
PARIS,"Yeah, a quarter of an inch.",1
TRISTIN,Really.,1
PARIS,I got it trimmed .,1
TRISTIN,Looks good.,1
PARIS,Thanks.,1
TRISTIN,And she's reading again. How novel.,1
RORY,"Good-bye, Tristin.",1
TRISTIN,Did you get the novel thing? Because...,1
RORY,I said good-bye.,1
TRISTIN,What are you doing here?,1
RORY,I like lines.,1
TRISTIN,The guy's supposed to buy the tickets.,1
RORY,Really. Does Susan Faludi know about this?,1
TRISTIN,Unless of course there is no guy.,1
RORY,There's a guy.,1
TRISTIN,A cheap guy.,1
RORY,"Well, what can I say? I like 'em cheap. Sloppy too -- bald spot, beer gut, you know, and the pants that kind of slip down in the back, giving you that good plumber shot. That sends me through the roof.",1
TRISTIN,So who is he?,1
RORY,How many languages can you say 'none of your business' in.,1
TRISTIN,Does he go to this school?,1
RORY,"No, he doesn't.",1
TRISTIN,"Uh-huh. Well, look, OK, I'll confess something to you. I don't have a date.",1
RORY,Well I hear Squeaky Fromme is up for parole soon. You should keep a good thought.,1
TRISTIN,Well I actually thought you'd like to go with me.,1
RORY,You did not.,1
TRISTIN,I did too.,1
RORY,You did not because you are not stupid.,1
TRISTIN,Why thank you.,1
RORY,"Slimy and weasely, yes, but stupid, no. You'd have to be stupid to think that, given our history, I would ever, barring a piano or a safe falling on my head, want to go anywhere with you, ever.",1
TRISTIN,"OK, fine. I'll take Cissy.",1
RORY,I'll send her a condolence card.,1
TRISTIN,Yeah. Well at least she won't be buying her own ticket.,1
RORY,"Two, please.",1
PARIS,Idiot.,1
RORY,Excuse me?,1
PARIS,He was totally nice to you and you couldn't be a bigger jerk.,1
RORY,"You like Tristin so much, you go out with him.",1
PARIS,I don't have enough change.,1
RORY,Pay me later.,1
PARIS,"What am I, your Versateller? Wait for change. I need change! Now! There's no way you're going with someone better than Tristin.",1
RORY,Whatever.,1
PARIS,You probably don't even have a date. You're probably going to come down with some very rare form of flu that only hits losers on dance night.,1
RORY,You know what? I don't want my change. Money makes people shallow.,1
PARIS,"I've got your change. Hey! Hey! If you think I'm keepig this dollar, I'm not!",1
BOY,I'll take it.,1
PARIS,Shut up!,1
LORELAI,Come on already!,1
RORY,I'm primping.,1
LORELAI,You're 16. You have skin like a baby's ass. There's nothing to primp.,1
RORY,"OK, OK, here I come.",1
LORELAI,Wow. Someone hit you with a pretty stick.,1
RORY,This dress is amazing. You outdid yourself.,1
LORELAI,"It's beautiful, babe, you look beautiful. Come here.",1
RORY,What?,1
LORELAI,Stray hair.,1
RORY,"Fix, please.",1
LORELAI,Yes. Hm. I think my favorite part is the shoes.,1
RORY,The heels hurt.,1
LORELAI,"Well, beauty is pain",1
RORY,I'll just throw them on on my way out,1
LORELAI,"No, you should put them on now and let your feet get really numb.",1
RORY,That's sick.,1
LORELAI,Go get me the hair spray.,1
RORY,OK.,1
LORELAI,It's open!,1
SOOKIE,It's me! I got tacos!,1
LORELAI,Yay!,1
SOOKIE,I got extra hot sauce and a couple of extra burritos to put in the fridge in case you get hungry later.,1
LORELAI,You take such good care of me.,1
RORY,"Hey, Sookie. Look.",1
SOOKIE,"Oh my God! You're a movie star! I'm serious. Oh my -- At some point tonight, walk down a flight of stairs. Movie stars always walk down staircases.",1
LORELAI,"OK, come on, let me spray while you try to figure out what she just said.",1
SOOKIE,"You, don't move. I got it.",1
SOOKIE,Ow!,1
LORELAI,Sookie.,1
SOOKIE,Wrong way! I got it.,1
RORY,Are you OK?,1
SOOKIE,"Yeah, sweetie, hand that to your mother, and my eyelashes are all stuck together.(Sookie stag",1
LORELAI,"Honey, are you sure you're alright?",1
SOOKIE,I'm fine.,1
LORELAI,"Shield the tacos. OK, ready?",1
RORY,God!,1
LORELAI,"OK, that will be good for six slow dances, four medium ones, one lambada, but if you plan on doing any moshing I suggest another coat.",1
RORY,I think I'm good.,1
SOOKIE,"Rory, sweetie, is this soap by the sink in the silver bottle?",1
RORY,No!,1
LORELAI,"Go in there, quick.",1
LORELAI,We're in here!,1
EMILY,We're in here? That's how you answer the door?,1
LORELAI,Well I was all out of Saran Wrap.,1
EMILY,I don't even want to figure that one out. I just want to see my granddaughter. Where is she?,1
LORELAI,Kitchen.,1
EMILY,"Oh, perfect. I want to be all ready for the big entrance. How's the light in here? Never mind. I'll just take one with the flash and one without to make sure we got it right.",1
LORELAI,"Wow, Mom, look at you. You'd think Anne Taylor was having a sale or something.",1
EMILY,"OK, Rory, come in here please.",1
RORY,"Hey, Grandma",1
EMILY,She has lived with you too long.,1
LORELAI,"Honey, lose the bib and the taco, put your shoes on, come back out, and let Grandma take the pretty picture.",1
RORY,OK.,1
SOOKIE,I'm gonna get going.,1
LOREAI,You are not driving.,1
SOOKIE,"I walked. It was nice to see you again, Mrs. Gilmore, or at least make out your shape.",1
LORELAI,Call in fifteen minutes or I'm sending out a search party.,1
SOOKIE,And you call me if I can come over and help you up the stairs or something.,1
LORELAI,"No, I'll be fine.",1
SOOKIE,Bye.,1
EMILY,Why would you need help up the stairs?,1
LORELAI,"No reason. Rory, let's go, your public awaits!",1
EMILY,Why aren't you moving?,1
LORELAI,"I'm comfortable, that's all.",1
EMILY,Are you hurt?,1
LORELAI,"I have a little back spasm, that's it. It's no big deal.",1
EMILY,What sort of back spasm?,1
LORELAI,"I don't know, Mom, just a normal one.",1
EMILY,There is nothing normal about a back spasm. The very fact that it has the word spasm in it means it's not normal.,1
LORELAI,"Alright, here she is, Mom, get your camera moving.",1
EMILY,"What? Oh, my, you're gorgeous. Oh! Smile!",1
EMILY,I'm so glad you decided to buy her a dress.,1
RORY,That's Dean!,1
LORELAI,"Hey, come here. Have an amazing time.",1
RORY,"I'll chronicle the whole evening for you, I promise. Bye, Grandma.",1
EMILY,Where are you going?,1
RORY,To the dance.,1
EMILY,You do not go running out the door when a boy honks.,1
LORELAI,"Mom, it's fine.",1
EMILY,It certainly is not fine. This is not a drive through. She's not fried chicken.,1
RORY,But I told him to honk and I'd meet him out there. We agreed.,1
EMILY,"I don't care what you told him. If he wants to take you out, he will walk up to this door, and know, and say 'good evening,' and come inside for a moment like any civilized human being would know to do.",1
LORELAI,"Now, Mom, this is silly, I have met him already.",1
EMILY,Well I haven't.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, but--",1
EMILY,We will wait until he comes to the door.,1
RORY,He doesn't know he's supposed to.,1
EMILY,He will figure it out.,1
EMILY,"He's not a very bright boy, is he?",1
LORELAI,"Mom, please.",1
EMILY,Don't rush. A lady never rushes.,1
RORY,Hey.,1
DEAN,"Hey, uh, I thought I was supposed to honk.",1
RORY,"I know, I'm sorry.",1
EMILY,"Young man, come in here please.",1
LORELAI,"Hey, Dean, meet my mother, Emily Post.",1
EMILY,Emily Gilmore,1
DEAN,Hi.,1
EMILY,Hello.,1
LORELAI,"Great rap session. Alright, you guys are out of here. Have fun.",1
EMILY,Be home by eleven,1
RORY,"Bye Mom, by Grandma.",1
EMILY,What do you know about this boy?,1
LORELAI,I know that Rory likes him and that his parole officer has high hopes for his rehabilitation.,1
EMILY,Does he drink?,1
LORELAI,Like a fish.,1
EMILY,That's not a crazy question.,1
LORELAI,"It is a crazy question, Mom, because if I had knowledge of him being a drinker, he would not be with Rory now.",1
EMILY,"Yes, but--",1
LORELAI,"Mom, please relax. Dean is a good kid. Rory's gonna have a great time. You got your pictures and tomorrow I will call you and give you all the details.",1
EMILY,What are you going to do?,1
LORELAI,What do you mean?,1
EMILY,Well you certainly can't be left alone.,1
LORELAI,Yes I can.,1
EMILY,You can barely move. You've been sitting on that couch since I got here.,1
LORELAI,That's because this is a right comfy couch.,1
EMILY,Maybe I should stay.,1
LORELAI,"No, no, Mom, you really don't have to do that.",1
EMILY,I'm not leaving my daughter stranded on the couch. What if you need to get to the bathroom?,1
LORELAI,"I don't go anymore, Mom. I gave it up cold turkey.",1
EMILY,I'm staying.,1
LORELAI,"No, Mom...Look -- I can stand, OK?",1
LORELAI,"See? I'm up. OK, see? I'm fine.",1
EMILY,Move.,1
LORELAI,What?,1
EMILY,"Move. If you're fine, than move.",1
LORELAI,I can move. This is me mo ving. Any second now the moving will begin. Rats.,1
EMILY,I'll go start some tea. Please tell me you have something besides Lipton.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, a stroke would be so good right about now.",1
RORY,Maybe we should just forget about this,1
DEAN,OK.,1
RORY,"I mean, it's just a dance. What's the big deal?",1
DEAN,Beats me.,1
RORY,And these kids at my school -- awful. Have you seen The Outsiders?,1
DEAN,"Yeah, I have.",1
RORY,Just call me Ponyboy. I heard this place is beautiful though -- old and historic.,1
DEAN,Huh.,1
RORY,Maybe we could just go in for a minute.,1
DEAN,Fine.,1
RORY,Or not.,1
DEAN,Fine too.,1
RORY,I don't know. Why can't I decide? This is stupid. What do you think?,1
DEAN,I think that you look amazing.,1
RORY,Maybe just a couple minutes won't hurt.,1
EMILY,"Yes, Marta. Just make sure everything's locked up before you leave. No, I won't be home tonight.",1
EMILY,Was that a pain?,1
LORELAI,Yes. A big one.,1
EMILY,Alright. That's it. Bye.,1
LORELAI,"So, Mom, you really, really don't have to do this.",1
EMILY,Don't be silly. I couldn't possibly leave you alone like this.,1
LORELAI,"What are you doing, Mom?",1
EMILY,I'm trying to find the candlesticks I bought you.,1
LORELAI,What candlesticks?,1
EMILY,The Baccarat candlesticks I bought you last year for Christmas. I assumed you stuffed them in the back of the closet somewhere.,1
LORELAI,"Uh, well, no, I did not stuff them in the back of the closet.",1
EMILY,Well then where are they? I don't see them out.,1
LORELAI,"Well, see, we didn't actually have a...big use for the crystal candlesticks so I kind of...exchanged them.",1
EMILY,For what?,1
LORELAI,A monkey lamp.,1
EMILY,Pardon me?,1
LORELAI,It's a lamp with a bunch of monkeys on it.,1
EMILY,Baccarat candlesticks for a moneky lamp?,1
LORELAI,"They're really, really happy monkeys, Mom.",1
EMILY,Where is this lamp? I want to see it.,1
LORELAI,It's right there on the desk.,1
EMILY,Oh my God! They're holding coconuts and leering!,1
LORELAI,It's funny.,1
EMILY,You traded my lovely gift for for a semi-pornographic leering monkey lamp? How could you?,1
EMILY,"This is not just about the bad breeding of returning a gift. This goes right to the heart of the question of taste. You were given something of substance and you cast it off for a ridiculous, slightly sinister barroom decoration. Explain this to me, Lorelai.",1
LORELAI,My back hurts.,1
RORY,Well it's a very good room.,1
DEAN,Looks historical.,1
RORY,I commen d the person that suggested this very location.,1
DEAN,"So, we could just get our picture taken and leave.",1
RORY,We could.,1
DEAN,Or we could dance a little first.,1
RORY,Yeah?,1
DEAN,I stress a little.,1
RORY,Something slow.,1
DEAN,That sounds good.,1
LOUISE,Can we go yet?,1
MADELINE,We haven't even eaten dinner.,1
LOUISE,I'm bored.,1
MADELINE,We have to wait for Paris anyway.,1
LOUISE,Fine. Give me your roll.,1
MADELINE,Wow.,1
LOUISE,What?,1
MADELINE,"Rory Gilmore. God, she's got good hair.",1
LOUISE,Who's the dish?,1
MADELINE,Beats me.,1
LOUISE,"He's not of the manor born, that's for sure. Let's go.",1
RORY,"So, should we dance or should we sit first?",1
LOUISE,"Rory...you came. Oh, great dress. Who's it by?",1
RORY,Lorelai Gilmore.,1
MADELINE,You made it yourself?,1
RORY,"No, my mom mad e it for me.",1
MADELINE,She did? Really?,1
RORY,Yeah.,1
LOUISE,So you traveling with a bodyguard now?,1
RORY,"Oh, no. This is my -- this is Dean. Dean, this is Louise and Madeline.",1
DEAN,Hey.,1
MADELINE,My mom can't make anything.,1
LOUISE,How tall are you?,1
DEAN,Uh...,1
MADELINE,Soup! She can make soup!,1
LOUISE,"You know, my whole family is really tall. The men, mostly. What are you -- 6'1"", 6'2""?",1
RORY,"What, does he get like a prize if he guesses?",1
MADELINE,"One kind of soup, actually. It's green, lumpy.",1
DEAN,"I'm 6'2"".",1
MADELINE,"Actually, she can't make soup either.",1
LOUISE,Six-two's a good height.,1
DEAN,You think?,1
LOUISE,I think.,1
DEAN,Huh.,1
DEAN,What do you think? Too tall?,1
RORY,Not in heels.,1
DEAN,Good.,1
RORY,Although the saddle shoes make it kind of difficult.,1
DEAN,Well I'll just have to stoop then.,1
RORY,I guess so.,1
LOUISE,OK. I'm bored.,1
MADELINE,I like your dress.,1
RORY,Thanks.,1
RORY,"Hey, you're nice.",1
DEAN,Slow song.,1
RORY,Let's go.,1
PARIS,Rory.,1
RORY,Paris.,1
PARIS,I see you came.,1
RORY,You sold me the ticket.,1
JACOB,I'm Jacob.,1
RORY,"Hi, I'm Rory. This is Dean.",1
DEAN,Hi.,1
JACOB,Hi.,1
PARIS,Excuse us.,1
PARIS,Those are not friends.,1
JACOB,I was being polite.,1
PARIS,Well don't,1
DEAN,"So, that's Paris?",1
RORY,"Yes, it is.",1
DEAN,She seems fun.,1
RORY,"Oh, yeah, she is.",1
DEAN,"OK, so, this dancing thing is not something I want you to get used to or comment on.",1
RORY,"Now, that goes both ways.",1
DEAN,"Hey, if I kiss you is a nun gonna come out here and boot me out of here",1
RORY,It's not a Catholic school.,1
DEAN,So I can kiss you?,1
RORY,"Yeah, you can kiss me.",1
CISSY,"OK, I'm perfect now.",1
TRISTIN,Great.,1
CISSY,You wanna dance?,1
TRISTIN,Nope.,1
CISSY,You wanna eat?,1
TRISTIN,Nope.,1
CISSY,You wanna go make out?,1
TRISTIN,"Yeah, alright, let's go.",1
DEAN,"So, Ponyboy, you happy?",1
RORY,"Yeah, I'm happy.",1
EMILY,There you go.,1
LORELAI,"Mom, I think somebody already ate that.",1
EMILY,That is a mashed banana on toast.,1
LORELAI,OK.,1
EMILY,I used to make this for you all the time when you were a little girl.,1
LORELAI,You did?,1
EMILY,"Yes, whenever you got sick I made this.",1
LORELAI,Are you sure it wasn't the other way around?,1
EMILY,You don't want it.,1
LORELAI,"No, no, I want it.",1
EMILY,I'll just take it back to the kitchen,1
LORELAI,"No, Mom, I said I want it.",1
EMILY,Are you sure? Because I can throw it away.,1
LORELAI,"Relinquish the banana, please. Mmm.",1
EMILY,You can't possibly be comfortable like that.,1
LORELAI,"Mother, please, this is the first position in 24 hours that that has not made me crazy.",1
EMILY,Alright. You're not eating.,1
LORELAI,Mom.,1
EMILY,Yes?,1
LORELAI,Please don't make me eat this.,1
EMILY,You have to eat something.,1
LORELAI,"Well, Sookie left me a b urrito in the fridge.",1
EMILY,I'll go warm it up for you.,1
LORELAI,I can eat it cold.,1
EMILY,Oh. Fine. I'll just go get it then.,1
LORELAI,Hot's better though.,1
EMILY,I'll be right back.,1
DEAN,"OK, uh, I need something to drink. Do you want some punch?",1
RORY,Sure.,1
JACOB,"Hi, Rory, right?",1
RORY,Yes.,1
JACOB,We met earlier with Paris...,1
RORY,"Yes, I rememb er.",1
JACOB,Are you having a good time?,1
RORY,Actually I am. You?,1
JACOB,"It's OK. So, was that your boyfriend?",1
RORY,Oh. I don't know. I'm not sure.,1
JACOB,You're not sure?,1
RORY,"We've only been going out a little while, so...",1
JACOB,"So, there's still a little room to play?",1
RORY,What?,1
JACOB,Would you like to dance?,1
RORY,"Oh, no thanks.",1
JACOB,Maybe I could get your number.,1
RORY,What for?,1
JACOB,To call you.,1
RORY,"I'm sorry, aren't you here with Paris?",1
JACOB,Yeah.,1
RORY,So maybe you shouldn't be over here asking me for my number then.,1
JACOB,Why? Paris is my cousin.,1
RORY,Your cousin?,1
JACOB,Yeah.,1
RORY,Paris is your cousin? You're related?,1
JACOB,Yeah.,1
RORY,"Jacob, it's been very nice to meet you. I hope you have a lovely evening.",1
EMILY,Oh look -- Barbara Stanwyck. I just love Barbara Stanwyck.,1
LORELAI,"Oh yeah, she's good.",1
EMILY,"She had that wonderful voice -- that husky, deep voice. I just love that voice.",1
LORELAI,"You know Mom, you have kind of a Barbara Stanwycky voice.",1
EMILY,Oh I do not.,1
LORELAI,I mean it. You could have gotten Fred McMurray to off Dad if you'd really wanted to.,1
EMILY,"Oh you do enjoy teasing me, don't you?",1
LORELAI,"You know, I really do.",1
EMILY,"You know, Rory looked so lovely tonight.",1
LORELAI,"She did, didn't she?",1
EMILY,I just can't get over how she's grown up into that little woman who walked out of here.,1
LORELAI,"I know. You know what, Mom?",1
EMILY,You did a lovely job.,1
LORELAI,Thank you.,1
EMILY,With Rory and the dress.,1
LORELAI,Thank you.,1
EMILY,"Well, let me get this out of your way. You really don't remember me making this for you when you were sick?",1
LORELAI,I don't. I'm sorry,1
EMILY,Well I did and you loved it.,1
LORELAI,You know what? Let me give it a try.,1
LORELAI,Hmm.,1
EMILY,Yes?,1
LORELAI,It's even more disgusting than I thought it was going to be.,1
EMILY,Oh it is not.,1
EMILY,"Oh my God, it's horrible! What on earth was I thinking?",1
DEAN,"So, uh, you want to maybe go?",1
RORY,"You're bored. I'm sorry. Yeah, let's go, right away.",1
DEAN,"I'm not bored. I thought, you know, there's still a little time left, maybe we could get a cup of coffee somewhere, hang out a little, talk a walk. You know, just us.",1
RORY,That'd be nice.,1
DEAN,"No, you stay. I'll get the coats.",1
PARIS,So. How many people have you told? Four? Five? Everybody?,1
RORY,What are you talking about?,1
PARIS,"You know that Jacob is my cousin and now you finally have all the amm*nit*on to pay me back, right?",1
RORY,I don't want to pay you back. I just want to get awy from you.,1
PARIS,"Now you can just go all over the school and just tell everybody that Paris Geller couldn't get a date to the dance. That she had no one and since she couldn't just not come, she had to get her mother to ask her cousin Jacob to take and then she had to give him gas money to make him do it. Go ahead! Tell them!",1
RORY,I don't have to. You just did.,1
TRISTIN,"You know, we haven't met.",1
DEAN,"No, we haven't.",1
TRISTIN,I'm Tristin.,1
DEAN,"Ah, yes we have.",1
TRISTIN,What are you talking about?,1
DEAN,Rory's mentioned you.,1
TRISTIN,Oh yeah?,1
DEAN,Yeah. I wouldn't get quite so excited about it.,1
TRISTIN,"Oh, why, did she say something mean?",1
DEAN,She said you're a jackass.,1
TRISTIN,Really?,1
DEAN,"Actually, no, Rory doesn't use words like that. I embellished a little.",1
TRISTIN,Oh so you're the big strong protector? Little princess needs a protector?,1
DEAN,"What's your problem, man?",1
TRISTIN,"Nothing. Just don't like your girlfriend, that's all.",1
DEAN,Really? Doesn't look that way to me.,1
TRISTIN,I don't really care how it looks to you.,1
DEAN,"Hey. You got in my path, not the other way around.",1
DEAN,You're kiding right?,1
TRISTIN,"Why, are you going somewhere?",1
DEAN,Get out of my way Dristan.,1
TRISTIN,"Oh, aren't you clever.",1
RORY,"Hey, what's going on?",1
TRISTIN,Nothing. Just getting to know your boyfriend here.,1
DEAN,"It's going really well, don't you think?",1
TRISTIN,Oh yeah. We're just about to build a clubhouse.,1
RORY,"OK. Well I hate to break up the party, but we should go.",1
TRISTIN,"Oh, why? Little girl's got to be home?",1
DEAN,Stop.,1
TRISTIN,"No, I think you two make a very cute couple. Is your horse and buggy parked outside? Got to get home for the barn raising?",1
DEAN,Let's go.,1
DEAN,What the hell do you think you're doing?,1
TRISTIN,"OK, you will not push me ag ain.",1
DEAN,Are you seriously trying to act tough? You're wearing a tie for God's sake.,1
TRISTIN,Outside! Now!,1
DEAN,I'm not fighting you. It'd be like fighting an accountant. I'll call you when I need my taxes done.,1
DEAN,You don't want to fight me Tristin!,1
TRISTIN,Why not?,1
DEAN,"'Cause I'll k*ll you, idiot! Come on, Rory, let's go.",1
DEAN,You will not come near her. Ever again.,1
MADELINE,Wow. That was good.,1
LOUISE,Whatever.,1
PARIS,Are you OK?,1
LOUISE,Did you really bring your cousin?,1
LORELAI,What are you doing?,1
EMILY,Go to sleep.,1
LORELAI,The movie's not over.,1
EMILY,I'll tell you how it ends.,1
LORELAI,"Thank you, Mommy.",1
DEAN,That was quite a dance.,1
RORY,I seriously don't know what got into him.,1
DEAN,I do.,1
RORY,What?,1
DEAN,He has a thing for you.,1
RORY,No he doesn't. It's just a game to him or something.,1
DEAN,He has a thing for you.,1
RORY,He does nothing but insult me an d make me miserable.,1
DEAN,He has a thing for you.,1
RORY,I don't know how I feel about this whole situation.,1
DEAN,What do you mean?,1
RORY,I don't know...having my boyfriend defend my honor. It's weird.,1
DEAN,"Uh, boyfriend?",1
RORY,What?,1
DEAN,You said 'boyfriend.',1
RORY,"No! I just meant boyfriend in the sense that the whole defending me thing was very boyfriendy, but only in the broadest sense of the word, which doesn't even apply at all here.",1
DEAN,You are seriously babbling.,1
RORY,I didn't mean that you're my boyfriend.,1
DEAN,OK.,1
RORY,I don't think you're my boyfriend.,1
DEAN,OK.,1
RORY,Dean?,1
DEAN,What?,1
RORY,Are you my boyfriend?,1
DEAN,In the broadest sense of the word way?,1
RORY,"No, in the real, 'hi this is Dean, my boyfriend' kind of way.",1
DEAN,Well I am if you want me to be.,1
RORY,I do.,1
DEAN,OK.,1
RORY,So it's settled.,1
DEAN,Yes it is.,1
RORY,You're my boyfriend.,1
DEAN,That's the consensus.,1
RORY,I'm feeling pretty good about this decision.,1
RORY,I guess Miss Patty forgot to lock up.,1
DEAN,I've never really seen in here before.,1
DEAN,Are all these women really Miss Patty?,1
RORY,Yep. She said she's done everything there is to do in show business except set fire to the hoop the dog jumps through.,1
DEAN,"I'll get it. God, this weighs a ton. What do you have in here?",1
RORY,"I don't know. A lipstick, five dollar bill. Gum, hair spray, a book.",1
DEAN,A book?,1
RORY,Yeah.,1
DEAN,You brought a book to the dance?,1
RORY,Yeah.,1
DEAN,You thought there'd be a lot of downtime?,1
RORY,No. I just take a book with me ev erywhere. It's just habit.,1
DEAN,"So, uh, what are you reading?",1
RORY,The Portable Dorothy Parker.,1
DEAN,"'There's little in taking or giving. There's little in water or wine. This living, this living, this living, Was never a project of mine.' Cheery.",1
RORY,Funny though. Hey --,1
DEAN,What?,1
RORY,Thank you for tonight. It was perfect.,1
DEAN,,1
PATTY,"OK, ladies. Grab your yoga mats.",1
WOMAN,I don't think I'll ever get warm again.,1

DEAN,"Calm down, I'll explain it to your mom.",1

DEAN,I got it. Relax.,1
RORY,I have to go.,1
DEAN,Rory! Wait up!,1
RORY,I have to go.,1
DEAN,I'm going with you. We'll explain. It'll be OK.,1
RORY,No you can't come w ith me. You shouldn't be anywhere near my house right now.,1
DEAN,It's not our fault.,1
RORY,I know. I just have to get home.,1
DEAN,"Look, please, please let me come with you.",1
RORY,No!,1
DEAN,Rory --,1

EMILY,Lorelai! Get up. Now. Right now!,1
LORELAI,What?,1
EMILY,Rory's not home!,1
LORELAI,Rory's what?,1
EMILY,I sat in that chair all night and I dozed off for one second and the next thing I know it's 5:30 and she's not here.,1
LORELAI,Rory?,1
EMILY,She's not there. Aren't you listening?,1
LORELAI,Rory? Rory?,1
EMILY,Where's the phone? Call the police.,1
EMILY,What are you doing? Call the police! Call the police!,1
LORELAI,"Mom, stop it!",1
EMILY,What are you doing?,1
LORELAI,I'm looking for the phone. What do you think I'm doing?,1
EMILY,Why don't you ever clean up around here? This is an emergency and you can't even find the phone. What if there was a fire? What if Rory was choking?,1
LORELAI,"Mom, stop yelling!",1
EMILY,Rory is missing!,1
LORELAI,I know that and your yelling is not helping me!,1
LORELAI,"Rory? Oh, Patty. What? OK. Thanks. No, than you so much. OK Bye-bye. Rory's OK.",1
EMILY,Where is she? What happened?,1
LORELAI,She and Dean were at Miss Patty's.,1
EMILY,"What is that, a motel?",1
LORELAI,"Um, it's a dance studio. That was Patty. She said that she found them asleep and woke them up and Rory's on her way home.",1
EMILY,In what state were they found in?,1
LORELAI,"She didn't say, OK. Let's just try to be calm until we know what happened.",1
EMILY,What do you mean 'until we know what happened'? We know what happened.,1
LORELAI,No we don't.,1
EMILY,They were out all night!,1
LORELAI,I'm gonna make some coffee.,1
EMILY,"Lorelai Gilmore, I've watched you do a lot of stupid things in your life and I have held my tongue.",1
LORELAI,You've what?,1
EMILY,But I will not stand by and let you allow that girl to ruin her life.,1
LORELAI,Mom -- back off.,1
EMILY,"She spent the night out with that boy, the one you let her run off to that dance with.",1
LORELAI,"Mom, so help me G od, I will not get into this with you.",1
EMILY,She's doing the same thing you did.,1
LORELAI,No she's not.,1
EMILY,She's going to get pregnant.,1
LORELAI,No she's not.,1
EMILY,She's gonna ruin everything just like you did.,1
LORELAI,"No she's not! No she's not! No she's not! Rory is a good kid, Mom! She's not me.",1
EMILY,What kind of mother are you to allow this to happen to her?,1
LORELAI,"Oh, I don't know, Mom. What kind of mother were you?",1
EMILY,You're going to lose her. You're going to lose her just like I lost you.,1
LORELAI,"I am not going to lose her. Do you hear me? Even if I hadn't gotten pregnant, you still would have lost me. I had nothing in that house. I had no life. I had no air. You strangled me. I do not strangle Rory.",1
EMILY,Oh you're so perfect and I was so horrible. I put you in good schools. I gave you the best of everything. I made sure you had the finest opportunities. And I am so tired of hearing about how you were suffocated and I was so controlling. Well if I was so controlling why couldn't I control you running around getting pregnant and throwing your life away.,1
LORELAI,Get out!,1
EMILY,What?,1
LORELAI,"You will not come in to my house and tell me I threw my life away. Look around, Mom. This is a life. It has a little color in it so it may look a little unfamiliar to you, but it's a life. And if Ihadn't gotten pregnant I wouldn't have Rory.",1
EMILY,You know that's not what I meant.,1
LORELAI,"Maybe I was some horrible uncontrollable child like you say, but Rory isn't. She's smart and careful and I trust her and she's gonna be fine and if you can't accept that or believe it, then I don't want you in this house!",1
RORY,"Mom, thank you for saying all those --",1
LORELAI,What were you thinking? Staying out all night! Are you insane?,1
RORY,I'm sorry. It was an accident.,1
LORELAI,You're talking to the queen of staying out all night. I invented the concept! This is no accident! You can't do this! Period.,1
RORY,Nothing happened!,1
LORELAI,Do you have any idea what it's like to wake up with my mother here and find out that you never came home?,1
RORY,So all this is about Grandma being here.,1
LORELAI,"No, it's about the feeling of complete terror when your kid isn't in her bed in the morning.",1
RORY,I'm sorry.,1
LOREAI,And then it's about a whole different kind of terror when you find out that she spent the night with some guy.,1
RORY,I didn't spend the night with him. We fell asleep.,1
LORELAI,You are going on the pill.,1
RORY,What?,1
LORELAI,You're not getting pregnant.,1
RORY,I'm not sleeping with Dean.,1
LORELAI,Dammit !,1
RORY,What happened to all that stuff you said to Grandma What happened to trusting me? Where did all that go?,1
LORELAI,I think it's back on Patty's yoga mats.,1

RORY,"We were? Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I forgot.",1
LANE,Let me guess. You and Lorelai haven't made up yet?,1
RORY,"Nope. Things are still Miracle Worker at my house. God, how did everything get so screwed up?",1
LANE,I think you staying out all night with Dean had something to do with it.,1
RORY,And my grandmother being there to witness it didn't help.,1
LANE,Never does.,1
RORY,"It sucks. Things were good. School was good, Dean was good. Now my mother and I are barely speaking. Mom and Grandma are barely speaking. Dean's new name is  Narcolepsy boy'.",1
LANE,How's he taking it?,1
RORY,I don't know. I haven't talked to him since it happened.,1
LANE,That was four days ago.,1
RORY,I know.,1
LANE,Has he called?,1
RORY,I told him not to.,1
LANE,And he listened?,1
RORY,No.,1
LANE,Good boy.,1
RORY,"Ok, I really need to talk about something else now.",1

RORY,"Yes I did. I got a mow-ing cow shaped timer for Sookie, some cardio-salsa tapes for Michel, a book for Dean -",1
LANE,You got Dean a book?,1
RORY,Yeah.  Metamorphosis'.,1
LANE, Metamorphosis.',1
RORY,It's Kafta.,1
LANE,Very romantic.,1
RORY,I think it is romantic.,1
LANE,I know I've always dreamed that some day a guy would get me a really confusing Czechoslovakian novel.,1
RORY,I think he'll appreciate it.,1
LANE,A book sends the wrong message.,1
RORY,What are you talking about?,1
LANE,"You have to look at what a gift says to the other person, not to you. Remember two years ago, I got my mom that perfume?",1
RORY,Yeah.,1
LANE,"Ok, to me that said,  Hey mom, you work hard, you deserve something fancy'. Now to my mother, it said  Hey mom, here's some smelly sex juice, the kind I use to lure boys with' and resulted in me being sent to Bible camp all summer.",1
RORY,Yeah but -,1
LANE,"Just imaging that you actually gave Dean something really romantic, and he gave you a football. Your hypothetical romantic present is saying that you really, really like him. And his present is saying  Hey man, let's just be friends'.",1
RORY,And you're saying that this book is -,1
LORELAI,"Is a Czechoslovakian football, yes.",1
RORY,So then what do I get him?,1
LANE,What you should do is find out what he's getting you and gauge your gift accordingly.,1

EMILY,"Cocktails are at 6, dinner's at 8.",1
LORELAI,I probably won't be there for cocktails.,1

EMILY,"Lorelai let's be honest here, I'm not too happy with you right now and I assume you're not too happy with me.",1
LORELAI,My polka dot dress matched my face and still I had to sit through 12 courses.,1
EMILY,I am tired of forcing you to do all those terrible things that infringe upon your life and I do not have the energy to pretend that the way you treated my the other day was in any way acceptable.,1
LORELAI,So you're uninviting me to Christmas dinner?,1
EMILY,Yes I am.,1
LORELAI,Fine.,1
EMILY,Fine.,1

LORELAI,Oh she meant it.,1
RORY,"Well maybe she thinks she meant it at the time, but I bet she won't mean it later when I show up there without you.",1
LORELAI,"And without a map to follow that reasoning I say,  Take a hot it's cold outside'.",1
RORY,You just wanna hold a grudge.,1
LORELAI,"Yes, it burns more calories.",1
RORY,That's not true.,1

LORELAI,What?,1
RORY,I think you're acting a little immat ure.,1
LORELAI,I'm not acting.,1
RORY,Well what about the apple tarts? You wait all year for those apple tarts.,1
LORELAI,I can live without the apple tarts.,1
RORY,You've made up songs after eating five of them with lyrics that contradict that last statement.,1
LORELAI,"Oh you know what? You have to go, you're late.",1

EMILY,I'm not mad at anyone. Now go back in and join the party.,1
RORY,But -,1
EMILY,,1
LORELAI,"Yes Joe, I know it's Friday night, but I ordered my pizza an hour ago...Oh no I did not hear about the delivery van...Well I am very, very sorry to hear that. Now was it a fairly new van? Great, ok, well Joe, as with most tragedies in life there come a time when you just need to pick up and move one. So what's the next phase of the delivery saga? Mm-hmm...Well how long until your brother's back with the razor scooter? Ok, uh-huh, alright, just call me when it gets there. Bye Joe.",1
LORELAI,"Well, hi there.",1
DEAN,Hi.,1

LORELAI,Mm-hmm Something else?,1
DEAN,I just wanted to say that things got all messed up.,1
LORELAI,Yes they did.,1
DEAN,And I'm sorry.,1
LORELAI,Uh-huh.,1
DEAN,But nothing happened.,1
LORELAI,"Ok, I have to go.",1
DEAN,We sat down and we were reading this book and then we fell asleep.,1
LORELAI,Pick a more interesting book next time.,1
DEAN,So am I like public enemy #1 with you?,1
LORELAI,"#1? I don't know, would you settle for top five? Because I'm still a little hot for that crazy bomber guy who's been living in a cave for a year.",1
DEAN,Please just tell me w here I stand.,1
LORELAI,I don't know where you stand ok? All I know is my 16 year old daughter didn't come home one night and you had something to do with that.,1
DEAN,I told you - nothing happened,1
LORELAI,"Happened, I heard.",1
DEAN,"Look you can hate me but you have to believe me, I would not let anything happen to her.",1
LORELAI,You happened to her.,1
DEAN,I won't hurt her.,1
LORELAI,"You know, I was 16 when I had Rory.",1
DEAN,I know.,1
LORELAI,That is the same ag e she is now.,1
DEAN,I know.,1
LORELAI,She wants to go to Harvard.,1
DEAN,She will go to Harvard and if she doesn't it won't be because of me.,1
LORELAI,I don't hate you.,1
DEAN,No?,1
LORELAI,No. Though I did imagine 20 different ways to remove your head from your body.,1
DEAN,Yeah? Well which one looked the best?,1
LORELAI,Hedge clippers.,1
DEAN,Huh.,1
LORELAI,Dull ones.,1
DEAN,"Well, I mean sure you wouldn't want it to go quick.",1
LORELAI,Exactly.,1
DEAN,"Ok, uh, I'm gonna go.",1
LORELAI,Dean.,1

LUKE,Rory coming?,1
LORELAI,No.,1
LUKE,She on a date?,1
LORELAI,No.,1
LUKE,Good so you've forbid her to see the bag boy.,1
LORELAI,I'd really rather not talk about it right now.,1
LUKE,Just tell me you forbid her to see the bag boy.,1
LORELAI,I did not forbid her to see the bag boy.,1
LUKE,Are you crazy?,1
LORELAI,"Well, he looks like he's moving up to produce, so he's suddenly become quite a catch.",1
LUKE,That kid is trouble.,1
LORELAI,Can I order please.,1
LUKE,"First time I looked at him, I thought he was trouble.",1
LORELAI,"Excuse me, I'm the one who told you I thought he was trouble and you told me you thought I was crazy.",1
LUKE,You are crazy and he is trouble.,1
LORELAI,He is not trouble! He's 6'2...he's beautiful and he's completely in love with my daughter.,1
LUKE,Trouble.,1
LORELAI,Big time.,1
LUKE,I'll get your burger.,1
LORELAI,Wait. Can I see a menu?,1
LUKE,You need to see a menu?,1
LORELAI,Yes.,1
LUKE,You come here everyday.,1
LORELAI,"I know, but I usually order the same thing, and tonight I'm in the mood for something a little different.",1
LUKE,Menu.,1
LORELAI,"Piece of paper, list of food offered.",1
LUKE,"Ok, here. It's not in Japanese.",1
LORELAI,Don't you have any kind of holiday special? Something festive?,1
LUKE,I just got some G rey Poupon. That's French.,1
LORELAI,"Tonight's my parents big Christmas celebration. There's good food, these amazing apple tarts, big tree. It's the only holiday I actually enjoy going over there for and this year, I'm uninvited.",1
LUKE,Why the hell would anyone celebrate Christmas two weeks early?,1
LORELAI,Did you even hear the part about me being uninvited?,1
LUKE,To your parents' fake Christmas party?,1
LORELAI,Yes.,1
LUKE,I did hear that.,1
LORELAI,Do you care?,1
LUKE,Obviously you do.,1
LORELAI,"Yes, I do and I don't know why.",1
LUKE,You liked going...,1
LORELAI,I did.,1
LUKE,Rory's there without you...,1
LORELAI,She is.,1
LUKE,You and Rory aren't getting along right now and you feel bad at being separated during a time you usually share together.,1
LORELAI,Wow.,1
LUKE,Did I mention you come here every damn day?,1
LORELAI,I'll have a burger.,1
LUKE,,1
GIGI,"Emily, you've out done yourself yet again.",1
ALAN,"Yes, I can't imagine the hours you spent slaving over a hot stove.",1
EMILY,"You're teasing me, Alan.",1
ALAN,It's delicious Emily.,1
EMILY,"A compliment for my chef is a compliment for me, thank you Alan.",1
RICHARD,I for one would like to know where Henry is at this hour. Probably gallivanting around London like a bull out to stud.,1
EMILY,Richard please.,1
RICHARD,Well how is he supposed to negotiate the contract tomorrow morning if he's been out at all hours with some cheap tramp.,1
ALAN,"Knowing Henry, she wasn't cheap.",1
EMILY,This is wildly inappropriate dinner conversation especially in front of a young lady.,1
RICHARD,Is it unbearably hot in here?,1
EMILY,Richard don't loosen your tie at the table.,1
HOLLAND,So what are your plans for the Christmas holidays Rory?,1
RORY,I'll probably just be hanging out with my mom.,1
GIGI,"Oh it's such a shame she couldn't come, she's always such a kick.",1
EMILY,Lorelai wasn't feeling well so I suggested she stay home.,1
RICHARD,"It is hot in here, I'm going to lower the thermostat .",1
HOLLAND,"Poor thing, what's wrong with her?",1
EMILY,She has a touch of the flu. Richard forget the thermostat!,1
GIGI,I thought you said she was working?,1
EMILY,Well she was supposed to work but then she caught the flu so one way or another she couldn't have made it.,1
GIGI,Tell her we missed her.,1
RORY,I will.,1
EMILY,,1
LORELAI,What did you do?,1
LUKE,You wanted something festive.,1
LORELAI,You made me a S anta burger.,1
LUKE,It's not big deal.,1
LORELAI,He has a hat and everything.,1
LUKE,"Yeah, I just cut a piece of wonder bread, you know, poured a little ketchup, piped on a little cream cheese.",1
LORELAI,No one has ever made me something quite this disgusting before. I thank you.,1
LUKE,You're welcome.,1
LORELAI,What?,1
LUKE,Outside!,1
LORELAI,Are you kidding? It's like the North Pole out there.,1
LUKE,"Hey, this sign isn't just a decoration.",1
LORELAI,"Honey, nothing in here is a decoration.",1
LUKE,It's disturbs the other customers.,1
LORELAI,"Oh really? Maybe we should take a vote. Who thinks we shouldn't use cell phones in here? Well screw democracy. Perfect, Now I have to check my voice mail.",1
ALLorelai, ...the new born king'.,1
LUKE,"Whoa, what's going on?",1
TAYLORory,Well we were caroling around town and we got a bit chilly and we thought maybe we could trade you a song for some hot chocolate.,1
LUKE,You want free hot chocolate?,1
TAYLORory,"No no, we'll sing for it, any tune you like.",1
LUKE,And then I give you free hot chocolate.,1
TAYLORory,Yes.,1
LUKE,"Tell you want, you can have your hot chocolate, and pay for it, then go next door and sing for the marshmallows.",1
LORELAI,Oh my God!,1
TAYLORory,These are your neighbors Luke!,1
LUKE,Shut up Taylor. What's going on?,1
LORELAI,My father's in the hospital.,1
LUKE,What?,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, he collapsed or something. I don't know. I need a cab. I need to call a cab. Where's the phone? I need - can anyone give me - I'm holding a phone.",1
LUKE,"Whoa, calm down.",1
LORELAI,"No I can't calm down. I need a cab. What's the numbers? God, it's something-cabs, cabs- something-something, 1-800-cabs? Can somebody tell me the damn number of the cab guy?!",1
LUKE,I'll drive you.,1
LORELAI,But there's food and there's people and there's a burger with a face.,1
LUKE,"Ok, everybody out! We're closed, let's go. Food's on me. Put on your coat and get your stuff. Taylor, have your hot chocolate then lock up. Come on, my truck's out back.",1
LORELAI,"Luke, I'm -",1
LUKE,,1
LORELAI,Look.,1
LUKE,Relax.,1
LORELAI,We're being passed by senior citizens.,1
LUKE,I'm going as fast as I can.,1
LORELAI,"Bye Grandma, bye.",1
LUKE,"There's ice on the road, those people aren't being safe.",1
LORELAI,Well maybe they're not being safe but at least they're getting somewhere.,1
LUKE,"You checked it five times already, I've listened to it twice, it's not changing.",1
LORELAI," Grandpa's in the hospital, please come.' No details, no info. Who taught her to leave a message like that?",1
LUKE,I'm sure she was in a hurry.,1
LORELAI,A person needs details. Why is he in the hospital? How bad is it? What are the circumstances involving him being in the hospital? These are simple questions.,1
LUKE,We'll be there very soon and you'll know everything.,1
LORELAI,What if he's dead?,1
LUKE,He's not dead.,1
LORELAI,How do you know?,1
LUKE,I know.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, you're psychic now? You're suddenly getting visions while you're driving 20 mph in the oldest truck known to man? I'm sorry, you're k*lling yourself to get me there and I'm yelling at you. I don't mean it.",1
LUKE,I know.,1
LORELAI,"I feel like this is one of those moments when I should be remembering all the great times I had with my dad, you know. The time he took me shopping for a Barbie or to the circus or fishing and my mind is a complete blank.",1
LUKE,Well I'm sure it happened.,1
LORELAI,"No it didn't. We never did any of that. He went to work, he came home, he read the paper, he went to bed, I snuck out the window. Simple. He was a very by the numbers guy. I was never very good with numbers.",1
LUKE,I'm sure he loves you.,1
LORELAI,You know my dad is not a bad guy.,1
LUKE,I'm sure he's not.,1
LORELAI,He lived his life the way he thought he was supposed to. He followed the rules taught to him by his non-fishing-non-Barbie-buying dad. He worked hard. He bought a nice house. He provided for my mom. All he asked in return was for his daughter to wear white dresses and go to cotillion and want the same life that he had. What a disappointment it must have been for him to get me.,1
LUKE,I can't imagine anyone seeing you as a disappointment.,1
LORELAI,I bet you'd buy a Barbie for your daughter.,1
LUKE,"Yeah, well, I'd probably give her the cash to buy it herself and meet her by the baseball cards.",1
LORELAI,Hmm. You'll make a great dad.,1
LUKE,You make a great mom.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah. It's just the uh, daughter part I don't have down yet.",1
LUKE,,1
EMILY,But why can't I see him.?,1
NURSE,They're running some test.,1
EMILY,Well I would like to meet this doctor who's testing him.,1
NURSE,You will.,1
EMILY,"Some strange man is working on my husband, I have a right to meet this person.",1
NURSE,You will.,1
EMILY,And I want to see the room you're going to put him in.,1
NURSE,You will.,1
EMILY,And stop saying  You will'. Put a proper sentence together for God's sake.,1
NURSE,"Ma'am, please wait here.",1
RORY,Did you find out anything?,1
EMILY,"Please! They run this place like the CIA Joshua, thank God! This place is infuriating.",1
JOSHUA,"It's alright, I'm here, I'm going to check on him right now. Have you filled out the forms yet?",1
EMILY,"I don't care about the forms, I want to see my husband.",1
JOSHUA,Is she being obstinate?,1
RORY,Very.,1
JOSHUA,Let me see what's going on and then we'll take it from there.,1
EMILY,And there he goes through the doors.,1
RORY,Maybe I should call mom again.,1
EMILY,"Never mind, I'm sure she's very busy.",1
RORY,"That's not true, I bet she'd -",1
EMILY,"Rory, go get your Grandfather a paper -",1
RORY,But -,1
EMILY,"The Wall Street Journal or Barron's. Whatever they have, he'll want something to read when he gets back to his room.",1
RORY,"Ok, can I get you something? Maybe a coffee?",1
EMILY,"No dear, I'm fine.",1
NURSE,"Ms. Gilmore, uh, I need you to -",1
EMILY,"It's not  Ms. Gilmore', it's Mrs. Gilmore! Mrs. Gilmore, I'm not a cosmo woman!",1
NURSE,"I know this is difficult for you, but if you don't fill out these forms -",1
EMILY,What? You'll do what? I'd like to hear in your most condescending tone what my punishment will be for not filling out these forms in a timely manner. Are there bamboo sh**t involved? Some sort of dark deep hole in the ground? Rats nibbling at my toes?,1
LUKE,"Ok, we're supposed to follow the blue line, around the corner and then we should be -",1
LORELAI,Where's the scarecrow when you need him?,1
LUKE,"Ok, we have to ask someone else.",1
LORELAI,No! No! We just have to pick one.,1
LUKE,"Ah, well can't just wander around here aimlessly.",1
LORELAI,"Luke, listen to me, somewhere in this hospital are my mother and my father. Now I know I don't get along with them but there has to be some sort of intuition, some sort of blood bond that will somehow lead me to them.",1
LUKE,That's crazy.,1
EMILY,My great uncle founded this hospital -,1
LORELAI,And that's Emily.,1
EMILY,"You insensitive paper peddler! His portrait is hanging in the lobby, go look. It's right above the sign that says  Founder'!",1
LORELAI,Mom!,1
EMILY,Lorelai.,1
LORELAI,What's going on? How is he?,1
EMILY,You came!,1
LORELAI,Well of course I came. How's dad?,1
EMILY,That's what I've been trying to find out but this woman keeps pestering me with idiotic questions like  What's the number of my insurance policy and how long have we had it.',1
NURSE,I need to get this information.,1
EMILY,You need to get sensitivity training!,1
LORELAI,"Well, what if I fill out this information and you can go find someone who can tell us how my dad is.",1
NURSE,I'm not supposed to -,1
LORELAI,"Or, I could go and you can stay here and continue to discuss this with my mother",1
NURSE,I'll go.,1
LORELAI,Thank you.,1
EMILY,You got rid of her.,1
LORELAI,"Yes, so tell me w hat happened.",1
EMILY,That's amazing.,1
LORELAI,"Mom, please.",1
EMILY,I don't know what happened. He was hot and he went to turn down the thermostat and then - were you on a date?,1
LORELAI,What?,1
EMILY,You have an escort?,1
LORELAI,"No, it's Luke, Mom.",1
LUKE,Which is her way of saying we weren't on a date.,1
LORELAI,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that.",1
EMILY,Well how am I supposed to know you weren't on a date. It's Friday night and you show up here with a man.,1
LORELAI,"With Luke, Mom.",1
EMILY,It's not insane to assume a d ate was involved.,1
LORELAI,"You're right, ok, it's entirely possible that I was out on a date.",1
LUKE,Just not with me.,1
LORELAI,"I was eating at Luke's when I got the message. He gave me a ride, end of story. Is Dr. Reynolds here?",1
EMILY,"Yes, Joshua got her a while ago. He was supposed to come back the minute he knew something but he hasn't been back yet.",1
LORELAI,Well let's go find him.,1
EMILY,You can't find him! You can't find anyone! Everyone just keeps disappearing behind those doors!,1
LORELAI,"Well come on, let's go",1
EMILY,I didn't know you could do that.,1
LUKE,I'll wait here.,1
RORY,Luke.,1
LUKE,I gave your mom a ride. We weren't on a date.,1
RORY,"Oh, ok.",1
LUKE,She and your grandmother just went back to see if they can find a doctor.,1
RORY,Did they find out anything else about Grandpa?,1
LUKE,"I don't think so, but give your mom a couple of minutes back there, I bet she finds something out.",1
RORY,Thanks for bringing her.,1
LUKE,"You're welcome. Hey, you ok?",1
RORY,I don't want him to die.,1
LUKE,Well you tell him that when you see him ok? People like to hear that.,1
RORY,Mom!,1
LORELAI,"Hey, you! Hi.",1
RORY,It was horrible! It happened so fast.,1
LORELAI,They're about to bring him out of the big test room any minute so just hang in there.,1
RORY,Where's Grandma?,1
LORELAI,Kicking some patient out of the room with the good view.,1
RORY,Really?,1
LORELAI,"I hope they get him unhooked fast, otherwise he's going without the life support machine.",1
RORY,So how long before they bring him back?,1
LORELAI,Very soon.,1
RORY,I'd like to do something?,1
LORELAI,Like rollerblade?,1
RORY,Like get some coffee or make phone calls or do something that isn't standing here waiting.,1
LORELAI,"Ok, go it. Well as partial as I am to the phone, I'm voting for the  get coffee' idea.",1
RORY,"Ok, good. Luke tea?",1
LUKE,"Ah, peppermint preferably.",1
RORY,I'll be right back.,1
LORELAI,"Hey, he's gonna be fine.",1
RORY,I was just getting to know him.,1
LORELAI,I know.,1
RORY,I don't want him to -,1
LORELAI,He's not. Go get your coffee. Oh man!,1
LUKE,You're very brave for her.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, well it's my turn. God this sucks.",1
LUKE,"Hey come on, you gotta think positive here - bright side, good thoughts. Rainbows, unicorns, clowns, little cute...furry - ok I'm out.",1
LORELAI,Thank God.,1
EMILY,"Alright, we've secured him the room but the pillows are completely unacceptable. I'm gonna see if I can find him some down ones and some slippers. I'll be right back.",1
LORELAI,We'll be right here Jeez are you ok?,1
LUKE,"Yeah, I'm just not big on hospitals you know the smell, people being wheeled by with tubes sticking out of them, you know, drainage, fluids, gaping holes -",1
LORELAI,"Ok, listen, why don't you go home.",1
LUKE,You want me to go?,1
LORELAI,You don't look so good.,1
LUKE,Thanks.,1
LORELAI,That's not what I meant. You know you always look good.,1
LUKE,Yeah?,1
LORELAI,I mean you always look healthy.,1
LUKE,Ok.,1
LORELAI,But you don't look so healthy now. Now you look...,1
LUKE,Unhealthy.,1
LORELAI,Yes.,1
LUKE,Ok.,1
LORELAI,"Oh what? So I said you look good. We're not in 5th grade.  You look good', big deal. Stop staring at me.",1
LUKE,"Ah, jeez.",1
LORELAI,See that's what you get for being cocky.,1
LORELAI,"Uh, how is he?",1
ORDERLY,He's a little groggy right now.,1
LORELAI,What's going on? How are the tests?,1
ORDERLY,"The doctor will have to tell you that, I'm just the transport guy.",1
LORELAI,When is the doctor coming out?,1
ORDERLY,I'm not sure but you can go in with your dad until he gets here.,1
LORELAI,Thanks.,1
LUKE,"Go ahead, I'm good.",1
LORELAI,"That's ok, uh, I'm gonna go find my mom and Rory and tell them he's back up.",1
LUKE,I can tell them when they get here.,1
LORELAI,"That's ok, uh, I think they'd like to know now Ah!",1
EMILY,"Lorelai, you almost ran me over.",1
LORELAI,"Well, good thing we're in a hospital.",1
EMILY,Where were you going?,1
LORELAI,"To find you, they just brought dad up.",1
EMILY,When?,1
LORELAI,Just now.,1
EMILY,Well how is he? Did you talk to him?,1
LORELAI,"No not yet, I was coming to find you.",1
EMILY,Well come on.,1
LORELAI,"You go ahead mom, I'm gonna go find Rory.",1
EMILY,Fine.,1
LORELAI,Ok.,1
LUKE,You know I could look for Rory.,1
LORELAI,"No that's ok, I'll do it.",1
LUKE,"I thought so. Hey look, it's Rory.",1
RORY,The coffee machine was jammed so I got us some chicken soup and some Pez.,1
LORELAI,I was just coming to look for you.,1
RORY,"Why, is everything ok?",1

LORELAI,Stop.,1
LUKE,How about Jimmy Hoffa? That'll keep you busy for a while.,1
LORELAI,I said stop.,1
LUKE,You can't avoid going into that room forever.,1
LORELAI,I'm not avoiding anything. I'm going to find coffee.,1
LUKE,The machine's jammed .,1
LORELAI,Well there are other machines.,1
LUKE,Admit you're afraid.,1
LORELAI,You have no idea what you're talking about.,1

LORELAI,"Rory, there are only two things that I totally trust in this entire world. The fact that I will never be able to understand what Charo is saying no matter how long she lives in this country - and you.",1
RORY,Hopefully not in that order.,1
LORELAI,You just have to understand the major panic factor that went on there.,1
RORY,"I do, I really do and I'm so sorry. Nothing like that will ever happen again. I swear.",1
LORELAI,Don't swear.,1
RORY,Why not?,1
LORELAI,Because you are your mother's daughter.,1
RORY,What does that mean.,1
LORELAI,"It means things can happen, even when you don't really mean for them to happen.",1
RORY,They will not happen.,1
LORELAI,Hmm. Ok,1
RORY,I hated going to that party tonight without you.,1
LORELAI,I hated you going to that party tonight without me. How were the apple tarts?,1
RORY,"Oh, Grandma didn't make them this year.",1
LORELAI,Really?,1
RORY,Yup.,1
LORELAI,That's weird.,1
RORY,I know.,1

RORY,Through my teeth.,1
LORELAI,Good girl.,1

LUKE,It's a nice tie.,1
EMILY,It's Brooks Brothers.,1
LUKE,Ah.,1
EMILY,"It was bothering him tonight. I told him not to loosen it. I wanted him to look nice for our guests, so he didn't. And then well...The paramedics took it off him on the way here. I just haven't been able to put it down yet I must sound crazy.",1
LUKE,I've kept my father's entire store just the way he left it.,1
EMILY,Really?,1
LUKE,"Well I turned it into a diner, but I kept all his stuff on the walls, his pictures in the office, even the  Hardware' sign.",1
EMILY,I'm sure he would've appreciated having his life's worked being honored like that.,1
LUKE,He would've called me a d amn fool.,1
EMILY,"Oh, well. I don't know what Lorelai's told you about her father, I can certainly imagine, but he's a very good man. He always did the right thing for his family.",1
LUKE,That's what she told me.,1
EMILY,So what exactly is going on between the two of you?,1
LUKE,"Nothing. Really. We're friends, that's it.",1
EMILY,"You're idiots, the both of you.",1
EMILY,"There you are, where have you been?",1
LORELAI,Coffee hunt. So what's going on?,1
LUKE,Your mother called me an idiot.,1

LORELAI,"Ok, well, I'm just gonna...",1
LUKE,I'll be here.,1
EMILY,"...I've heard for such a long time. Richard, how are you darling?",1
JOSHUA,"Well Richard, it looks like we're gonna be stuck with you for a while longer. It was just a touch of angina.",1
EMILY,But you have to watch your diet.,1
JOSHUA,"Yes, that's going to be very important. No more red meat, heavy desserts and you're going to have to exercise regularly.",1
EMILY,Golf doesn't count.,1
RORY,So can he go home?,1
JOSHUA,"We'd like to keep him over night though, just to be sure.",1
RORY,But he's fine.,1
JOSHUA,"As long as he does what he's told, yes.",1
LUKE,"I heard, everything's ok.",1
LORELAI,"Yeah, yeah. They're going to keep him over night but - but he's going to be fine.",1
LUKE,"Hey. Ok, see here's where the guy is supposed to give the girl his handkerchief but I don't have one...and plus I find the practice a little revolting so...",1
LORELAI,"No, I'm ok.",1
LUKE,You sure?,1

LUKE,Ok.,1
RORY,He's gonna be fine.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, yeah. I think it was those financial papers that really did the trick. So, um, Luke's gonna take you home ok, I'm gonna hang out here for a while.",1
RORY,I'll stay too.,1
LUKE,"No, go, call Dean. Talk mushy to each other and then spend an hour arguing over who's going to hang up first.",1
RORY,You are gross.,1
LORELAI,I'll call you later.,1
RORY,"Ok, well tell him good bye for me. And tell Grandpa I'll come back tomorrow.",1
LORELAI,"Ok, I will, bye.",1
RORY,Bye.,1
LUKE,"Ok, walk fast and look straight ahead.",1

EMILY,Where's Rory?,1
LORELAI,I sent her home w ith Luke.,1
EMILY,What about you?,1
LORELAI,I thought I'd stick around in case anybody needed anything.,1
EMILY,Really?,1
LORELAI,"I mean not you. You obviously don't need anything, but somebody somewhere in this hospital might at some point need something and I'm gonna be the person who gets it for them.",1
EMILY,Would you like to go down to the cafeteria for something to eat?,1
LORELAI,Yes. Maybe somebody in the cafeteria will need something.,1
EMILY,Oh dear.,1
LORELAI,,1
LORELAI,Hello.,1

LUKE,I had some things to do.,1
LORELAI,"Right, anyways, this is for you.",1
LUKE,What's it for?,1
LORELAI,"Just thank you, Christmas, whatever.",1
LUKE,,1
LORELAI,"Do we really have to do this again? I just thought, you know, God forbid something happens to that one, you might need a spare. Here Does that look wrong. There! Oh hey turn out the lights",1
LUKE,"For what? It's not the real procession, it's just the rehearsal.",1
LORELAI,"So, it's pretty.",1
LUKE,And why do they need to rehearse it? It's the same thing every year.,1
LORELAI,"Come on Luke, please. It's hard to imagine living somewhere else isn't it?",1
LUKE,Thanks for the hat.,1

LORELAI,"Her lineage includes cocker spaniel, golden retriever, bouvier des flandres -",1
RORY,Gesundheith,1
LORELAI,Thank you - and rottweiler.,1
RORY,"Buttercup is a special dog. She's extremely skiddish and tends to react badly towards blonde haired females, brunette males, children of either sex, other animals, red clothing, cabbage or anyone in a uniform.",1
Posted,01/23/01 18:58,1
LORELAI,"Hey, we just found the doggy version of you.",1
MAN,Can I help you?,1

LORELAI,"Shut up you! We'd be excellent pet owners, thank you.",1
RORY,You cannot be serious.,1
LORELAI,We could get him a pretty bowl...,1
RORY,It's a her.,1
LORELAI,...and a new name...,1
RORY,Mom.,1
LORELAI,..cause this 'Buttercup' thing really has got to go.,1
RORY,Do I need to remind you of Skippy?,1
LUKE,Skippy?,1

LORELAI,He doesn't care.,1
LUKE,What happened to Skippy?,1
LORELAI,Nothing happened to Skippy.,1
RORY,"Every time mo m would put her hand in his cage, he'd bit her.",1
LORELAI,And laugh.,1
LUKE,Hamster's can't laugh.,1
LORELAI,Oh this one laughed - trust me.,1
RORY,So finally she got fed up.,1
LUKE,Of being laughed at by a hamster?,1
LORELAI,Well yeah.,1
RORY,So she stopped cleaning it's cage. Instead everyday she would stuff some Kleenex in there.,1
LUKE,You didn't?,1
LORELAI,It was the quilted kind,1
RORY,"So this keeps going on and the cage is just a cage full of Kleenex that moves a little, and the smell? Really good.",1
LUKE,I can imagine.,1
LORELAI,Oh no you can't,1
RORY,"So then she takes the cage to the place where we bought him, waits for the sales guy to go behind the desk and dumps it on the counter then bolts.",1
LUKE,You abandoned your hamster.,1
LORELAI,"Look, I know it was bad, but this was a vicious hamster. This was like a Damien hamster with little beady eyes and a big forked tail and...a cape with a...hood...and bye bye Buttercup. Bye Luke.",1
RORY,You did the right thing.,1
LORELAI,Oh . I want a pet.,1
RORY,You have me.,1

LORELAI,Yes we were.,1
MAX,There were candles and flowers and plates and knifes and cloth napkins.,1
LORELAI,"I love the little sombrero napkin holders, very ole.",1
MAX,"And the whole time w e were at said dinner table, you ate two maybe three bites of this amazing dinner I made for you.",1
LORELAI,Pass the bread.,1
MAX,"And yet, as soon as that dinner's over and I start cleaning up, suddenly that's when you're starving.",1
LORELAI,"What can I say - watching someone work makes me hungry. If I hadn't stopped watching ""This Old House"" I'd be 500 lbs right now.",1
MAX,Hmm.,1
LORELAI,What are you doing?,1
MAX,Passing these to you?,1
LORELAI,In the dish please. Ha ha ha.,1

MAX,I'm sure it is.,1
LORELAI,Oh and look! It's right on top.,1
MAX,Isn't that a coincidence?,1
LORELAI,"Wow, there are some really big words in here. I just hope you have a dictionary with you when you read it.",1
MAX,Oh I will.,1
LORELAI,"You know I could just save you the time and uh, put an 'A' on it for you.",1
MAX,Well that really wouldn't be fair to the other students who's mothers aren't here tonight wouldit?,1
LORELAI,"Yes you're right. Although, life isn't fair and the sooner those kids learn that the better.",1
MAX,Well I'll take that advise into account.,1
LORELAI,". Wow these are beautiful!. Hm, I never read Proust, I always wanted to. Every now and then, I'm seized with an overwhelming urge to say something like ""As Marcel Proust would say.."" but of course I have no idea what Marcel Proust would say so I don't even go there. I could do, uh, ""As Micheal Crichton would say.."" but it's not exactly the same you know.",1
MAX,"Well, take it.",1
LORELAI,Oh no! It-it looks so valuable,1
MAX,It's a book. It's meant to be read.,1
LORELAI,You sure?,1
MAX,"Take it, read it.",1
LORELAI,"Ok, I will.",1
MAX,Not now!,1
LORELAI,What?,1

RORY,Did you have a nice time?,1
LORELAI,Not bad.,1
RORY,That's a very big smile for a not bad night.,1
LORELAI,Yeah well...Hey he loaned me a book.,1
RORY,What book?,1
LORELAI,'Swann's Way',1
RORY,Aren't we ambitious.,1
LORELAI,Yes we are.,1
RORY,You know what it means when a man loans you a book don't you?,1
LORELAI,That he's already read it?,1
RORY,Yep.,1
LORELAI,How was your night?,1
RORY,Homework.,1
LORELAI,How many times did Dean call.,1
RORY,Not that many.,1

RORY,Just checking.,1
MAX,"""There's a certain slant of light, winter afternoons that oppresses like the heft of cathedral tunes."" That, my friends is the first verse of a poem by Emily Dickenson. Now read some of those tonight, and as you do, consider the fact that Emily Dickenson writes convincingly about passion and about the world in spite of the fact that she lived as a virtual recluse. It'll help you appreciate her mind.",1
MADELINE,I could listen to him talk about passion all day. Do you think he's dating anyone?,1
LOUISE,Of course he is.,1
MADELINE,A teacher?,1
LOUISE,Please.,1
MADELINE,Why not?,1
LOUISE,Have you seen teachers?,1
MADELINE,He's a teacher.,1
LOUISE,Male teachers are different. They can still be mysterious.,1
MADELINE,I bet his girlfriend's pretty.,1
LOUISE,I bet she's dumb.,1
MADELINE,Why?,1
LOUISE,Dumb girls crave smart men. It's that whole Marilyn Monroe - Arthur Miller syndrome.,1
MADELINE,I still think she's lucky,1
PARIS,"Whoever he's dating is a loser, who doesn't care that he's a teacher in this ridiculous school making a ridiculous teacher's salary. What are you looking at?",1
LOUISE,Guess someone read the paper today.,1
MADELINE,I know. Paris' parent's divorce is getting very ugly!,1
LOUISE,Her dad should've just paid her mom everything she wanted and this whole thing would've been over.,1
MADELINE,That's what my dad did. Hi!,1
LOUISE,Hi.,1
RORY,Hey.,1
MADELINE,Is it true Paris' mom had the entire back of her body surgically reconstructed?,1
LOUISE,Well it doesn't match the front now does it?,1

GRANDMA,What are you talking about?,1
LORELAI,You're smiling.,1
GRANDMA,I'm happy.,1
LORELAI,"That's not your ""I'm happy"" smile.",1
GRANDMA,Well what smile is it Loerlai?,1
LORELAI,"That's your ""I've got something on Lorelai"" smile.",1
GRANDMA,Rory your mother must be very tired.,1
RORY,She works a lot.,1
LORELAI,I grew up with that smile - I know that smile.,1
GRANDMA,Tell me ab out school.,1
RORY,"Well, my French final went pretty well.",1
LORELAI,You can change the subject. I know the smile.,1
GRANDMA,Whatever you say dear.,1
LORELAI,I've used it a few times myself.,1
RORY,Mom.,1
GRANDMA,So tell me ab out parent's day?,1
LORELAI,What?,1
GRANDMA,Parent's day? Next Wednesday? When all the parents are supposed to go to the classes with their children all day long?,1

LORELAI,Right.,1
GRANDMA,You didn't read yours?,1
LORELAI,Not yet.,1
GRANDMA,Ah.,1
LORELAI,But you knew that -,1
GRANDMA,Well -,1
LORELAI,Hence the smile.,1
GRANDMA,"Lorelai, you're really being silly. There's no evil plan a foot here. I simply brought up a subject I thought we could all talk about.",1
LORELAI,Oh right.,1
GRANDMA,I'll try another subject - the colour blue is very pleasant isn't it?,1
LORELAI,Mom not everybody can wait outside the mailbox for the Chilton newsletter to arrive and then instantly memo rize the contents in three seconds.,1
RORY,I'd like to weigh in on the blue colour subject please.,1
GRANDMA,You have your priorities far be it from me to question them.,1
LORELAI,Just because I don't read the newsletter doesn't mean I don't care about my daughter.,1
GRANDMA,So are you going?,1
LORELAI,To what?,1
GRANDMA,To parent's day!,1
LORELAI,Why don't we talk about it next Friday when I've actually read the newsletter. I guarantee it'll be more fun.,1
GRANDMA,We could except for the fact that parents day is next Wednesday.,1
LORELAI,Wednesday?,1
RORY,Yup.,1
GRANDMA,If we talked about it on Friday then you would've missed it.,1
LORELAI,Wednesday huh?,1
RORY,"It's ok mom, you don't have to be there.",1
GRANDMA,I guess we can talk about how you missed it.,1
LORELAI,I'm won't miss it.,1
RORY,"Mom it's not a big deal, you're busy.",1
GRANDMA,You know what - I'll go!,1
LORELAI,What?,1
GRANDMA,"Why not? You have to work. I, as you have insinuated, have no life, therefore I will go sit with Rory at parent's day.",1
LORELAI,"I'm not busy, I'm going. I will be there - that's it. End of story ok?",1
GRANDMA,Fine.,1
LORELAI,Fine.,1

RORY,Because it's mine.,1
LORELAI,Oh...right...Hey can I borrow your silver dangly bracelet?,1
RORY,I'll leave it on the table for you.,1
LORELAI,Thank you.,1
LORELAI,What was that?,1
RORY,The door bell rang?,1
LORELAI,Why did the door bell ring?,1
RORY,Because someone's at the door.,1
LORELAI,It's 8 o'clock. Who shows up at 8 o'clock for an 8 o'clock date?,1
RORY,"I don't know, maybe a Chilton teacher?",1
LORELAI,"Everybody knows that 8 o'clock means 8:20, 8:15 tops!",1
RORY,Well obviously he was raised in a barn.,1
LORELAI,"I tell you, he's cute but this punctuality thing has knocked 10 points off the dream guy quotient.",1
RORY,Mom what do I do? I'm not even supposed to be here.,1
LORELAI,Ok so go!,1
LORELAI,Oh wa-wa-wait! You have to get the door.,1
RORY,What?,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, because I'm not ready.",1
RORY,"I'm not supposed to get the door remember, we agreed. I don't get the door when you have a date.",1
LORELAI,I know but...,1
RORY,"I'm not even supposed to be here. That's the first rule of the 'Gilmore Dating Handbook'. . Daughter shall be nowhere near house when said man materializes. It's a good rule, it 's been working.",1
LORELAI,"Ok, but he's standing out there and it's cold and my slip is now completely stuck in my skirt zipper and they'll have to bury me like this.",1
RORY,Mom!,1
LORELAI,Just this once!,1
RORY,Hi.,1
MAX,Rory.,1
RORY,Come on in.,1
MAX,Thank you,1

MAX,I'm fine.,1
RORY,We have water.,1
MAX,That's ok.,1
RORY,It's not bad water actually. I mean it's not a funny colour or anything.,1
MAX,I'm good. Really.,1
RORY,We have bottled water.,1
MAX,"No thanks,",1
RORY,One bottle actually.,1
MAX,I-it's quite alright.,1
RORY,We really need to go to the store.,1
MAX,So..should we...,1
RORY,Sit? Right. Yeah let's sit.,1
MAX,"So, uh, what are your plans tonight?",1
RORY,I'm going over to my friend Lane's house.,1
MAX,Sounds good.,1
RORY,And you guys are...?,1
MAX,"Dinner, movie - the usual.",1
RORY,Right.,1
MAX,This is a little uncomfortable.,1
RORY,Yes it is.,1
MAX,"But the thing is, if things go well, the way I hope they're going, then we might be doing this again.",1
RORY,Sitting uncomfortably?,1
MAX,Seeing each other outside of school.,1
RORY,That's ok. I am fine with this whole you and my mom thing.,1
MAX,Well good. I'm glad.,1
RORY,"Well, better go.",1
MAX,It's good to talk to you Rory.,1
RORY,You too Mr. Medina.,1
MAX,why don't you call me M ax? Just when we're out of school.,1
RORY,I don't think I can do that.,1
MAX,Why not?,1
RORY,"It just sounds wrong - disrespectful. I mean, you're my teacher Mr. Medina, and if I start to think of you as a 'Max' - even as a part-time 'Max', it just seems lit it would get too confusing.",1
MAX,"How 'bout then, we'll come up with non-Chilton names for each other. When we're not in school, I'll call you Rebecca.",1
RORY,Rebecca.,1
MAX,And you'll call me...,1
RORY,Norman?,1
MAX,Norman?,1
RORY,Well...,1
MAX,I look like a Norman to you?,1
RORY,"I'm sorry, 'Psycho' was on earlier and it was just the first name that came to mind. I'll think of something else. How about Alfred?",1
MAX,You know what...Norman's fine.,1
RORY,Are you sure?,1
MAX,"I'm positive, I love it. I might make a legal change.",1
RORY,Ok. Well I better go.,1
MAX,I hope you and Lane have a good time.,1
RORY,"Thanks. Oh, would you give this to my mom for me?",1
MAX,Absolutely.,1
RORY,Thanks.,1
RORY,Oh and Norman - have her home by 10.,1
SOOKIE,I can't believe you won't just sell them to me.,1
JACKSON,And I can't believe you're being so small minded.,1
SOOKIE,My stuffed fried squash blossoms are extremely popular with the customers.,1
JACKSON,Yes I know.,1
SOOKIE,People come from all over and demand the fried stuffed squash blossoms.,1
JACKSON,That's exactly my point!,1
SOOKIE,What'll you have sir? Anything that comes with the stuffed fried squash blossoms. That's what I hear day in and day out.,1
JACKSON,"Yes, great, I know, but all I'm asking you is to try stuffing something a little different this time huh?",1
SOOKIE,A zucchini tush?,1
JACKSON,Just a temporary name.,1
SOOKIE,You want me to serve my customers a genetically engineered vegetable that's named aftera butt?,1
JACKSON,"Hey this is an all natural vegetable hybrid that's perfectly safe, completely delicious, and yes it looks a little odd but you can put in on the map!",1
SOOKIE,I want the blossoms.,1
JACKSON,"Fine. You wanna think small, think small. I'm done.",1
RORY,Jackson invented a new vegetable again?,1
SOOKIE,Yup.,1
RORY,It's too bad that bowling league didn't work out for him.,1
SOOKIE,Yeah.,1
LORELAI,"Hey, look I found them.",1
RORY,Where?,1
LORELAI,They were in that drawer with the roasting pans.,1
RORY,Cool.,1
SOOKIE,Oooh skates!,1
LORELAI,Rory and I have a skating date.,1
RORY,I'm Nancy Kerrigan.,1
LORELAI,And I'm Tonya Harding. I'm gonna do the whole shoe lace coming untie - nervous break - let me start again act and everything.,1
LUKE,When was the last time you put those things on?,1
LORELAI,"Oh, you are constantly trying to ruin my fun.",1
LUKE,Do they even fit anymore?,1
LORELAI,Yes they fit.,1
LUKE,They look rusted.,1
LORELAI,Well...can I just have some coffee please?,1
LUKE,Hand them over.,1
LORELAI,Why?,1
LUKE,I'm gonna clean them and tighten the blades.,1
LORELAI,Really!?!,1
LUKE,Yes.,1
LORELAI,Can you make them really shiny?,1
LUKE,The skates please.,1
LORELAI,Maybe add a couple of pompoms.,1
LUKE,Just hand them over.,1
LORELAI,Thank you!,1
SOOKIE,You get really good service here.,1
LORELAI,Yeah I do.,1
SOOKIE,Gotta go.,1
LORELAI,Anything wrong?,1
SOOKIE,"Too much yeast, too little bowl.",1
LORELAI,Enough said.,1
LORELAI,"So I think I'm just going to go for it and wear the fur-trimmed skating skirt, pride be damned.",1
RORY,"Hey, what if we invite Max to go skating with us?",1
LORELAI,M-max?,1
RORY,"Yeah, I thought maybe he'd want to go.",1
LORELAI,When did you start calling him Max?,1
RORY,"Well the other night he said that I should probably call him something other than Mr. Medina when we're outside of school. Which makes sense, so I'm getting used to saying 'Max'.",1
LORELAI,W- you don't see him that much outside school.,1
RORY,"No, but I probably will since you guys are obsessed with each other.",1
LORELAI,"Yeah, well I wouldn't say 'obsessed'.",1
RORY,"No. It's ok, I mean of all the guys to have hanging around, he seems like a good choice. I like him.",1
LORELAI,"Good, well that's good.",1
RORY,So what do you think about the skating?,1
LORELAI,What?,1
RORY,"Mr. Medina - I'm sorry, Max? Do you think he'd wanna go?",1
LORELAI,I don't thin he skates. Thanks.,1
RORY,Well maybe we could all do something else together.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, good. Something else is good. I love something else.",1
SOOKIE,"Ok, tea is ready. How are the feet?",1
LORELAI,I don't know. They stopped talking to me.,1
SOOKIE,What on earth were you thinking?,1
LORELAI,That I could still skate.,1
SOOKIE,It's not like riding a bike you know.,1
LORELAI,Now you tell me.,1
SOOKIE,"So, what are you up to tonight.",1
LORELAI,"Well, I'm going to do a little line dancing, then run a 10K, then just jump up and down really hard for about an hour.",1
SOOKIE,No Max?,1
LORELAI,No.,1
SOOKIE,Taking a night off?,1
LORELAI,I don't seem him every night Sookie.,1
SOOKIE,He seems like a great guy.,1
LORELAI,He is.,1
SOOKIE,That didn't sound very convincing.,1
LORELAI,"No, he is. He is a great guy - for someone.",1
SOOKIE,For someone?,1
LORELAI,Yes.,1
SOOKIE,Someone else?,1
LORELAI,Yes.,1
SOOKIE,Someone else who is not you although you're the person spending every waking hour with him.,1
LORELAI,Right.,1
SOOKIE,Aha. How long have you been dating?,1
LORELAI,Why?,1
SOOKIE,Two months you've been seeing him right?,1
LORELAI,Point Sookie?,1
SOOKIE,Mmm. Just right on schedule that's all.,1
LORELAI,I have no idea what you're talking about.,1
SOOKIE,This is about the time you start doing you little getaway dance. Two months right on the nose - you're good.,1
LORELAI,I do not do a dance.,1
SOOKIE,You're cha-cha-cha-ing right now.,1
LORELAI,I'm not cha-cha-cha-ing. I'm being practical. Rory is starting to get attached to Max and that's not good.,1
SOOKIE,Oh Rory's getting attached to Max?,1
LORELAI,"Yes and since I've decided that Max is probably not the guy for me, I think it's better that we break it off before she gets hurt.",1
SOOKIE,Practical,1
LORELAI,Yes.,1
SOOKIE,"Uh, can I say something here?",1
LORELAI,Of course you can.,1
SOOKIE,Cha-cha-cha.,1
LORELAI,Stop that.,1
SOOKIE,Livin' la vida loca.,1
LORELAI,Sookie.,1
SOOKIE,"Shake your bon-bon, shake your bon-bon.",1
LORELAI,"Hey, you will not stand there singing Ricky Martin songs to me. This is not a pattern ok? I'm not doing what I always do. This is not the same.",1
SOOKIE,Actually you're right. Usually you don't get so upset and defensive during the cha-cha talk.,1
LORELAI,Ah!,1
SOOKIE,You must really like this guy.,1
LORELAI,When did you become the relationship expert? You haven't been in a relationship in years. . Wow! Zero to jackass in 3.2 seconds.,1
SOOKIE,"That's alright, your feet hurt.",1
LORELAI,No it isn't. It's never ever ok for me to talk to you like that. I'm so so sorry. Please honey.,1
SOOKIE,I understand - really. You know it's not like I don't want a relationship.,1
LORELAI,I know. I didn't mean anything by it.,1
SOOKIE,"It's just - it's hard with my hours. I'm always at the inn, or at the market or at the hospital.",1
LORELAI,Please - forgive me. Do you wanna...sing some more Ricky Martin to me?,1
SOOKIE,No.,1
LORELAI,You can you know - I deserver it.,1
SOOKIE,"'She's into superstition, black cats and voodoo dolls. I've got a premonition, that girl's gonna make me fall.'",1
TRISTIN,You know I heard that Paris' dad's actually got a second family in Paris.,1
GUY,Whoa.,1
TRISTIN,Yeah.,1
MAX,"Uh, Rory?",1
RORY,Hey Mr. Medina.,1
MAX,I enjoyed your paper on Dickenson.,1
RORY,I had fun writing it.,1
MAX,It showed.,1
RORY,Thanks.,1
MAX,"You're welcome Um, Rory?",1
RORY,Yeah?,1
MAX,"No, that's it. That's all I wanted to say.",1
RORY,My name?,1
MAX,Yes.,1
RORY,Ok.,1
MAX,Actually I just wanted to see if Lore- if your mom is coming to parent's day.,1
RORY,Oh well...,1
MAX,Cause I'm just trying to get an accurate number of parents who are coming - you know for the cookie count.,1
MAX,Forget it.,1
RORY,She's coming.,1
MAX,I hadn't heard from her for a while about it and -,1
RORY,She'll be here.,1
MAX,"Ok, good. Good.",1
RORY,But you should put us down for four.,1
MAX,Four what?,1
RORY,Four cookies.,1
MAX,"Ok, good. I will.",1
RORY,Bye.,1
LORELAI,Four slices pepperoni pizza.,1
RORY,From?,1
LORELAI,Tuesday?,1
RORY,Last Tuesday?,1
LORELAI,The Tuesday in the not so distant past.,1
RORY,Toss it. So you remember Paris Geller.,1
LORELAI,Your very best friend in the whole world?,1
RORY,Her parents are getting a major divorce.,1
LORELAI,Really.,1
RORY,Her dad's like this big wig at a huge pharmaceutical company and they're printing all the sordid details about it in the paper.,1
LORELAI,Ooh how sordid?,1
RORY,"Well, it's not the Rich James incident, but Hugh Grant should be feeling pretty good about himself.",1
LORELAI,If she was anyone else in the entire universe I might feel bad for her.,1
RORY,Actually I kind of do feel bad for her.,1
LORELAI,That's because you are the nicest kid ever to walk the earth.,1
RORY,The whole school's talking about it. And the weird thing is that the whole dynamics there has changed for me.,1
LORELAI,Really? How so?,1
RORY,"Well, Madeline and Louise, Paris' best friends, they said hello to me the other day.",1
LORELAI,Really? Like a normal hello? Not like a 'Here's Johnny' kind of hello?,1
RORY,"Normal, friendly, no acts.",1
LORELAI,"Wow, you're the new 'Heather'",1
RORY,I guess.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, hey, this is the pizza from mystery Tuesday. That one's completely fine",1
RORY,Don't.,1
LORELAI,It's in the box!,1
RORY,Oscar!,1
LORELAI,Felix!,1
RORY,Forget it!,1
LORELAI,Fine.,1
RORY,So how's 'Swann's Way' coming.,1
LORELAI,Oh finished.,1
RORY,You're kidding! It took me forever to read that. I had to renew it 10 times.,1
LORELAI,The first sentence - I finished the first sentence.,1
RORY,Aha.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah - it's just - I'm so swamped right now you know, it's the totally wrong time to start reading the longest book known to man. Hey maybe you could give it back to Max for me?",1
RORY,Just bring it with you tomorrow.,1
LORELAI,Tomorrow?,1
RORY,Parent's day?,1
LORELAI,I know I'm just - I'm not sure I'm going to be able to make it.,1
RORY,What do you mean?,1
LORELAI,Well I have that thing at the inn and I thought I could get away and now I can't.,1
RORY,What thing?,1
LORELAI,The thing - the inn thing?,1
RORY,What inn thing?,1
LORELAI,You know.,1
RORY,No I don't.,1
LORELAI,The thing at the inn with the flags and the little men and the peanuts - the thing.,1
RORY,Little men?,1
LORELAI,"Forget it, it's not important - I just don't think I can go.",1
RORY,"Ok, fine.",1
LORELAI,"So, if you could give this book back to Max tomorrow - that would be great.",1
RORY,Why don't you just give it back to him the next time you see him.,1
LORELAI,Because I'm not sure when that would be and he should have his book.,1
RORY,You see him all the time.,1
LORELAI,"Rory, could you just give it back to him ok?",1
RORY,Are you breaking up with him?,1
LORELAI,What are you talking about?,1
RORY,Well he hasn't heard from you and now you're asking me to give him the book back.,1
LORELAI,How do you know he hasn't heard from me?,1
RORY,He wanted to know if you were going to Parent's day and then he mentioned that you guys hadn't talked lately.,1
LORELAI,He shouldn't be asking you about me.,1
RORY,Why are you breaking up with him?,1
LORELAI,Because it's not working out.,1
RORY,But you seemed so happy.,1
LORELAI,It's not right - that's all.,1
RORY,So that's why you're not going tomorrow?,1
LORELAI,"No, I'm not going tomorrow because of the thing at the inn.",1
RORY,That's crap and you know it,1
LORELAI,Hey -,1
RORY,"There is no thing at the inn, you're avoiding Mr. Medina and you're trying to lie to me and you promised you would go and - hey, do whatever you want. I don't care, just leave me out of it. And give him the book back yourself.",1
LORELAI,Fine I will.,1
LORELAI,"Hey, not so fast.",1
RORY,The bell's gonna ring.,1
LORELAI,Before you go one more step - tell me you like me?,1
RORY,You bug me.,1
LORELAI,I'll take that as a yes. And I want you to know that I will deal with my issues with Max myself.,1
RORY,Fine.,1
LORELAI,Really.,1
RORY,I believe you.,1
LORELAI,So where are we going?,1
RORY,To my locker to drop off some of this stuff.,1
LORELAI,"Great, let's do it.",1
PARIS,You can't just leave now.,1
MOM,Paris please.,1
PARIS,At least come to my lit class.,1
MOM,This place is giving me a h eadache.,1
PARIS,Mom.,1
MOM,Is your face breaking out?,1
PARIS,No.,1
MOM,You have not being using that cleanser have you? Now Dr. Yanalari prescribed that cleanser for a reason - to cleanse.,1
PARIS,Just lit class.,1
MOM,Paris with everything I have going on right now the last thing I need to do is face a bunch of bored people who are gossiping about me. I'll see you later at home. Use that cover stick I got you.,1
LORELAI,I bet I'm looking pretty good to you right now.,1
RORY,Yes you are.,1
LORELAI,Hmm. So what's first? Wait don't tell me.,1
RORY,English lit with Mr. Max Medina.,1
LORELAI,Ok see I told you not to tell me.,1
RORY,Sorry,1
LORELAI,Mr. Medina's class huh?,1
RORY,The fancy book owner himself.,1
LORELAI,How does first annual mother/daughter ditch day sound?,1
RORY,Not happening.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah yeah, ok - let's go.",1
MAX,"On Monday we will start a two week of creative writing exercise, but that doesn't mean we stop reading. One of the greatest inspirations of working writers is the writing of other that they admire. Walt Whitman read Homer, Dante, Shakespeare. And the novelist Edna O'Brien has been quoted as saying 'that every writer should read some Proust every day' Now, at this point, normally I would impress the partens by pulling out a copy of Proust's 'Swann's Way' and reading a particularly difficult passage but alas, you're all saved. I have misplaced my copy. Oh that does is - parent's thanks for coming, students - papers on Whitman are due tomorrow and those of you who are just starting tonight - I'll be able to tell.",1
LORELAI,So you go on ahead ok? I'm going to talk to Max for a second.,1
RORY,Please be nice.,1
LORELAI,"I will, I will.",1
LORELAI,Hi.,1
MAX,Hi - it's nice to see you.,1
LORELAI,Yeah. I've been really busy.,1
MAX,Oh sure - I assumed.,1
LORELAI,I wanted to give this back to you.,1
MAX,Keep it.,1
LORELAI,"I really liked it. I like the first 20 pages anyway, then I got busy and I can see you really need it so -",1
MAX,What's going on Lorelai?,1
LORELAI,Nothing. I just don't think a book whose first sentence is 20 pages long is for me.,1
MAX,Well I left four messages,1
LORELAI,I know - I've been meaning to call.,1
MAX,What's been keeping you?,1
LORELAI,I don't know - things.,1
MAX,Uh huh.,1
LORELAI,Sorry.,1
MAX,Sorry?,1
LORELAI,That I didn't call.,1
MAX,Ok.,1
LORELAI,So - here.,1
MAX,Why do you keep on trying to give me the book?,1
LORELAI,Because it's yours.,1
MAX,Is there something going on here that I don't know about?,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, uh I hate Proust.",1
MAX,Lorelai?,1
LORELAI,"Look, um Rory's out there waiting for me so...",1
MAX,Wa-wait a minute...Oh my God! I cannot believe what an idiot I am.,1
LORELAI,What?,1
MAX,You're breaking up with me ar en't you?,1
LORELAI,I don't know.,1
MAX,"Not only are you breaking up with me, you're doing it really badly.",1
LORELAI,Am I being graded?,1
MAX,"No, I'm a little disappointed. I would've expected a better dumping from you.",1
LORELAI,Nobody's dumping anyone.,1
MAX,Really? Then what is this?,1
LORELAI,I just need space.,1
MAX,Well I don't. In fact I want as little space as possible. 100 clowns crammed into a Volkswagen. That's the kind of non-space I'm talking about.,1
LORELAI,It's not working.,1
MAX,It was working pretty good the other night.,1
LORELAI,"Look it is what I've been trying to tell you all along. This is a family. Rory and I, you walked into a family, but you weren't listening and now she's getting attached and I'm afraid she's gonna get hurt.",1
MAX,So you solution to all of this is not to return my calls,1
LORELAI,It just took me a w hile to figure things out and it all came clear when I realized how much we could hurt Rory.,1
MAX,Don't you mean how much we could hurt Lorelai?,1
LORELAI,Hey - I can take care of myself.,1
MAX,I don't understand this. I thought we went through this. W-we decided she could handle it.,1
LORELAI,Well maybe she can and maybe she can't. I'm not ready to find out.,1
MAX,I'm not going to let you off that easily.,1
LORELAI,Well there's nothing you can do about it.,1
MAX,There has to be.,1
LORELAI,There isn't.,1
MAX,There is.,1
LORELAI,Well no there isn't.,1
MAX,Yes there is.,1
LORELAI,What are we in high school? Well I know we are in a high school.,1
MAX,This is so not you.,1
LORELAI,"Well, you don't know everything about me.",1
MAX,"I guess not, because I would've thought that blaming this all on Rory and giving me these lame apologies was weak, pathetic and beneath you.",1
LORELAI,Just take you damn book,1
MAX,You've missed me.,1
LORELAI,Stop it.,1
MAX,"I know you did, you're missing me right now aren't you?",1
MAX,Answer me.,1
LORELAI,Look class is over -,1
MAX,Well we're back in session.,1
LORELAI,"Well I didn't raise my hand so don't call on me! I came here to give you this book back, please take it.",1
MAX,I swear to God if you try to give me that book one more time...,1
RORY,What's going on?,1
PARIS,"Oh, everyone's just talking about the mom that Mr. Medina was seen kissing just now.",1
RORY,What?,1
PARIS,And the weird thing is - she looks a lot like your mom.,1
RORY,What are you talking about?,1
PARIS,"Your mom - Mr. Medina, mouths open. I saw them. How's the coleslaw? Good?",1
LORELAI,"Hey, did you save me some jello?",1
LORELAI,What? Rory?! Hey where are you gong?,1
RORY,Were you kissing him?,1
LORELAI,What?,1
RORY,"Mr. Medina, just now, were you kissing him?",1
LORELAI,Yes.,1
RORY,What the hell is wrong with you?,1
LORELAI,I don't know.,1
RORY,You said you were breaking up with him.,1
LORELAI,I was.,1
RORY,I know I told you to be nice to him but this was a little extreme don't you think?,1
LORELAI,It wasn't supposed to happen.,1
RORY,Paris saw you! It's all over the school!,1
LORELAI,"Oh God - oh Rory, I'm so sorry. I really am. See this is exactly why I didn't want to date him.",1
RORY,You didn't want to date him so you wouldn't come to my school and kiss him and humiliate me?,1
LORELAI,Yes that's exactly it.,1
RORY,Why would you do this?,1
LORELAI,"Because I'm human, because I screwed up. I'm sorry.",1
RORY,If you like him so much then why are you breaking up with him?,1
LORELAI,"Look, I broke the rules when I brought him into our lives and I realize now that that was a very bad idea.",1
RORY,But why?,1
LORELAI,"Why?! Because we are standing in this stairwell yelling at each other that's why! Because it's affecting you, it's seeping into your life and that is the whole reason I made these rules in the first place. Is-is to protect you!",1
RORY,"You know what, maybe it was a good idea that you hid your personal life from me when I was a kid but I'm not a kid anymore.",1
LORELAI,"No, you're right. You're a 40 year old divorcee - my mistake.",1
RORY,Ugh! I can't believe you're blaming this on me!,1
LORELAI,I'm not blaming you!,1
RORY,You made up these stupid rules years ago about the way the Gilmore women would run their lives and now you're sticking to them even though they're crazy!,1
LORELAI,"Oh hey my crazy, stupid rules are the reason we're doing so good in our lives. They're the reason you grew up the way you did, the reason you're even in this school and the reason you're going to go to Harvard so don't you dismiss my rules.",1
RORY,"Fine! Great! Well, maybe it's time for the rules to change!",1
LORELAI,"Yes, well that's for me to figure out, not you!",1
RORY,Great! Fine! Well could you figure it out before French class because I'd rather you didn't start making out with Mrs. Collins.,1
LORELAI,Hey no promises until I see what she looks like!,1
LORELAI,"Look, let's just refrain from fighting in front of the grandmother ok?",1
RORY,Fine with me.,1
LORELAI,The last thing I need tonight is a confrontation with my mother,1
LORELAI,"Hi mom, boy the roads were a mess out there tonight.",1
GRANDMA,Rory go upstairs please.,1
RORY,Is everything ok?,1
GRANDMA,"I have to talk to your mother, please go upstairs.",1
RORY,Well -,1
GRANDMA,Now Rory.,1
GRANDMA,Lorelai come here!,1
LORELAI,"Gee mom, did I do something wrong?",1
GRANDMA,"I try to understand you, I truly do. But sometimes your behaviour baffles me beyond belief.",1
LORELAI,And which behaviour is this?,1
GRANDMA,Do you have no shame?,1
LORELAI,Is that intended as a rhetorical question or - ?,1
GRANDMA,"Rory goes to school in that place, she has a reputation to protect. You're her mother.",1
LORELAI,How did you -,1
GRANDMA,You're supposed to shield her from shame not cause it.,1
LORELAI,Oh mom?,1
GRANDMA,Kissing a teacher...in a classroom...on parent's day!,1
LORELAI,Well...they wanted us to get more involved with the school.,1
GRANDMA,Are you insane?,1
LORELAI,No but you are if you think I'm discussing this with you.,1
GRANDMA,When I heard I almost fainted.,1
LORELAI,How did you hear mom?,1
GRANDMA,I have friends Lorelai. Headmaster Charleston's wife for one.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, that's great.",1
GRANDMA,"The entire school is talking about it. And what do I say, how do I defend this?",1
LORELAI,It was a mistake.,1
GRANDMA,A mistake? A mistake? Is that what you call it a mistake?,1
LORELAI,Well I tried to call it 'Al' but it would only answer to 'mistake'.,1
GRANDMA,"A mistake is when you throw out your credit card bill - a mistake is when you forget to RSVP to a dinner party - a mistake is when the gardeners miss trash day and the barrels are full for a week. This my girl, was not a mistake! Do you even know this man?",1
LORELAI,"Ah, no, this is the first time I'd seen him and I don't know, there was just something about the way he held the chalk and -",1
GRANDMA,This is not the time for your jokes.,1
LORELAI,Yes I knew him. I've been dating him.,1
GRANDMA,Why on earth would you date Rory's teacher?,1
LORELAI,That's none of your business.,1
GRANDMA,It most certainly is.,1
LORELAI,How do you figure that?,1
GRANDMA,When it affects my granddaughter it becomes my business.,1
LORELAI,I don't want to talk about this with you!,1
GRANDMA,I just want to know what you were thinking. What was the reasoning? How on earth did you justify it to yourself?,1
LORELAI,"Max is a great guy. An amazing guy! He's smart, he's sweet he cooks.",1
GRANDMA,So you decided to kiss him in your daughter's school.,1
LORELAI,"No, I decided to breakup with him in my daughter's school and the kissing part just happened.",1
GRANDMA,You always let your emotions get in the way. That's the problem with you Lorelai - you don't think.,1
LORELAI,Mom - please.,1
GRANDMA,He's just a man Lorelai.,1
LORELAI,No he's not.,1
GRANDMA,"Oh so what are you telling me. That this was all worth it because he was the love of you life, that this was the man for you.",1
LORELAI,I don't know. He might have been. Excuse me,1
LOUISE,"See, I told you he wouldn't date a teacher.",1
PARIS,"I wish my mom would sleep with my teacher, it would make midterms a lot easier.",1
RORY,"Madeline, Louise, would you excuse us for a minute?",1
LOUISE,Ooh cat fight.,1
RORY,Go.,1
PARIS,You're not going to kiss me ar e you?,1
RORY,What's wrong with you?,1
PARIS,Nothing I'm great.,1
RORY,"You've just spent the past two weeks with all of your family's private problems printed in the newspaper for everyone to read and talk about. I saw how you walked around here! I saw how much you hated it. And then you turn around and pull something like this? Doesn't that seem crazy to you? Do you have any idea how many people you've hurt? Forget me and my mom, what about Mr. Medina? He likes you, he encourages you. He hold up your papers and tells the class how great you are. And then you turn around and spread stories about him. . Whatever, forget it. You have no idea what I'm talking about.",1
PARIS,I do like Mr. Medina.,1
RORY,Well I'd take some dance lessons cause the way you express yourself needs a little work.,1
PARIS,I...probably shouldn't have told people what I saw.,1
RORY,No you shouldn't have.,1
PARIS,I'm sorry...things have been...well...not good lately.,1
RORY,I know.,1
PARIS,"I just didn't want them talking about me anymore, that's all.",1
RORY,"Well, it worked.",1
PARIS,Yeah.,1
RORY,"You know, i-if you want to talk -",1
PARIS,"Hey, we are not friends.",1
RORY,Oh that I know. But if you ever do...want to talk about -,1
PARIS,"I will, if I want to.",1
RORY,Ok.,1
PARIS,But I probably won't.,1
RORY,That's fine.,1
PARIS,But if I do -,1
RORY,I'm around.,1
PARIS,Ok. I'm going now.,1
RORY,Bye.,1
PARIS,Bye.,1
PARIS,I doubt I will.,1
RORY,I'm not holding my breath.,1
JACKSON,There - squash blossoms. All large enough for you to stuff and fry up and serve to the desensitize masses who just want what they know. Hurrah! Mediocrity wins again!,1
SOOKIE,Jackson?,1
JACKSON,"You know what, I'm not even gonna charge you for these. I am not going to profit off the death of creativity. I would rather starve myself than know that my food was paid for by the lowered expectations of the American public.",1
SOOKIE,Jackson?,1
JACKSON,What?!,1
SOOKIE,Would you like to go to dinner sometimes...with me?,1
JACKSON,Ok.,1
SOOKIE,Ok.,1
MAX,Thanks,1
LORELAI,"Hey Mister, wanna buy a really nice copy of Proust?",1
MAX,How ya doing?,1
LORELAI,Hmm. Well you know. You?,1
MAX,Well you know it also.,1
LORELAI,So that parent's day is fun.,1
MAX,"Oh, it was a big hit this year",1
LORELAI,"Look, the other day, we were going skating, and Rory said ""Why don't we invite Max to come al ong with us"" and that was a little weird for me.",1
MAX,Me too. I don't skate.,1
LORELAI,"She's never really referred to anyone I've dated by their first name before. I always kept her out of that part of my life, so it was like ""the mustache guy"", ""the earring guy"", ""the peg leg guy"".",1
MAX,Oh so you have a thing for pirates.,1
LORELAI,"She never called anyone by their name before. She likes you. She likes us. So my mind instantly went to ""Oh my God, what if we break up, she'll be crushed"" and then my next thought was ""Oh my God, what if we break up, I'll be crushed"". And then as you know all hell broke loose.",1
MAX,I understand.,1
LORELAI,"I freaked out. I'm so sorry. I never meant to treat you like that, I'm not very good at this, ask Skippy.",1
MAX,Skippy?,1
LORELAI,I'm so so sorry.,1
MAX,I was called into headmaster Charleston's office today.,1
LORELAI,"Let me guess. He put his arm around you and said ""I don't understand why you crazy kids can't work this out?""",1
MAX,He said that I was jeopardizing my career and future at Chilton.,1
LORELAI,Oh!,1
MAX,"At first I was incensed, outraged and ""How dare he?!"". And then I realized that he was right. What happened the other day was completely unprofessional. I never in my life would've considered pulling off something like this. He should've fired me.",1
LORELAI,But he didn't.,1
MAX,"Not yet, but the word 'probation' was tossed around quite a bit though.",1
LORELAI,I'm sorry.,1
MAX,I'm the one that started the kiss.,1
LORELAI,And I'm the one that knocked it up to NC-17.,1
MAX,I honestly did not think that this was going to be so complicated.,1
LORELAI,I know.,1
MAX,"I mean you told it would be. I didn't listen, I didn't want to.",1
LORELAI,"It's not your fault. If I hadn't acted like a two year old and tried to run away and pretend that you weren't what you are to me, then we wouldn't have fought, we wouldn't have kissed, I wouldn't have humiliated my daughter and the whole thing would've been fine.",1
MAX,I do not know what to do here. I-I've never been in a relationship like this before. I'm not thinking straight.,1
LORELAI,"I know, me eit her.",1
MAX,That was a great kiss.,1
LORELAI,Beyond great.,1
MAX,Maybe we need to take a little time away from each other.,1
LORELAI,Ok.,1
MAX,"You know, just to figure out how to do this so it's not so hard.",1
LORELAI,Sure...that makes sense.,1
MAX,I just - I don't have any other answers right now.,1
LORELAI,No you're right. You're absolutely right. I really really like you Max Medina,1
MAX,I really really like you Lorelai Gilmore.,1
LORELAI,,1
MAX,Goodbye Lorelai,1
LORELAI,Bye.,1

RORY,,1
RORY,"Wow, you went new-cd crazy!",1
LANE,They just had an amazing selection today.,1
RORY,The best of Blondie...Kraftwerk...Young Marble Giants...Yoko Ono - really?,1
LANE,A very misunderstood artist and the Beattles would've broken up anyways.,1
RORY,Have you shared this theory with anyone?,1
LANE,"I know it, Yoko knows it, Sean knows it. Julian's still in denial but what can you do?",1
RORY,"Ok, I must listen to anyone named Claudine Longet",1
LANE,Rory...,1
RORY,Yes Lane?,1
LANE,I have a favor to ask you.,1
Posted,01/30/01 17:36,1
RORY,Uh huh?,1
LANE,Well you know Dean?,1
RORY,My boyfriend?,1
LANE,Yes.,1
RORY,Yes I do.,1
LANE,Ok...well rememb er I was telling you about his friend Todd?,1
RORY,Todd. Yes.,1
LANE,Have you met him?,1
RORY,No.,1
LANE,Well he's cool.,1
RORY,Good.,1
LANE,Really cool.,1
RORY,Good again.,1
LANE,"Really, really cool.",1
RORY,Good still holds.,1
LANE,So cool in fact that it brings me to the next question,1
LORELAI,Hey. I'm studying in there...,1
RORY,I know.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah. I have like 6,000 pages of case studies to memorize and this whole big test on the Wal-Mart phenomena coming up on Friday and because I have a life and a job and business school's not the only thing I have to concentrate on I'm behind, and I'll probably fail and then that little 18 year old annoying knat who sits behind me will get another  A' and make that   I'm smart you're dumb' fact to me for the rest of the week and I'll be very upset and will possibly cry.",1
RORY,The music's too loud.,1
LORELAI,Yes.,1
RORY,Got it.,1
LORELAI,Thank you,1
LANE,"So anyhow, I was wondering if you could talk to Dean about maybe talking to Todd about me.",1
RORY,I guess.,1
LANE,And then maybe you could ask Dean to ask him out - for me.,1
RORY,"Good, cause I don't think Dean would want to go out with Todd. Might screw up their friendship.",1
LANE,And then I was thinking that this date could maybe happen this weekend.,1
RORY,Huh.,1
LANE,Sunday preferably.,1
RORY,Well -,1
LANE,After church.,1
RORY,Lane -,1
LANE,But don't mention church.,1
RORY,"Ok, hold on a sec -",1
LANE,Unless he's into church.,1
LORELAI,"Hey, uh, now it's too quiet.",1
RORY,I'll turn it up.,1
LORELAI,Thank you,1
RORY,Ok.,1
LANE,So what do you think?,1
LORELAI,Who the hell is that anyways?,1
RORY,Claudine Longet.,1
LORELAI,The chick who shot the skier?,1
RORY,"Uh, sure, why not.",1
LORELAI,Wow - renaissance woman,1
RORY,You want me to set you up with Todd?,1
LANE,Yes and I was thinking that you and Dean could come out with us so that it's not that big of a deal.,1
RORY,Oh.,1
LANE,You don't want to do it?,1
RORY,No I -,1
LANE,"That's ok, I understand - no big deal. Hey Grand Daddy new album used - I love a bargain.",1
RORY,I just really don't know this Todd guy.,1
LANE,I do.,1
RORY,You've met him twice,1
LANE,But the 3rd time's a charm,1
RORY,How do you know this guy's right for you?,1
LANE,"I know, I'm telling you. We're talking soul mate here.",1
RORY,"The last time you met you soul mate, you ran your fingers through his hair and ended up hiding at my house for the evening.",1
LANE,Well I still have my key.,1
RORY,Lane?,1
LANE,"Look, I made a mistake with Rich Bloomenfeld. Everybody's allowed one mistake. But Todd, Todd is different.",1
RORY,He is?,1
LANE,First of all his name is Todd - Different name different guy,1
LORELAI,"Ok so, how important is this whole business school thing anyway? I mean, so what if I never run my own inn? I like my job, I like my house, I like my life. And I certainly don't want to be one of those people who's never satisfied with what they have you know? I mean some people don't have legs or arms. I have legs and arms. What more could I possibly want than legs and arms? I mean, I could take all the classes in the world, that's still not going to give me what I already have.",1
RORY,Legs and arms.,1
LORELAI,Yes. Am I sounding completely crazy?,1
RORY,Yes you are.,1
LORELAI,Wal-Mart is boring!,1
RORY,Study!,1
LORELAI,Aah!,1
LANE,So?,1
RORY,So?,1
LANE,Rory?,1
RORY,Ok.,1
LANE,Really?,1
RORY,"Yes, Yoko",1
LORELAI,,1
LORELAI,Yes Michel?,1
MICHELorelai,I apologize for any inconvenience I might be causing your future employment but your current one is experiencing a problem.,1
LORELAI,And once again I say 'Yes Michel?',1
MICHELorelai,Are you sure you wouldn't like me to wait?,1
LORELAI,No Michel.,1
MICHELorelai,Because learning the eating patterns of the average Taco Bell consumer is a vital lesson that -,1
LORELAI,Michel. What do you want?,1
MICHELorelai,We are overbooked.,1
LORELAI,How are we overbooked?,1
MICHELorelai,Well there are more people here than there are rooms to put them in.,1
LORELAI,I don't understand this.,1
MICHELorelai,Well I cannot describe it any simpler than I already have.,1
LORELAI,Well where did the Rucker's come from?,1
MICHELorelai,Well judging from their clothing a town where high rubber fishing boots and spittoons would be considered formal wear.,1
LORELAI,"Ok, put them in the Jefferson suite tonight, move them back to their previously booked room tomorrow and offer them dinner on the house for the inconvenience.",1
MICHELorelai,Very well.,1
LORELAI,I'm gonna get some mo re coffee if you need me.,1
MICHELorelai,"I'll try and manage while you're gone, though God knows it won't be easy.",1
LORELAI,Coffee?,1
SOOKIE,Yes.,1
LORELAI,Great.,1
SOOKIE,Necesito las hojas grandes.,1
LORELAI,Oh! Meringue.,1
SOOKIE,"Yeah, I thought I'd do a variation on a baked Alaska for dessert tonight.",1
LORELAI,What kind of variation?,1
SOOKIE,See I hadn't thought of that yet.,1
LORELAI,Maybe you could do them in the actual shape of Alaska.,1
SOOKIE,Interesting.,1
LORELAI,Or you could do little baked Alaskas and Hawaiis,1
SOOKIE,Because they joined the union last.,1
LORELAI,Exactly.,1
JACKSON,Oh,1
SOOKIE,Jackson.,1
JACKSON,Sookie - hello.,1
SOOKIE,Hello.,1
LORELAI,Hey.,1
JACKSON,I brought you um -,1
SOOKIE,"Yeah, well great. Just put them down there.",1
JACKSON,"Right. Oh, yes How's that?",1
SOOKIE,"That's great, that's just perfect. I really like them there.",1
JACKSON,Yeah they - they do look good there don't they?,1
SOOKIE,Yes they do.,1
JACKSON,Ok. Well I should -,1
SOOKIE,"Uh, squash.",1
JACKSON,What?,1
SOOKIE,I need some.,1
JACKSON,Squash.,1
SOOKIE,,1
PattypanJACKSON,"Ok, tomorrow?",1
SOOKIE,Same time?,1
JACKSON,If that's good for you?,1
SOOKIE,"It is, it's perfect.",1
JACKSON,"Ok then, I-I'll see you tomorrow with the pattypan.",1
SOOKIE,Great.,1
JACKSON,Yes.,1
LORELAI,Ok so...who walked in on who naked?,1
SOOKIE,Oh God this is horrible! He comes in and - horrible.,1
LORELAI,What's going on between you two?,1
SOOKIE,I asked him if he'd like to have dinner sometime.,1
LORELAI,I know - weeks ago.,1
SOOKIE,And he said yes.,1
LORELAI,Which is good.,1
SOOKIE,"But since there's not definite plan or date attached, now the invitation is just out there floating in the universe.",1
LORELAI,So make a definite plan.,1
SOOKIE,I can't.,1
LORELAI,Why?,1
SOOKIE,Because what if he says no?,1
LORELAI,He already said yes.,1
SOOKIE,"Yes to the amorphous, theoretical, 'Let's maybe sometime go out and do something not too specific' proposition. But dinner and a movie - it's concrete. It's real, he might say no.",1
LORELAI,I doubt he will.,1
SOOKIE,Well why hasn't he asked me?,1
LORELAI,"I don't know, maybe he thinks you've changed your mind since you asked.",1
SOOKIE,Well why would he think that?,1
LORELAI,Because you haven't mentioned it again.,1
SOOKIE,"But I mentioned it once, it's his turn.",1
LORELAI,"Alright, let's say it is his turn, you can spend a lot of time sitting around waiting for him to realize it's his turn, or you can just run with the wolves and make it your turn again.",1
SOOKIE,I don't want it to be my turn again.,1
LORELAI,You just wanna let this opportunity pass?,1
SOOKIE,I wanna be the girl.,1
LORELAI,You are the girl. That's why we're having this very confusing conversation.,1
SOOKIE,You think I should ask him out?,1
LORELAI,On Sunday.,1
SOOKIE,Why Sunday?,1
LORELAI,Because that's your day off.,1
SOOKIE,Ok.,1
LORELAI,Now.,1
SOOKIE,What?,1
LORELAI,I think you should do it now before you lose your nerve.,1
SOOKIE,Well he's not back to his office yet.,1
LORELAI,Does he have a cell phone?,1
SOOKIE,Yes.,1
LORELAI,You know people buy cell phones for exactly this reason - so you could get a hold of them anytime you want.,1
SOOKIE,I thought people bought cell phones in case their cars broke down at night and they needed to call someone for help and there's psycho K*llers -,1
LORELAI,Call him.,1
SOOKIE,Call him?,1
LORELAI,Call him Sookie.,1
SOOKIE,Call him,1
LORELAI,"Mmm, she knows his number by heart.",1
SOOKIE,He is my produce guy.,1
LORELAI,Very convenient excuse.,1
SOOKIE,"He - Oh Jackson? It's Sookie. I was wondering if you could call me back when you get a chance, sooner rather than later, it's not an emergency so don't freak out or anything. The carrots still look good. It seems like it's almost a shame to eat them, sort of like you should put them in a vase or -",1
LORELAI,"Sookie, hang up. Hang up.",1
SOOKIE,"Call me, bye. Got his voice mail.",1
LORELAI,Ok good. It give you time to prepare what you're going to say. Maybe have a few suggestions ready of places to go.,1
SOOKIE,Date prep time.,1
LORELAI,Yes.,1
SOOKIE,Ok good. I'm good at that. I'm good at prep.,1
LORELAI,Sookie...spoon.,1
SOOKIE,,1
DEAN,Is there anything in there about me?,1
RORY,I don't know. You name w ouldn't be Lithium would it?,1
DEAN,Aren't you supposed to be in school?,1
RORY,We had a half day today - teacher conferences. So I thought I'd come by and surprise you.,1
DEAN,Well you know how much I hate surprises.,1
RORY,"Yes, I'm very sorry.",1
DEAN,That's for surprising me.,1
RORY,I have learned my lesson.,1
RORY,I have to talk to you about something.,1
DEAN,"Ok, I have to talk to you about something too. Come here",1
RORY,Ok stop.,1
DEAN,Sorry.,1
RORY,No stay!,1
DEAN,Why?,1
RORY,Because I really need to talk to you about something.,1
DEAN,Alright.,1
RORY,It's about Todd.,1
DEAN,What about him?,1
RORY,What do you think of him?,1
DEAN,He's my friend.,1
RORY,I know.,1
DEAN,So that would signify a positive impression.,1
RORY,Right. Ok. Good.,1
DEAN,"Yes, can I kiss you now?",1
RORY,I'm not done yet.,1
DEAN,Fine. Go ahead.,1
RORY,Well you know Lane.,1
DEAN,"Yeah, I do.",1
RORY,She likes Todd.,1
DEAN,Ok.,1
RORY,And I think that they would really hit it off.,1
DEAN,You - you don't even know Todd.,1
RORY,No but you do. And you like him - you said so.,1
DEAN,I did.,1
RORY,Ok then. There you go.,1
DEAN,I would - I would really like to kiss you now.,1
RORY,Yeah so would I.,1
DEAN,"Ok, good. We agree",1
RORY,I think we should set them up.,1
DEAN,Todd and Lane?,1
RORY,Yeah. We could all go out together - like to a movie or something on Sunday.,1
DEAN,Rory -,1
RORY,It would be really casual - no big deal.,1
DEAN,I just -,1
RORY,What?,1
DEAN,"I mean, I'm just not sure that I see them together.",1
RORY,You don't think Todd would like Lane?,1
DEAN,I'm not sure.,1
RORY,Lane is great.,1
DEAN,"Yeah, I know.",1
RORY,She's my best friend.,1
DEAN,"Yeah, I-I know that.",1
RORY,Todd should be so lucky to get a girl like her.,1
DEAN,I didn't mean -,1
RORY,I mean I can't believe that you don't think that she's good enough -,1
DEAN,"No, no, no -",1
RORY,or I don't know pretty enough.,1
DEAN,I didn't say anything about her not being pretty enough -,1
RORY,Well you did -,1
DEAN,Let me finish. I just don't know if he'll like her because I don't know what kind of girl he likes.,1
RORY,Well -,1
DEAN,"But if you want to do this, then I'll talk to him.",1
RORY,You will?,1
DEAN,Yeah.,1
RORY,And you'll mention Sunday?,1
DEAN,I will mention Sunday.,1
RORY,Thank you.,1
DEAN,You're welcome. So...was that it?,1
RORY,Yeah that was it.,1
DEAN,Then can we...,1
RORY,,1
LORELAI,I give up.,1
MICHELorelai,That's the spirit.,1
LORELAI,I can't rememb er any of this crap.,1
MICHELorelai,"Well, not everyone is cut out to be their own boss. Maybe you are more of a worker bee, a follower, a ticket ripper, or the man at the concert with the orange glow stick directing you were to park.",1
LORELAI,You're baiting me ar en't you?,1
MICHELorelai,"No, I seriously have no faith in your aptitude.",1
SOOKIE,He called! He called!,1
LORELAI,And?,1
SOOKIE,"Well, I did what you said. I had it all worked out and I asked him if he'd like to go to dinner at Chez Fleur on Sunday.",1
LORELAI,Chez Fleur very nice.,1
SOOKIE,"Hm, thank you. He said he would love to.",1
LORELAI,Oh great!,1
SOOKIE,He said he would love to but his cousin's in town and he's staying with him for the week.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, well then just make it next week.",1
SOOKIE,"Yes, see that would've been a good option had I thought of it when I was on the phone, but instead - I came up with another option.",1
LORELAI,Which is?,1
SOOKIE,That we double date with his cousin Rune and you.,1
LORELAI,What?,1
SOOKIE,"Yes, ok, not as good as your option I agree. But it seemed pretty good at the time - though I wasn't standing here watching you make that face.",1
LORELAI,Sookie no. I hate blind dates.,1
SOOKIE,"I know, but this isn't a blind date. This is you keeping his cousin company while I have a date with Jackson.",1
LORELAI,Oh God.,1
SOOKIE,Lorelai please. I'll be your best friend.,1
LORELAI,You are my best friend.,1
SOOKIE,And you're mine.,1
LORELAI,I know I am.,1
SOOKIE,So what are best friends for?,1
LORELAI,Ok.,1
SOOKIE,Yes?,1
LORELAI,"Yes, I'll go.",1
SOOKIE,"Thank you, thank you, thank you. You will not regret this.",1
LORELAI,Pick another phrase.,1
SOOKIE,You will not have to pay,1
LORELAI,,1
LORELAI,Rory?,1
RORY,What?,1
LORELAI,Diva Glam.,1
RORY,I've got it.,1
LORELAI,Bring it up. Hold still.,1
SOOKIE,Not too much.,1
LORELAI,No - just enough to say  hey sailor',1
SOOKIE,My stomach doesn't feel so great. I think I've got the flu.,1
LORELAI,I think you're nervous.,1
RORY,Here.,1
LORELAI,Thank you.,1
RORY,I need the sparkly hair clips,1
LORELAI,"Ok, I'll find them in a minute.",1
RORY,You look pretty.,1
LORELAI,I do?,1
RORY,Uh huh.,1
SOOKIE,Oh thank you. I should cancel.,1
LORELAI,"Ok, let's do you lips first.",1
SOOKIE,What if I'm mak ing an idiot out of myself.,1
LORELAI,By going out on a date?,1
SOOKIE,With my produce guy.,1
LORELAI,You like him.,1
SOOKIE,But what if tonight is a disaster and them he won't sell to me anymore.,1
LORELAI,"Oh my God, you're right.",1
SOOKIE,"Yes, see!",1
LORELAI,"And since all the produce in the entire world is in his possession and all the produce that will be grown in the future will be in his possession, then we will never again be able to get any produce and all our vegetarian clients will die.",1
SOOKIE,I'm scared.,1
LORELAI,I know.,1
SOOKIE,I like him.,1
LORELAI,He likes you.,1
SOOKIE,How do you know he's not being polite?,1
LORELAI,Sookie!,1
SOOKIE,No I mean it. It's like I cornered him and he felt trapped and he had to say yes.,1
LORELAI,He did not have to say yes.,1
SOOKIE,Oh my God. Technically I am his employer.,1
LORELAI,Sookie!,1
SOOKIE,"I am, I buy his wares. His livelihood depends on my.",1
LORELAI,Sookie!,1
SOOKIE,Oh! I'm a sexual harasser,1
LORELAI,Well then you need some false eyelashes.,1
SOOKIE,"This isn't funny. I am now desperate, lonely and a criminal.",1
LORELAI,"Ok, stop talking.",1
SOOKIE,But -,1
LORELAI,No you have exhausted all your talking rights by being crazy. Sit down and listen.,1
LORELAI,,1
LANE,You're sure you don't mind?,1
RORY,What's mine is yours.,1
LANE,I owe you forever.,1
RORY,Good to know.,1
LANE,Which one do you think Todd would like better?,1
RORY,I don't know Todd.,1
LANE,I think the rhinestones.,1
RORY,Rhinestones it is. So what did you tell your mom?,1
LANE,I told her that I was going to spend the evening here with you guys.,1
RORY,What if she calls?,1
LANE,Well I mentioned that we might go and rent some videos or go out to eat which could explain any absence during her call.,1
RORY,Very thorough.,1
LANE,"With my mom, you can leave nothing to chance. Especially when there is a non-korean involved who as far as I know has no medical aspirations.",1
LORELAI,"Hey, sparkly clips.",1
RORY,Thank you.,1
LORELAI,"Ooh, I like the rhinestones.",1
RORY,And for a touch of glamour.,1
LANE,So what are you going to tell Lorelai?,1
RORY,I don't know.,1
LANE,She wouldn't tell my mom would she?,1
RORY,I don't know if she'd feel good lying to another mother. It's like this weird code thing with her.,1
LANE,So we don't tell her?,1
RORY,I'm not liking that option either.,1
LANE,"No. We'll tell her that we're meet ing Dean for a movie, and then we go to the movie and then somebody who just happens to be a friend of Dean's, just happens to be there, for the same movie and so we figure that it would be completely rude for us to not ask said person to come sit with us.",1
RORY,"I say to hell with governor, you run directly for president.",1
LANE,It's not that bad.,1
RORY,"Let's just not think about it, ok?",1
LANE,I really appreciate this.,1
RORY,I know.,1
LANE,How do I look?,1
RORY,You look too good for him.,1
LANE,Just what I was going for.,1
RORY,We're going,1
LORELAI,"Oh, where?",1
LANE,We're going to a movie with Dean.,1
LORELAI,"Nothing dirty, violent or French please",1
RORY,Are you going to be home late?,1
LORELAI,Well there's a bit of doubt as to whether or not we'll ever actually get out of the house at all tonight. Sookie please!,1
SOOKIE,"Ok! I'm here, I'm down",1
LORELAI,"Wow! Hey, where's your coat?",1
SOOKIE,It's upstairs.,1
LORELAI,Aren't you gonna need it?,1
SOOKIE,"Oh well, it got caught around the thing, and then when I twisted around to get loose, and then the choking started. I'm free now.",1
LORELAI,Ok. I'll get you something to wear.,1
SOOKIE,I would appreciate that.,1
RORY,Bye.,1
LANE,Bye,1
SOOKIE,Bye kittens,1
LORELAI,Bye girls.,1
LORELAI,Huh?,1
SOOKIE,Oh this is beautiful.,1
LORELAI,It goes with the theme of the evening.,1
SOOKIE,This is a really nice thing you're doing for me.,1
LORELAI,Anytime Sookie.,1
SOOKIE,Last looks,1
LORELAI,I'll get it.,1
LORELAI,"Hi,",1
JACKSON,"Hi Lorelai, sorry we're late.",1
LORELAI,Oh no problem. Just adds a little more primping time for the ladies.,1
SOOKIE,Hi Jackson,1
JACKSON,"Sookie, hi",1
SOOKIE,Hi.,1
JACKSON,Hi.,1
SOOKIE,Hi.,1
JACKSON,Hi.,1
SOOKIE,Hi.,1

JACKSON,"Oh sure. Oh, uh Lorelai, this is my cousin Rune, Rune this is Lorelai.",1
LORELAI,"Hi, it's very nice to meet you",1
RUNE,Can I talk to you a minute?,1
JACKSON,What's the matter?,1
RUNE,"I need a minute alone, please?",1
JACKSON,Excuse us.,1
JACKSON,What are you doing?,1
RUNE,That's Lorelai?,1
JACKSON,Yes.,1
RUNE,Did you see how tall she is?,1
JACKSON,"No, I haven't noticed actually.",1
RUNE,"How could you not notice, she's like a basketball player.",1
JACKSON,"Rune, she's a very nice lady!",1
RUNE,"You know I cannot go out with anyone that tall. I mean God! I can't believe you set me up with that. What, was the bearded lady busy tonight or something?",1
JACKSON,"It's just one night, a little dinner.",1
RUNE,When she came to the door it never crossed my mind that that was who I had to spend the evening with. I thought it was her East German maid or something.,1
JACKSON,"You're being ridiculous, she's not that tall!",1
RUNE,She's tall enough!,1
JACKSON,"Would you keep it down, she's gonna hear you!",1
RUNE,With those big ears I bet she can.,1
JACKSON,"Hey Rune, you come in to town completely unannounced, you eat all my food, you crash on my couch and I don't say a thing. The least you could do is go out for one night - make some conversation, be pleasant, who knows, maybe you'll enjoy it!",1
RUNE,But why can't we go out - just to the two of us.,1
JACKSON,"Rune, please.",1
RUNE,Ok.,1
JACKSON,"Thank you Ok, I think we should be going.",1

RUNE,What size shoe do you wear?,1
LORELAI,"Uh, size 9.",1
RUNE,9? Wow.,1
SOOKIE,I wonder if the mussels are fresh?,1
LORELAI,"Um, well, it does say  fresh mussels' on the menu.",1
SOOKIE,"Yes, but a lot of times they say  fresh' and they're not, they're frozen but they're just called  fresh' because they were fresh when they were frozen. Plus if they're not stored with the correct drainage they just sit around in their own excretions, with is kind of like sitting around in your own -",1
LORELAI,"Sookie, I beg of you, do not order the fresh mussels.",1
SOOKIE,But if they're fresh -,1
LORELAI,Even if they're fresh.,1
JACKSON,I wonder where they get their carrots from The carrot crop this year has been really mealy.,1
LORELAI,So...Rune...,1
RUNE,Yes?,1
LORELAI,What is that -  Rune' ?,1
RUNE,What do you mean?,1
LORELAI,"I mean, where did  Rune' come from?",1
RUNE,"I'm from out of town, I thought Jackson told you?",1
LORELAI,"He did tell me, I meant the name  Rune'. You just don't meet a lot of  Runes', right?",1
RUNE,It was my dad's name.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, where'd he get it?",1
RUNE,"I don't know, from his parents I guess.",1
LORELAI,"Ok, done with that topic Oh the waiter, thanks the Lord.",1
WAITERory,What can I get you this evening?,1
SOOKIE,"I'd like to ask about the mussels, are they fresh?",1

LORELAI,,1
DEAN,What are you doing?,1
RORY,Nothing.,1

RORY,I just want to make sure they're having fun.,1
DEAN,They're having fun.,1
RORY,How do you know?,1
DEAN,They're not in prison or in some sort of medieval t*rture chamber.,1
RORY,Well when you measure it that way -,1
LANE,"And the amazing thing is, all these girls are screaming and none of them are getting the joke. He's playing the character of a rock star. I mean Beck is a genius and all these stupid girls are screaming at him just because they're buying into the rock star image. I love Beck. I understand Beck. And the Foo Fighters - Gods. I mean, have you heard the acoustic version of  Everlong'? I can't even talk about it you know? Hey, you know who I've really gotten into lately? The velvet underground.

SOOKIE,"What was Rory, eight?",1
LORELAI,I believe she was.,1
SOOKIE,"Oh god, that mud pie fiasco haunted me for a year! I mean, hers looked just like mine. Of course I used you know, homemad e chocolate cookies, bittersweet ganache and she used well, mud. You know, but they did look damn similar. Oh.",1
LORELAI,"So, uh, Sookie's been experimenting with, um, different forms of baking ever since I've known her.",1
JACKSON,"Oh, well, that's very interesting.",1
SOOKIE,"Yeah. Hey Lorelai, rememb er when I decided to teach you how to make strawberry tarts and the entire kitchen was stained red and I had to repaint that one wall red just to make it look normal? Do you remember? Wasn't it?",1
LORELAI,"Mmm, it was. Sookie, let's go powder our noses.",1
RUNE,You'll need a lot of powder.,1
LORELAI,We'll be right back. Come on hon.,1
SOOKIE,"Oh, ok.",1

SOOKIE,I haven't have I?,1
LORELAI,No.,1
SOOKIE,"I know. I'm just - Oh, I'm so nervous.",1
LORELAI,You're nervous? You don't have some guy staring at you like he's Cher and you're the kid from  Mask'.,1
SOOKIE,I can - I can't think of anything to say.,1
LORELAI,To Jackson?,1
SOOKIE,"Yes, to Jackson.",1
LORELAI,"Yes, cause to me tonight there's been no  off' button.",1
SOOKIE,"I-I just - ugh! This place is too fancy, my hair is too tight and this dress is all wrong. And he looks really good doesn't he?",1
LORELAI,Yes he does.,1
SOOKIE,"I'm being crazy, I know I'm being crazy.",1
LORELAI,"No. You're just putting too much pressure on this whole evening. Look, in five seconds I can take your hair down, we can go some place more casual and personally I think you're wrong about the dress.",1
SOOKIE,Really?,1
LORELAI,"Yes. Come on. Let's got to Luke's. You know, have burgers, talk, relax - no pressure, no stress, unless I wind up stepping on Rune which might be fun.",1
SOOKIE,That would be great.,1
LORELAI,"Ok, come on.",1
SOOKIE,,1
LANE,"Ok, what about movies, you must have a favorite movie.",1

LUKE,Who's the other guy?,1
LORELAI,That's Jackson's cousin. He's my date!,1
LUKE,Lucky girl!,1
LORELAI,"Yes, I think so. He is, believe it or not, even less thrilled with the match up than I am.",1
LUKE,"You're kidding, why?",1
LORELAI,I'm too tall.,1
LUKE,Get out.,1
LORELAI,I'm serious.,1
LUKE,Doesn't he understand how great that is? You can get all the stuff from the top shelf.,1

RUNE,"I don't wanna order, I don't wanna eat here. I wanna go.",1
JACKSON,Rune.,1
RUNE,"Jackson...Look I came out with you tonight under the impression that I'd have fun. First I get stuck with her, then I get dragged to a French restaurant, then I get dragged out of a French restaurant. God knows where I am now.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, you're at Luke's.",1
RUNE,"I've been very patient Jackson. Sunday night's almost over, I wanna go bowling.",1

RUNE,"Fine, I'll just see you at home then - maybe",1
LORELAI,Bye Loon! Finally.,1
LUKE,I guess you'll only need three menus now.,1
LORELAI,"Hey, why don't you make up three fabulous cheeseburgers and send two over there. I'll have mine here.",1

LORELAI,I'm not eating alone. You're here.,1

KIM,I have to know where girls are.,1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,With who?,1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,A boy? You let them go with a boy?,1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,Just because you let your daughter run around with boys doesn't mean I let mine.,1

RORY,I shouldn't have done it. I know I shouldn't have done it.,1
LORELAI,Damn right you shouldn't have done it.,1
RORY,"But Lane really wanted to go out with Todd, and of course she could tell her mother so I didn't tell you so you wouldn't have to lie for us.",1

LORELAI,I can't lie to another mother. That's breaking the code.,1
RORY,So then what were we supposed to do tonight?,1
LORELAI,"Look, I know that Mrs. Kim and Robert Duvall in  The Great Santini' share a striking resemblance, but she is Lane's mom. She has the right to tell Lane she can't do something, you have to respect that and I really have to respect that.",1
RORY,So we were in a no-win situation tonight.,1
LORELAI,Yep.,1
RORY,Great.,1

LANE,"I'm ok, I guess.",1
RORY,I was afraid to call.,1

RORY,I'm really sorry Lane.,1
LANE,It's not your fault.,1
RORY,I shouldn't have arranged it. I should've -,1
LANE,You arranged it because I asked you to and I'm really glad you did.,1
RORY,You are?,1
LANE,"If you hadn't set me up with Todd, then I would still be in love with him.",1
RORY,Not the guy for you huh?,1
LANE,"Not the guy for anybody who can read, write, talk or function on a basic human level.",1
RORY,I'm sorry.,1
LANE,I was so bored that night I couldn't see straight. I've been on Korean meditation weekends that have had more laughs.,1
RORY,"He liked you though, Dean told me.",1
LANE,"I know, he called here.",1
RORY,You're kidding.,1
LANE,I pretended to be my mother and wouldn't allow me to speak to him. Is that mean?,1
RORY,I think he'll survive. He and Dean went muffler shopping today.,1
LANE,That's nice.,1
RORY,So how long before you can get out?,1
LANE,I don't know. Right now I have to be in the house at all times except for school and church.,1

KIM,Fine.,1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,"Lane won't be coming over, she will stay in our house.",1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,Lane lied to me an d she must be punished.,1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,Lying is not showing respect.,1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,"Lane is not allowed to date boys unless we have approved them. She knows that, she knows our rules and she broke them. That is unacceptable.",1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,"I don't care what teenagers do, I care what Lane does.",1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,"I didn't throw away the key, it's in the kitchen.",1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,You blame your parents for getting pregnant.,1
LORELAI,,1
KIM,I don't want Lane to turn out like you either.,1

RORY,That's so great.,1
LORELAI,"I know it is. Of course if she tells me the story of how Jackson cultivates his own mealworms to help fertilize his plants one more time, I'm going to Romeo and Juliet them both.",1
RORY,It's sweet.,1
LORELAI,Mealworms.,1
RORY,"Gross, but sweet.",1
LORELAI,"Hey, you know the rules. No pages before french fries.",1

LORELAI,Safety tip - got it.,1
TAYLORory,"It's fine. I filed down the chip and if you place it strategically on the table, nobody will ever know.",1
LORELAI,"Uh, Taylor, would you like to write out some sort of instruction manual to go with the dishes?",1
TAYLORory,"Oh, could I?",1
LORELAI,Notepad's in the kitchen.,1
LORELAI,"Ooh, that's nice.",1
RORY,Put that back.,1
LORELAI,But it has rhinestones on it.,1
RORY,"The point of this is to get crap out of here, not to trade it in for new crap.",1
LORELAI,"Ok, are you seeing this?",1
RORY,Yes I am.,1
LORELAI,"No, I don't think you are, because if you were seeing this, you would see that this obviously has  Lorelai' written all over it.",1
RORY,"Fine, we'll just get rid of it at next year's sale.",1
LORELAI,Thank you.,1
SOOKIE,"Ok, you guys are gonna love me.",1

CALDECOTT,"As I mentioned yesterday, we will be holding a debate next week. Your subject  Did Charles I receive a fair trial' The pros will represent the parliament who deemed they had sovereignty and the cons will represent the monarch and try and prove that the charge against him was not legal. What is fascinating Mr. Dugray?",1
TRISTIN,"Uh, nothing Ms. Caldecott. MS.",1
CALDECOTT,Nothing Mr. Dugray?,1
TRISTIN,My notes - my notes are fascinating Ms. Caldecott. MS.,1
CALDECOTT,"Yes they are fascinating Mr. Dugray. As I was saying, the pro and con teams will each have two minutes and 30 seconds for introductions, six minutes to debate, three minutes for conclusions and five minutes for questions from the audience. The winner shall be decided by a hand count from the rest of the class. Does that sound like fun Mr. Dugray?",1
TRISTIN,What? MS.,1
CALDECOTT,The debate. Does it sound like fun?,1
TRISTIN,"Yes, it does. MS.",1
CALDECOTT,"It does, doesn't it Mr. Dugray?",1
TRISTIN,"Oh, it absolutely does Ms. Caldecott. MS.",1
CALDECOTT,More fun than staring at Miss Gilmore's ear?,1
TRISTIN,Yes Ms. Caldecott. MS.,1
CALDECOTT,"Yeah, I think so too. Ok, any questions? Good, I'll assign your teams. You, you, you, you - con. You, you, you, you, - pro. You, you, you, you - con. You, you, you -",1
PARIS,Who did she point to?,1
MADELINE,Well I think she...,1
PARIS,"Excuse me, Ms. Caldecott? MS.",1
CALDECOTT,Miss Geller?,1
PARIS,I wasn't sure who you pointed to just now. MS.,1
CALDECOTT,"Oh, uh, let's see. You, Miss Lynn, Miss Grant and Miss Gilmore.",1
PARIS,Are you sure? MS.,1
CALDECOTT,,1
RORY,So I guess we should make a plan.,1
MADELINE,To do what?,1
PARIS,To work out our debate Madeline.,1
MADELINE,"Oh, yeah right.",1
LOUISE,We need a place to work.,1
PARIS,My house is out.,1
LOUISE,Why?,1
PARIS,Because it is.,1
LOUISE,You need a reason.,1
PARIS,"My mother is having the entire place redone, she wants all evidence of my father out of there. So unless you want to sit on no furniture, while watching three Harvey Fierstein impersonators rip up the carpet and paint everything a ridiculous shade of white and call it  angel's kiss' then we're going to have to find somebody else's house to go to.",1
MADELINE,My brother has the measels.,1
LOUISE,My mom's having an affair.,1
RORY,"Well I guess we can go to my house. I mean, we're having a town rummage sale so it's kind of a mess, but it's there.",1
LOUISE,Isn't your house kind of far?,1
RORY,It's thirty minutes away by bus.,1
LOUISE,Bus? I don't do  bus'.,1
RORY,Well if you have a better suggestion -,1
PARIS,I'll drive.,1
RORY,"Ok, so then tomorrow.",1
MADELINE,Tomorrow.,1
LOUISE,Fine.,1
PARIS,Fine.,1
TRISTIN,Hey Paris.,1
PARIS,"Tristin, hi.",1
TRISTIN,You know I was really hoping we'd be in the same group.,1
PARIS,You were?,1
TRISTIN,"Oh yeah. I mean, it would make the long hours of studying go by a lot faster. Plus, come on - you and me on the same team, we'd wipe the floor with the others. I guess we'll just have to pair up on something else then huh?",1
PARIS,That would be good.,1
TRISTIN,"Yeah it would. I'll see you later. Bye Madeline, bye Louise.",1
LOUISE,Tristin suddenly has very big eyes for you grandma.,1
MADELINE,Lucky.,1
PARIS,"Stop it, he's just being nice.",1
MADELINE,He should be so nice to me.,1
LOUISE,And me.,1
PARIS,,1
RORY,Tomorrow.,1
LANE,Wow.,1
RORY,Yup.,1
LANE,All three of them huh?,1
RORY,"Double, double toil and trouble.",1
LANE,"Well, it should make for an interesting afternoon.",1
RORY,"With the pricking of my thumb, something wicked this way comes.",1
LANE,You're doing very well in the Shakespeare class aren't you?,1
RORY,Not bad.,1
LANE,Good.,1
RORY,Thanks. Ok so what's the plan?,1
LANE,We'll go in and ask her if I can go to a play tomorrow night with you and Lorelai.,1
RORY,A play?,1
LANE,I think that's the safest word. Show or concert would be very bad.,1
RORY,What about saying it's a movie?,1
LANE,Too far from the truth - almost a lie.,1
RORY,But a play is not a lie?,1
LANE,Well it's far away from the truth that it might work but close enough to the truth that I think I can negotiate a purgatory stint if forced to.,1
RORY,Play it is.,1
LANE,"Ok, we're going in.",1
MAN,,1
KIM,Yes - original.,1
MAN,,1
KIM,Joints are fine.,1

KIM,What's wrong?,1
LANE,,1
KIM,You look flushed.,1
LANE,,1
KIM,You eat candy?,1
LANE,,1
KIM,Doughnut?,1
LANE,,1
KIM,Hostess fruit-pie?,1
LANE,"No, nothing, I'm fine.",1
RORY,,1
KIM,Rory.,1
LANE,,1
KIM,I'm busy.,1
LANE,,1
KIM,Tomorrow is church.,1
LANE,,1
KIM,After church we think about what we heard in church.,1
LANE,,1
KIM,Show?,1
RORY,Play.,1
LANE,,1
KIM,Tell me ab out this play. What's it about?,1
LANE,,1
KIM,What?,1
LANE,I'm not sure what it's about.,1
RORY,,1
KIM,"You find out, then we talk.",1
MAN,,1
KIM,Yes I'm coming.,1
RORY,How's that purgatory negotiation looking?,1
LANE,Not good.,1
RORY,What do we do now?,1
LANE,I'll ask again later.,1
RORY,Well call me if you need anything.,1
LANE,,1
LUKE,"If you want coffee, you'll have to wait.",1
RORY,"Hey Luke, someone put a sign for the rummage sale up in your window over there.",1
LUKE,You can have decaf right now if you're in a hurry.,1
RORY,You should call the cops about this. I mean we all know how you feel about public displays of town affection.,1
LUKE,Your mom asked me to put it there ok?,1
RORY,And you said yes?,1
LUKE,She's not real good with  no'.,1
RORY,No she's not.,1
LUKE,"For every second you laugh at me, that's one second longer you're waiting for coffee.",1
RORY,"Sorry, no laughing.",1
LORELAI,Margaret Atworthy just dropped off three boxes of city council pot holders and begged me to take her grandson. People are getting crazy man. What?,1
RORY,What are you wearing?,1
LORELAI,"Hey, we have already argued about the sweatshirt.",1
RORY,Yes but we have not argued about the hat.,1
LORELAI,What hat?,1
RORY,"The one on your head, Annie Oakley.",1
LORELAI,It's great isn't it?,1
RORY,"As nice as it is that you're single handedly trying to rebuild the bridge, you have got to stop buying up other people's junk.",1
LORELAI,"The money goes to charity. I look cute. Case closed. Oh finally, the coffee cavalry arrives.",1
LUKE,What the hell do you think you're wearing?,1
LORELAI,A hat.,1
LUKE,Take that off.,1
LORELAI,What?,1
LUKE,"Now that is not yours, take it off.",1
LORELAI,But I'll have hat hair.,1
LUKE,I'm talking about the sweatshirt.,1
LORELAI,Luke calm down.,1
LUKE,That is not yours.,1
LORELAI,"No, I found it in the bags of stuff for the sale.",1
LUKE,Oh so you just find something and then you take it is that it?,1
LORELAI,"No, I paid for it.",1
LUKE,Oh so that makes it alright.,1
LORELAI,It makes it legal. What is the matter with you?,1
LUKE,Nothing. Nothing is the matter.,1
LORELAI,Luke...,1
LUKE,,1
LORELAI,Ok just a question. Did anyone in town keep anything?,1
SOOKIE,Doesn't look like it.,1
LORELAI,I'm never being civic-minded again.,1
SOOKIE,"Honey, you're doing a good thing. Ow!",1
LORELAI,Sookie!,1
SOOKIE,I'm ok.,1
LORELAI,Wave an arm.,1
SOOKIE,Here.,1
LORELAI,I gotcha.,1
SOOKIE,"Hold on, something down here likes me.",1
LORELAI,Oh.,1
SOOKIE,"Yeah, I'm good. Hold on. Up, please.",1
RORY,Jeez this stuff is like tribbles.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, thank God - just in time. Grab a bag and move it to the side of the room and be very careful, this pile just tried to eat Sookie.",1
RORY,Maybe I should sic it on Paris when she gets here.,1
LORELAI,"Oh my God, that's right. You're studying here today.",1
RORY,Any minute actually.,1
LORELAI,Oh this place is such a pit.,1
RORY,"Mom don't worry about it. They'll come in, they'll make a face, they'll say something snotty, we'll study, they'll leave. I'm just looking forward to this whole day being over, then I can concentrate on the concert.",1
LORELAI,,1
PATTY,"Lorelai, sweetheart would you come outside please? I want to know where you want me to put these.",1
LORELAI,Coming Patty!,1
SOOKIE,"Ok, two very large porcelain squirrels.",1
LORELAI,Set them free.,1
SOOKIE,Will do.,1
LORELAI,,1
PATTY,I danced on these drums at the Copacabana in 1969.,1
LORELAI,,1
PATTY,"Yeah, it was a great act. I wore bananas.",1
LORELAI,,1
PATTY,A lot of memo ries happened on these drums. But I guess it's time to move on.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, sure. Now you'll finally have room for the enormous tuba you've hand your eyes on. Just leave - leave these here.",1
RORY,"Yeah, you too. Bye. That was Lane",1
LORELAI,Oh and what's the verdict?,1
RORY,She decided to be stupid and tell her mother the truth - that she wanted to go to a rock concert with us tonight in New York.,1
LORELAI,Stupid.,1
RORY,Stupid.,1
LORELAI,I'm so sorry.,1
RORY,,1
PATTY,Well this looks really familiar.,1
LORELAI,,1
PATTY,Really? Who brought it in?,1
LORELAI,,1
PATTY,"Oh my, I wonder if -",1
LORELAI,,1
PATTY,I bet this was Rachel's.,1
SOOKIE,Oh my God - Rachel's?,1
LORELAI,Rachel? Who's Rachel?,1
SOOKIE,Rachel was Luke's very serious girlfriend. It does look like her.,1
LORELAI,,1
PATTY,"Oh this must have been what, five, six years ago? Did she break that man's heart. It was terrible.",1
LORELAI,How did I not know about this?,1
SOOKIE,,1
PATTY,Archeologist.,1
SOOKIE,,1
PATTY,Or a flight attendant.,1
LORELAI,,1
PATTY,At least I think so.,1
SOOKIE,Well Luke never talks about it. No one else likes to talk about it because he could probably k*ll you with that coffee pot if he wanted to.,1
LORELAI,,1
PATTY,Well I would keep this hidden if I were you. Well I gotta be going. Trampoline class at two.,1
SOOKIE,,1
PATTY,Bye.,1
LORELAI,"Bye, thanks for the drums.",1
SOOKIE,"Ok, these all need to be mended.",1
LORELAI,My room.,1

RORY,Let's just get this over with.,1
LORELAI,Take heart my dear. Suffer today party tonight.,1
LORELAI,Hi.,1
LOUISE,Hi.,1
MADELINE,Hi.,1
LORELAI,Come one in.,1
RORY,So did you guys find it ok?,1
PARIS,There's no sign on this street.,1
RORY,"I know, that's why I told you to turn right at the big rooster statue.",1
PARIS,I thought you were kidding.,1
LORELAI,"Oh no, we never kid about Monty.",1
LOUISE,Monty?,1
LORELAI,Monty the rooster - Monty.,1
LOUISE,Oh.,1
RORY,Everybody this is my mom.,1
LORELAI,Lorelai.,1
RORY,"This is Louise, Madeline and Paris.",1
LORELAI,"Ah, very good girl-group names. Ok, so, um sorry about the house of horrors here. Some crazy lady volunteered to lead this charity thing and we're trying to get her some help, so make yourselves comfortable. Rory, just yell when you guys want pizza.",1
RORY,Ok.,1
LORELAI,Ok.,1
RORY,So do you guys want to work in here or in the kitchen?,1
PARIS,Whatever.,1
RORY,Ok.,1
PARIS,"Ok, so here's how it should go. Madeline will do the introductions, I'll handle the debate, Rory will do the onclusion and Louise will take questions.",1
RORY,Why do you automatically get to handle the debate?,1
PARIS,Because I'm the most experienced at it.,1
MADELINE,"Trust me, you want her to handle the debate. She never gives up.",1
LOUISE,Le pitbull.,1
RORY,Ok.,1
LOUISE,So what is all this stuff?,1
RORY,"Uh, it's for a big town rummag e sale.",1
MADELINE,Like a charity thing?,1
RORY,Yeah. There's this old bridge that's completely falling apart and the town's trying to save it.,1
LOUISE,Oh cool hat.,1
PARIS,Put that down. It's used.,1
LOUISE,Vintage dear.,1
PARIS,Filthy darling.,1
MADELINE,There's this great store under my therapist office who has the best vintage clothes. I found an original Pucci top for practically nothing.,1
LOUISE,Oh Pucci is very big right now.,1
MADELINE,Is this a Pucci?,1
RORY,"No, that's a patty.",1
LOUISE,A patty?,1
RORY,Miss Patty. She's a dance teacher here. These are some of her old costumes.,1
LOUISE,Oh here Paris. Tristin might like this,1
PARIS,Can we just work please?,1
LOUISE,Ugh. I would love to have a boyfriend that looked like Tristin.,1
MADELINE,Your boyfriend's no slouch either.,1
RORY,No he's not.,1
LOUISE,Oh yes - 6'2... and fiesty. So how's that going? Are you two still  Joanie loves Chachi'?,1
RORY,"God, I hope not.",1
MADELINE,You are still together aren't you?,1
RORY,"Yeah, we're still together.",1
LOUISE,How long has it been?,1
RORY,I don't know.,1
MADELINE,You do too.,1
RORY,About a month.,1
LOUISE,"Oh, lifers.",1
PARIS,Hey!,1
MADELINE,Jeez.,1
PARIS,We have a debate to organize here and this conversation is quickly veering towards the subject of french kissing and glitter eye shadow - trashy or trendy? And I for one have no intention of being humiliated in front of the whole class because we were forced to study in the middle of a carnival and you two couldn't keep your eye on the prize! I want to win and I'm going to win.,1
LOUISE,So how good of a kisser is Paul Bunyan anyway?,1
SOOKIE,"Ok, does anyone in town have a peg leg?",1
LORELAI,Uh...no.,1
SOOKIE,Hem these.,1
LORELAI,So tell me mo re about this Rachel?,1
SOOKIE,Why are you so curious?,1
LORELAI,Well because apparently everybody in town knows everything about it and I don't like to be out of the loop.,1
SOOKIE,It's old news.,1
LORELAI,"Yes but I'm fascinated. I mean, I go to Luke's once a day, sometimes twice - three times if Michel has talked to one of his relatives and his accent has gotten thicker. I feel I should know the whole story. What happened? Where'd she go?",1
SOOKIE,"Well, Rachel liked to move around a lot. She was very adventurous person. She loved to climb things and fling herself off of cliffs and dive into these really tiny lakes and ride big wild horses and fly planes.",1
LORELAI,So she was wonder woman.,1
SOOKIE,She was to Luke. I thought they were going to get married.,1
LORELAI,What happened?,1
SOOKIE,The rumour is that Starts Hollow was too small for her. She wanted to live somewhere more exciting.,1
LORELAI,But Luke didn't.,1
SOOKIE,Mm. You know Luke. He lived here all his life. He wouldn't even go away for college. I think we're going to bury him in that diner.,1
LORELAI,Wow. It's sad.,1
SOOKIE,"Yeah. Ok, well I am done here. I'm gonna stop by the inn for a while and then I am gonna go home an d I'm gonna change for the show tonight.",1
LORELAI,We leave at 6.,1
SOOKIE,"I will be here, bye",1
PARIS,We'll need the actual quotes so learn them by heart.,1
MADELINE,What about using note cards.,1
PARIS,Note cards look sloppy. We will know our information.,1
MADELINE,But the other teams will use note cards.,1
PARIS,And the other team will lose.,1
SOOKIE,"Bye girls, Rory, see you tonight!",1
RORY,Bye Sookie.,1
LORELAI,What's tonight?,1
RORY,We've got tickets to see the Bangles at the Pastorella theatre.,1
MADELINE,In New York?,1
RORY,Yeah.,1
LOUISE,Sounds potentially not boring.,1
RORY,It's gonna be great actually and the seats are amazing.,1
MADELINE,Who are you going with?,1
RORY,My mom and Sookie.,1
LOUISE,You're kidding?,1
RORY,What?,1
LOUISE,You're going to a concert with your mom?,1
RORY,Yeah.,1
MADELINE,I cannot imagine doing anything like that with my mom.,1
RORY,Actually we do stuff like this all the time.,1
MADELINE,Really?,1
RORY,Yeah.,1
MADELINE,Wow.,1
LOUISE,"Hey, how old is your mom anyways?",1
RORY,32.,1
MADELINE,Young.,1
LOUISE,So that means she had you when she was...,1
PARIS,"16. She had her when she was 16. We've done the math, can we just  ooh' and  aah' about this quickly and get back to work?",1
LOUISE,16. I'm 16.,1
MADELINE,So am I.,1
PARIS,We're all 16 ok. Everybody in this room is 16.,1
RORY,Paris is right. We should work.,1
PARIS,Thank you.,1
LOUISE,I can't imaging having a baby at 16.,1
PARIS,Well then keep your knees shut.,1
LOUISE,Very nice.,1
MADELINE,Do you think your mom is sorry she got pregnant so young?,1
PARIS,Of course she is.,1
RORY,Why thank you.,1
PARIS,I didn't meant that. I just meant that...,1
RORY,"I mean, I don't think she would recommend it but I think she's happy with how things turned out.",1
LORELAI,I am?,1
RORY,Yes you are.,1
LORELAI,"Ok, just checking. Hey, I'm starving, is it pizza time yet?",1
RORY,Are you guys hungry?,1
MADELINE,I am.,1
PARIS,I can't eat dairy.,1
LORELAI,"Ok, one with cheese, one without. Cokes?",1
RORY,Yes please.,1
MADELINE,Me too.,1
PARIS,We're never going to finish.,1
LOUISE,I find your mother completely fascinating.,1
RORY,Funny - so does she.,1
LOUISE,It's almost more like having a big sister.,1
MADELINE,And you like her don't you?,1
RORY,She's my best friend.,1
LOUISE,"Truly, completely fascinating.",1
LORELAI,Rory come in here a sec!,1
RORY,I'll be right back.,1
LORELAI,"Hey, how's it going in there?",1
RORY,"Truly, completely fascinating.",1
LORELAI,Really?,1
RORY,"Well we've basically gotten no work down at all. Paris is having a meltdown, which by the way is always fun.",1
LORELAI,Sounds it.,1
RORY,"And, I don't know, we've just been talking.",1
LORELAI,"Well, I think you're actually making some friends here.",1
RORY,"Let's not get ahead of ourselves. They've basically just moved off the plan to dump the pig's blood on me at the prom, that's all.",1
LORELAI,"Talking, chatting, no work being done - there's friend potential going on.",1
RORY,Maybe - with Louise and Madeline at least.,1
LORELAI,Two out or three formerly psychotic enemies - not bad. There - pop- tart appetizers to tide you over till the pizza comes.,1
RORY,Thanks,1
LORELAI,"Hey, I have kind of a crazy idea.",1
RORY,Those are never comforting words coming from you.,1
LORELAI,Just consider this ok?,1
RORY,Ok.,1
LORELAI,"Now, we have four tickets to the show tonight.",1
RORY,Yes we do.,1
LORELAI,What if I give them to you? You take them.,1
RORY,What are you talking about?,1
LORELAI,"Well, it just seems like you guys have kind of a bonding thing going on in there, it might be fun.",1
RORY,But what about you?,1
LORELAI,"No, no you and I have already bonded. In fact, if we bond any further, we will be permanently fused together.",1
RORY,You've been talking about this concert since you heard about it.,1
LORELAI,I can still go.,1
RORY,How?,1
LORELAI,Sookie and I can buy cheap seats when we get there.,1
RORY,These tickets are 9th row aisle - dream seats.,1
LORELAI,"Look, you don't have to do this, but I just think you have three years of Chilton ahead of you and it might be nice to have some friendly type people to talk to there. And I don't know, you guys seem to be getting along, it might be good. And I totally don't mind, I just want to see the show, I don't care from what seat.",1
RORY,Are you sure?,1
LORELAI,Completely sure.,1
RORY,Because I -,1
LORELAI,Oh ladies! Hey what are you guys doing tonight?,1
MADELINE,Why?,1
LORELAI,Well we have these really great tickets to see the Bangles at the Pastorella theater and Rory thought you might like to come al ong.,1

RORY,Yeah - I mean if you guys want to.,1
MADELINE,I would love to go.,1
LOUISE,Count me in .,1
RORY,"Paris, what about you?",1
PARIS,I can't.,1
LOUISE,Yes you can.,1
PARIS,"No, I can't.",1
LOUISE,Because you're busy doing what?,1
PARIS,I have homework.,1
MADELINE,She'll be there.,1
RORY,Good.,1
LORELAI,,1
RORY,He made it,1
MADELINE,Oh he's handy. How great.,1
LOUISE,And you wear it all the time right?,1
LORELAI,Just when she's breathing.,1
SOOKIE,It's a love thing.,1
RORY,Thanks for the contributions.,1
LORELAI,"Ok here Ah! With these tickets you are about to enter sacred space, you will be treading on hallowed ground, you will be walking like and Egyptian.",1
RORY,Mom.,1
LORELAI,Take'em. Oh you're going to have a great time. The Bangles are the best! They were my favorite band in high school. I almost named you Susanna. The day I found out you had no musical talent at all was the saddest day of my life.,1
RORY,I'm sorry.,1
LORELAI,"Well you say that now. Here, ok, these are probably located - Hi!",1
USHERory,Hi.,1
LORELAI,Can you tell me w here these seats are?,1
USHERory,"Uh, those are right in here.",1

SOOKIE,And you're jealous.,1
LORELAI,What?,1

LORELAI,You're accusing me of being jealous of a woman who dumped a man I'm not even interested in five years ago?,1
SOOKIE,Yes.,1
LORELAI,And you don't think that's crazy?,1
SOOKIE,Oh I do think that's crazy?,1

PARIS,So what do we do now?,1

PARIS,Ok.,1
RORY,I can't believe Louise and Madeline would just leave like that.,1
PARIS,They've done it before.,1
RORY,Nice.,1
PARIS,"Yeah, well.",1
RORY,Can I ask you a question?,1
PARIS,Maybe.,1
RORY,What could you possibly see in Tristin?,1
PARIS,You wouldn't understand.,1
RORY,Is it just that he's cute?,1
PARIS,Partly.,1
RORY,Cause there are a lot of cute guys in the world.,1
PARIS,Not like Tristin.,1
RORY,He's just such a jerk.,1
PARIS,He's not always a jerk.,1
RORY,No?,1
PARIS,No.,1
RORY,Ok. When is not a jerk?,1
PARIS,I've known Tristin a really long time ok? We've been in the same class since kindergarten.,1
RORY,Really?,1
PARIS,Yes...and he has things in his life that are hard. His parents - not so great. We have that in common.,1
RORY,Ok.,1
PARIS,He kissed me once.,1
RORY,He did?,1
PARIS,In the 6th grade - on a dare.,1
RORY,How romantic.,1
PARIS,You just don't know him like I do ok?,1
RORY,"Ok, I believe you. I just - I think maybe you could do better.",1
PARIS,"I know he's flirting with me to get to you, but at least he's flirting with me.",1
LORELAI,Hey.,1
RORY,There you are.,1
LORELAI,"Think fast T-shirts for all the girls because I'm the good witch of the - hey, aren't you missing a couple of kids?",1
RORY,They left.,1
LORELAI,Excuse me?,1
RORY,Madeline and Louise met these guys and they -,1

RORY,"I don't know, they were sitting behind us and they were having a party.",1
LORELAI,Unbelievable!,1
SOOKIE,What's going on?,1
LORELAI,They left.,1
SOOKIE,What?,1
LORELAI,,1
LORELAI,"I leave the house with four girls, I'm coming home with four girls. Hi, I'm looking for a couple of college boys, who might live here or have friends who live here.",1
WOMAN,I don't talk to anyone. People annoy me.,1
LORELAI,What?,1
SOOKIE,She found him with the blonde again.,1
PARIS,She's gonna knock on every door in the entire building isn't she?,1
RORY,Yep.,1
PARIS,Wow.,1
LORELAI,Hello? Is anyone home?,1
SOOKIE,Hello? Aah! Let's go follow your mother.,1
PARIS,I wonder if I was missing if my mom would come looking for me like that.,1
RORY,"Paris, you know she would.",1
PARIS,"Yeah, or at least she'd send somebody.",1
SOOKIE,Music.,1
LORELAI,Let's go.,1
RORY,"Mom, that's one of the guys.",1
GUY,Yeah?,1
LORELAI,"Thanks. Hi, could you move please?",1
GUY,What?,1
LORELAI,"Hey, did you miss me?",1
LOUISE,Lorelai.,1
LORELAI,"Ms. Gilmore. Put the cups down, let's move.",1
GUY,Is there a problem?,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, see those two idiots over there? They're 16 - underage and I bet you're not. I also bet those big fancy party cups aren't holding lemonade. You really want to end any further conversations with me so step aside Skippy. Move your asses outside - now! Hey. I am not even going to begin to tell you how completely insane it is to take off with anyone you don't know, or drink things that you don't know what's in them, or act like you have a clue when you don't, but so help me G od if you ever pull a stunt like this again, it will not be around my kid! Do you understand me?",1
LOUISE,Yes.,1
MADELINE,Yes.,1
LORELAI,"Good, now let's go. I can't wait to meet your parents. We have some catching up to do. I think we'll just talk and talk and talk all night long.",1
PARIS,,1
LANE,I cannot believe I missed it.,1
RORY,The concert was amazing.,1
LANE,Forget about the concert. I wanted to see Lorelai pull those idiots out of that guy's apartment.,1
RORY,It definitely was a Kodak moment.,1
LORELAI,Hey.,1
RORY,Hey.,1
LORELAI,"Hey, you didn't wake me up.",1
RORY,I set the clock.,1
LORELAI,"Yes, but see the clock stops ringing once I throw it against the wall giving me ample time to fall back to sleep, you however never stop yapping no matter how hard I throw you, thus ensuring the wake up process.",1
LANE,"I'm gonna get a soda, anybody want anything?",1
RORY,Gum.,1
LORELAI,"Yes, the night of my 14th birthday back so I can right the green-hot-pant-roller-disco outfit wrong.",1
LANE,Coming right up.,1
LORELAI,"Bye. So, talked to anybody today?",1
RORY,You mean Madeline or Louise or Paris?,1
LORELAI,Yes.,1
RORY,No.,1
LORELAI,Right.,1
RORY,Though I bet school tomorrow will be really interesting.,1
LORELAI,"Oh yes - stories of Rory's Bangle's - obsessed mother ripping open apartment doors, scaring the pointy haired boys.",1
RORY,"Totally uncool, man.",1
LORELAI,"I had to do it Rory, they could've gotten hurt.",1
RORY,I know.,1
LORELAI,"God, I thought inviting those girls out would make things easier for you at school.",1
RORY,"Yeah, well I've always thought  easy' is completely overrated.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, that's my twisted girl.",1
RORY,Plus Paris decided to let me split the debate time with her.,1
LORELAI,"Wow! Wait, why am I wowing?",1
RORY,Because splitting debate time w ith Paris is like doing that whole  spitting in your palm and shaking hands' friendship oath thing.,1
LORELAI,But way less gross?,1
RORY,Yeah.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, good, I'm glad then. Oh, uh, I'll be right back.",1
RORY,Ok.,1
LORELAI,Hey.,1
LUKE,"Oh, hey.",1
LORELAI,Find anything good?,1
LUKE,"Oh yeah, I got some refrigerator magnets shaped like sushi for a nickel, so basically I scored.",1
LORELAI,Oh good.,1
LUKE,"Hey, look, about that thing that happened the other day -",1
LORELAI,Oh forget it.,1
LUKE,"I was a jerk, I didn't mean it.",1
LORELAI,I know - really,1
LUKE,"Yeah well, I am sorry.",1
LORELAI,I wanted to give this back to you,1
LUKE,"Oh no, you bought it.",1
LORELAI,I know but it's yours and I didn't know.,1
LUKE,You didn't know?,1
LORELAI,About the former owner.,1
LUKE,Oh.,1
LORELAI,"If I had, I wouldn't have flaunted it in front of you like that.",1
LUKE,"Hey, it's not a big deal, I was having a bad day, that's it. Now I got magnetic sushi and all is right with the world.",1
LORELAI,Ok good. So here. It obvious ly means something to you.,1
LUKE,But you have to let things go eventually right?,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, but sometimes you need a little something to remind you. I mean you wouldn't want to forget everything would you?",1
LUKE,No there was some stuff that I definitely would not want to forget.,1
LORELAI,"Well here, so you don't forget.",1
LUKE,"Thanks, can I pay you for it?",1
LORELAI,"In coffee, absolutely.",1
LUKE,Alright. I'm not pining you know -,1
LORELAI,I know,1
LUKE,Just rememb ering.,1
LORELAI,Got it.,1
LUKE,Rememb ering is not pining.,1
LORELAI,You're absolutely right.,1
LUKE,,1
LORELAI,I can see the resemblance.,1
LUKE,"Ok, well good.",1
LORELAI,Bye Luke.,1

DEAN,Hello?,1
LORELAI,Do you come bearing pizza?,1
DEAN,I'm not an idiot.,1
LORELAI,Then get in here.,1
RORY,Hey.,1
DEAN,Hey.,1
LORELAI,Sit -- you're missing it.,1
DEAN,What are we watching?,1
LORELAI,"The incomparable ""Donna Reed Show.""",1
RORY,What's in there?,1
DEAN,A salad.,1
RORY,Salad?,1
DEAN,"Yeah, it's a quaint dish sometimes used to precede large quantities of pizza.",1
DEAN,It's for me.,1
RORY,Clearly.,1
DEAN,"So, who's Donna Reed.",1
RORY,What?,1
LORELAI,You don't know who Donna Reed is? The quintissential 50s mom with the perfect 50s family?,1
Posted,03/06/01 08:15,1
RORY,"Never without a smile and high heels? Hair, that if you hit it with a hammer , would crack?",1
DEAN,So it's a show?,1
RORY,It's a lifestyle.,1
LORELAI,It's a religion.,1
RORY,My favorite episode --,1
LORELAI,"Mm, mm...tell me, tell me.",1
RORY,"-- is when their son, Jeff, comes home from school and nothing happens.",1
LORELAI,"Oh that's a good one. One of my favorites is when Mary, the daughter, gets a part-time job and nothing happens.",1
RORY,Another classic.,1
DEAN,So what's this one about?,1
LORELAI,"This one is actually quite filled with intrigue. The husband, Alex, comes home late for dinner and he didn't call.",1
RORY,Might as well kick the dog too.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, oh, look, she's making doughnuts. DONNA",1
REED,...behind in the sugar department.,1
JEFF,"I guess I was thinking of something else, Mom.",1
LORELAI,"""Not that my sugary attitude wouldn't make anyone an instant diabetic.""",1
RORY,Mother-daughter window washing. We should try that.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, right after mother-daughter shock treatments. ""You know, Daughter, there's nothing more satisfying thatn washing windows -- oh no!""",1
RORY,"""What? Did I miss a spot?""",1
LORELAI,"""No, I just had an impure thought about your father, Alex. Funny -- I don't know why I had it. It isn't the second Saturday of the month.""",1
RORY,"""Hey, I heard you had an impure thought.""",1
LORELAI,"""I must now sublimate all my impure thoughts by going into the kitchen and making an endless string of perfect casseroles.""",1
DEAN,You're not even listening to the dialogue.,1
RORY,Ours is better.,1
DEAN,I don't know -- it all seems kind of nice to me.,1
RORY,What does?,1
DEAN,"Well, you know, families hanging together. I mean, a wife cooking dinner for her husband. And look -- she seems really happy.",1
LORELAI,She's medicated.,1
RORY,And acting from a script.,1
LORELAI,Written by a man.,1
RORY,"Well said, Sister Suffragette.",1
DEAN,What if she likes making doughnuts and dinner for her family and keeping things nice for them and --,1
DEAN,"OK, I feel very unpopular right now. DONNA",1
REED,"You, know, dear, the first ten years we were married, I was upset when you came home late for dinner.",1
ALEX,And you're not anymore? DONNA,1
REED,Nope. You are no longer late for dinner. You're just extremely early for breakfast.,1
DEAN,"Hey, I'm not saying a word.",1
RORY,Can brains hurt?,1
LORELAI,"Yes, it's hypochondria hour.",1
RORY,"No, I'm serious. Last night when I was reading my biology chapters I distinctly heard a ping in the vicinity of my brain.",1
LORELAI,Your brain pinged?,1
RORY,"Yeah. It just went like ""dink.""",1
LORELAI,"Well then, honey, your brain dinked. It didn't ping.",1
RORY,Well I don't think a dinking brain is any less worrisome than a pinging brain.,1
LORELAI,"Well, you got me there.",1
RORY,So should I go to a tumor doctor?,1
LORELAI,"No, you don't have a tumor. You're reading too much. You're probably just losing your eyesight.",1
RORY,Thank you.,1
LORELAI,You're welcome.,1
LORELAI,"Hi, can you take a little constructive criticism?",1
LUKE,No.,1
LORELAI,OK. This place could use a makeover.,1
LUKE,Hmm.,1
LORELAI,Yeah. It just needs a sprucing up. Like a coat of paint.,1
LUKE,I don't spruce.,1
LORELAI,What do you mean you don't spruce?,1
TAYLORory,"What he means is he won't spruce, that's what he means.",1
LUKE,"Taylor, do not start.",1
TAYLORory,"Me and the rest of the town beautification commit tee have been hounding him for years to freshen up the place -- maybe a couple of nice zinnia pots out front, some yellow awnings, a peppy little cardboard pig announcing the specials -- but he's a mule. He won't talk, he won't reason, he won't spruce. You might as well forget it, Lorelai. I'm forgetting it too.",1
LUKE,Finally a Taylor Doose position I can get behind.,1
TAYLORory,Faded paint is a bad reflection on the whole town.,1
LUKE,Whatever happened to giving up?,1
TAYLORory,"When standards slip, families flee and in comes the seedy crowd. You got trouble, my friends.",1
LORELAI,Right here in River City!,1
TAYLORory,"This is not funny, Lorelai.",1
LUKE,Does anyone want anything?,1
LORELAI,"Uh, yes, I do. I want to know why you won't paint this place.",1
LUKE,Painting's a pain. I'd have to close the place for a day -- which I can't afford -- or paint it in the middle of the night -- which I don't want to do because I hate painting.,1
LORELAI,"OK, how about this? I'll help you. I love to paint.",1
LUKE,You do?,1
LORELAI,"Yes, I do.",1
LUKE,You love it?,1
LORELAI,I want to marry it.,1
LUKE,You have strange passions.,1
RORY,She likes washing dishes too. She's mult-faceted abnormal.,1
LORELAI,"Ah, come on. We'll drink a couple beers, we'll sing painting songs.",1
LUKE,Painting songs.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, painting songs. Like, uh, you know, the song that goes, um... ""Grab your brush and grab your rollers/All you kids and all you...bowlers/We're going paintin' today!"" Say yes or there's another verse.",1
LUKE,Well I guess maybe...if I had help.,1
TAYLORory,Really? Oh my God! That's wonderful! Hurrah!,1
LUKE,"Taylor, it's not for you. It's for me.",1
TAYLORory,I can't wait to tell the rest of the committee. They're not going to believe this.,1
LUKE,I hate that he's pleased.,1
LORELAI,"Ah, you'll drop a gum wrapper on the street in front of his store later.",1
LUKE,"Yeah, good idea. LORELAI Mmm. Kick-ass wine.",1
EMILY,How poetic.,1
LORELAI,It's got a nice,1
smell,"earthy, vibrant. I can taste the Italians' feet.",1
RICHARD,It's a Bordeaux. It's French.,1
LORELAI,Ah. What's an Italian foot doing in a French wine?,1
RORY,So when do you guys leave for Martha's Vineyard?,1
RICHARD,"Ah, we're not going to Martha's Vineyard this year.",1
RORY,Really? Why not?,1
RICHARD,Our usual rental wasn't available when we inquired -- late.,1
EMILY,We should have just bought a place years ago like I wanted.,1
RICHARD,It wouldn't have been prudent.,1
EMILY,Now we have no place to go next week.,1
RORY,"Well you could always go somewhere else, couldn't you?",1
RICHARD,We always go to the Vineyard at this time of year.,1
LORELAI,"Well, you know, you could break the chain, Dad. Go to Paris.",1
RORY,"Yes, Paris!",1
LORELAI,"Impressionism, poodles.",1
RORY,Creme broule.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, that's great!",1
RICHARD,Impossible!,1
LORELAI,Porquoi? French.,1
EMILY,We only go to Europe in the fall.,1
LORELAI,"You know, Mom, I heard a rumor Europe's still there in the spring.",1
RORY,I heard that too.,1
EMILY,We know that it's there in the spring but we never go in the spring because we always go in the fall.,1
LORELAI,It's getting a little too Lewis Carroll for me.,1
RICHARD,Well what is so interesting about Europe in the spring?,1
LORELAI,Spring vegetables.,1
EMILY,You want us to go to Europe to eat a vegetable?,1
LORELAI,"No, Mom. I don't know. There's all kinds of stuff. There's festivals and, you know, Europe.",1
EMILY,In the fall.,1
RICHARD,It costs a fortune to travel first class in Europe. We only do it every two years.,1
EMILY,In the fall.,1
RICHARD,It's just not in the budget this year.,1
LORELAI,You don't have to fly first class.,1
LORELAI,'Cause there's always coach.,1
LORELAI,Or business class is slightly less. There's deals on the internet. Hmm. Pass the potatoes.,1
RORY,You got it.,1
RORY,Catherine the Great - 1729 to '96. Empress of Russia - 1762 to '96.,1
LORELAI,"OK, hold still please.",1
RORY,Originally named Sophie Friedricke Augustine von Anhalt-Zerbst.,1
LORELAI,"But everybody called her ""Kitten.""",1
RORY,Married to Grand Duke Peter of Holstein in 1754.,1
LORELAI,"OK, Rory, seriously.",1
RORY,The marriage was an unhappy one.,1
LORELAI,Well there were way too many names.,1
LORELAI,Ow! Lady with notecards just look at lady with needle and just try to focus for one second so that I can sew the button on your sweater and not on my thumb.,1
RORY,I'm sorry.,1
RORY,I'll get it!,1
LORELAI,"Oh, you're four years old.",1
BABETTE,"Oh, hiya, baby doll.",1
RORY,"Hi, Babette.",1
LORELAI,Hey! Do you want some coffee?,1
BABETTE,"Oh, no thanks. I just came over to ask a great big favor.",1
LORELAI,Ask away.,1
BABETTE,"Well, see, Morey just got a call to play a gig at the Village Vanguard tonight so we got to go to New York.",1
LORELAI,Oh wow! Cream?,1
BABETTE,"And sugar. Thanks. Anyway, yesterday Morey and I finally broke down and we got ourselves a new little baby, you know?",1
LORELAI,"Oh, honey, you got a kitten! Good for you.",1
RORY,What's its name?,1
BABETTE,Apricot. He's just the cutest thing. But he's so teeny. There's no way he can go with us and I would hate for him to stay all alone in the house so I was thinking maybe Rory could come over and house-sit for the evening.,1
RORY,I'd love to.,1
BABETTE,Oh great! We've got a kitchen full of food and Morey just got cable so you can watch those four girls talking dirty if you want to.,1
RORY,Sounds good.,1
BABETTE,"You're an angel. Both of you -- angels. You have a key, right?",1
LORELAI,We got it covered.,1
BABETTE,Oh great. All right. I'll leave ya the number where we're staying. Have a good time. We'll be back tomorrow morning. I love you crazy girls.,1
LORELAI,Bye!,1
BABETTE,Bye!,1
LORELAI,Wow. I can't believe how fast you jumped at the chance to spend a night away from me.,1
RORY,You're crazy. I'm doing her a favor.,1
LORELAI,"Mm-hm, mm-hm. Sure you are.",1
RORY,Mom!,1
LORELAI,"No, no, that's OK. Don't you worry about me. I'll be just fine.",1
RORY,I'd like to debate you on that last subject but I'm late for the bus.,1
LORELAI,"You know, this is only like the second night we've ever spent apart. Doesn't that make you sad?",1
RORY,"Yeah, but I'll get over it.",1
LORELAI,"Uh-huh. Well, Paul and Linda McCartney only spent eleven nights apart their entire relationship. Did you know that?",1
RORY,I did not know that.,1
LORELAI,Well they were truly devoted to each other. Just the being apart was too painful to even talk about.,1
RORY,I understand.,1
LORELAI,I don't think that Linda would have even considered cat-sitting without Paul.,1
RORY,"You know, Mom, when I go off to college, I'm gonna be gone every night. What will you dothen?",1
LORELAI,"Well, I will go with you. I will sleep on the floor in your dorm, next to your bed.",1
RORY,Well at least you've got a plan.,1
LORELAI,"Yes. Um, perhaps you'd like to take a picture of me with you tonight, you know, just in case you get lonely, you can talk to it.",1
RORY,Bye.,1
DEAN,"Carry your bird, Miss?",1
RORY,Hi! I didn't expect to see you here.,1
DEAN,Just wanted to say hello.,1
RORY,Hello.,1
DEAN,Hello.,1
RORY,Hello.,1
DEAN,So...who's your friend?,1
RORY,Homework.,1
DEAN,Really?,1
RORY,We will be cohabitating for the next month so I can examine its every move. Jealous?,1
DEAN,I'll get over it.,1
RORY,So -- hey -- I'm house-sitting tonight for Babette and I was thinking maybe if the right offer came al ong I might be up to some company.,1
DEAN,Well I'm offering.,1
RORY,I'm accepting.,1
DEAN,Good.,1
RORY,You want to get some coffee?,1
DEAN,I can't. I have to get to work.,1
RORY,I thought you go to work at five.,1
DEAN,"No, four on Thursdays. For some reason Thursday is always really busy. Lots of oppressed housewives shopping for their husbands' dinners.",1
RORY,Wow.,1
DEAN,What?,1
RORY,That was a little pointed.,1
DEAN,What are you talking about?,1
RORY,That crack about the housewives shopping for their husbands' dinners.,1
DEAN,Come on -- it was a joke.,1
RORY,"Yeah, well, it was a pretty weird joke to hear coming out of your mouth.",1
DEAN,You are so sensitive about the whole Donna Reed thing.,1
RORY,I'm not sensitive about it. I just find it ridiculous.,1
DEAN,Why?,1
RORY,What do you mean why?,1
DEAN,"Well, so she cooked a lot.",1
RORY,"A lot? She made homemad e doughnuts, chocolate cake, a lamp chop-mashed potato dinner, and enough stew to feed Cambodia all in one episode.",1
DEAN,So what?,1
RORY,"You really like that concept, don't you?",1
DEAN,"No, I -- well, yeah, sort of.",1
RORY,Oh my God.,1
DEAN,"I mean, it's a little over the top but the general idea of a wife cooking dinner for her husband and family, that's nice. Why is that not nice?",1
RORY,It's not just that. It's the having to have the dinner on the table as soon as the husband gets home an d having to look perfect to do housework and the whole concept that her one point in life is to serve somebody else.,1
DEAN,"Fine, yes, but maybe there are two points of view here.",1
RORY,I don't think so.,1
DEAN,Well you just feel that way becasue your mother feels that way.,1
RORY,Oh -- what -- so I have no opinions of my own?,1
DEAN,I didn't mean that.,1
RORY,Well if I have no opinions of my own then I guess I'd be just the kind of girl you like.,1
DEAN,"Rory, my mom used to make dinner for my dad every day before she started working. Andnow she even does it on the weekends. So what does that say about her?",1
RORY,It says that she has a choice and Donna Reed didn't.,1
DEAN,"You do realize that Donna Reed wasn't real, don't you?",1
RORY,"Yes, I know she wasn't real, but she represented millions of women that were real and did have to dress like that and act like that.",1
DEAN,Please tell me how we got into an argument about The Donna Reed Show.,1
RORY,I don't know.,1
DEAN,"OK, look, I got to go to work.",1
RORY,Dean.,1
DEAN,What?,1
RORY,Bird?,1
DEAN,Oh.,1
RORY,Hey.,1
LORELAI,"Hey, good. I was just about to leave.",1
RORY,Where are you going?,1
LORELAI,"To Luke's. We're picking out paint colors tonight so it's going to be hours of ""yes,"" ""no,"" ""yes,"" ""no,"" ""yes,"" ""no,"" until my world-famous perseverence wears him down and he winds up in a ball on the floor crying like a girl. Wanna come watch?",1
RORY,"I'm house-sitting tonight, remember?",1
LORELAI,"Yeah, but you have to eat. Come have a quick burger.",1
RORY,No thanks.,1
LORELAI,Oh! What is that?,1
RORY,It's for school.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, he's so cute! What's his name?",1
RORY,Case Study Number Twelve.,1
LORELAI,"Is it hyphenated? Honey, he's adorable. He should have a name.",1
RORY,"I'm not bonding with my midterm, thank you.",1
LORELAI,"Alright, I'll name him. Hi! Your name is Stanley. Hi, Stanley.",1
RORY,It's a girl.,1
LORELAI,Oh. Sorry about the Stanley thing. Your name is Stella. Stella's nice and Stella was married to Stanley.,1
RORY,Call it whatever you want.,1
LORELAI,You're grumpy. What happened?,1
RORY,"Nothing, just a long day.",1
LORELAI,You know what the remedy for a long day is? A ringside seat while Luke envisions strangling me w ith his baseball cap.,1
RORY,I'm gonna leave the chick here for the night so the kitten doesn't get any fancy ideas.,1
LORELAI,OK.,1
RORY,She's already been fed and if she gets too loud just put her in my room. I'll call you later.,1
LORELAI,OK. Hey...are you OK?,1
RORY,Yeah. Just a bad afternoon. I'll fix it.,1
LORELAI,OK. Call me if you need a wrench or something.,1
RORY,I will.,1
LORELAI,Stella.,1
LORELAI,"Now, this is another way to go. Sort of a French bistro kind of look.",1
LUKE,This isn't a French bistro,1
LORELAI,Really? Huh. It's amazing the things you learn when you bother to listen.,1
LUKE,Which you usually don't.,1
LORELAI,"Yes, but then I don't have a lot of useless information intruding in my brain.",1
LUKE,Thank God.,1
LORELAI,"Now, if you wanted to do more warm, golden Tuscan countryside --",1
LUKE,"Then I'd go to Italy. Here, I'll wrap this up.",1
LORELAI,"We could also go with a pastely English country garden theme. Oh, maybe we could add a little stenciling on the ceiling.",1
LUKE,No stencling!,1
LORELAI,Excuse me -- do you even know what stenciling is?,1
LUKE,Does Martha Stewart do it?,1
LORELAI,Yes.,1
LUKE,No stenciling.,1
TAYLORory,Ask him.,1
KIRK,I will.,1
TAYLORory,"Well, go on.",1
KIRK,"Don't push. Hello, Luke.",1
LUKE,"What do you want, Kirk?",1
KIRK,Taylor here tells me that you're thinking of painting this place.,1
LORELAI,"That's right, he is.",1
TAYLORory,Ha!,1
KIRK,"Excuse me, I'd like to hear it from him. Luke, is--is it true?",1
LUKE,"Yes, Kirk, it is true.",1
KIRK,Really?,1
LUKE,Yes.,1
KIRK,And that's your final decision?,1
LUKE,I'm afraid it is.,1
KIRK,Because it's not too late to --,1
TAYLORory,You heard him! He's painting this place. Pay up.,1
TAYLORory,Thank you.,1
LUKE,"Sorry, man.",1
KIRK,"It's a little too late for that, don't you think?",1
TAYLORory,"Ooh, I like this.",1
LORELAI,"OK, I get it.",1
RORY,Hold on. There you go. Meow if you need anything else.,1
RORY,"Hi, is Dean in? This is Rory. Oh. Well, will you tell him I called? OK, thanks.",1
LORELAI,You ready to talk paint?,1
LUKE,No.,1
LORELAI,"Good. I've got all the choices set up and while any one of them would work, I think this combo is currently my favorite.",1
LUKE,Huh.,1
LORELAI,"See? Imagine. This will be for the walls and this will be for the trim -- the, like, edging around the doors and the windows.",1
LUKE,I know what the trim is.,1
LORELAI,"OK. The colors are actually quite similar to what you have here now, but they're just a little richer, a little warmer. What do you think?",1
LUKE,Well.,1
LORELAI,"Wait, wait, wait.",1
LORELAI,A little ambiance.,1
LUKE,This is a diner. We don't do ambiance.,1
LORELAI,All right. One argument at a time. So what do you think?,1
LUKE,Honestly?,1
LORELAI,Yep.,1
LUKE,I have no idea. You like it?,1
LORELAI,Yeah.,1
LUKE,OK.,1
LORELAI,Good.,1
LUKE,What are you doing?,1
ANDREW,"Oh -- um, the town council wanted to do a before and after poster.",1
LUKE,Out!,1
ANDREW,Bye.,1
LUKE,That's it. We're closed for the night.,1
LORELAI,"You know, listen -- since you have to take everything off the walls to decide what stuff you're going to keep and what stuff you're to get rid of.",1
LUKE,Everything stays.,1
LORELAI,"OK, there's a plastic dancing pork chop that says --",1
LUKE,Everything stays.,1
LORELAI,"""I lost my head over a good chop. You should too.""",1
LUKE,Everything stays.,1
LORELAI,Ok. Everything stays.,1
LUKE,"You know, this place hasn't been painted since my dad was alive.",1
LORELAI,"No, I didn't know that.",1
LUKE,He painted it before he opened it and once more when the roof caved in one winter. I think that's probably it.,1
LORELAI,The paint lasted a long time. He got his money's worth.,1
LUKE,"Yep. He really loved this place, you know. This store was his life. Mine too, I guess. I spent every minute I wasn't in school here. I spent a lot of minutes I was supposed to be in school in here too.",1
LORELAI,How come you opened a diner? Why didn't you keep it a hardware store?,1
LUKE,"I don't know. I didn't love the hardware business the way my dad did, and, you know, I knew how to cook, so I just thought a diner would be more...fun.",1
LORELAI,That's a hard word for you to say.,1
LUKE,Yeah. I just always wanted to work here. Just where Dad did.,1
LORELAI,God that's nice. To be so -- I don't know -- connected to your dad. That's -- I would have loved that.,1
LUKE,Well you've got that with Rory.,1
LORELAI,Yeah...I guess so.,1
LUKE,"You know, I still think there's a spot on the wall somewhere where my dad took an order one day when he ran out of paper.",1
LORELAI,Really? Where?,1
LUKE,I don't know. Behind the counter maybe.,1
LUKE,Next to the door. On the right side.,1
LORELAI,Oh. Huh. Here it,1
is,"""Three hammers, Phillips-head screwdrivers --""",1
LUKE,"""and three boxes of nails in assorted sizes.""",1
LORELAI,Oh.,1
LUKE,I've seen it from time to time.,1
LUKE,"Yeah, well, I guess it is time for a little spruce.",1
LORELAI,"Yeah, it is. But let's not spruce this particular spot.",1
LUKE,That sounds good.,1
LORELAI,OK.,1
LUKE,"Oh, jeez --",1
LORELAI,"No, no, don't get up.",1
LUKE,But if I don't get up --,1
LORELAI,"They'll go away. They'll go away, trust me. Shh.",1
TAYLORory,What are they doing? They should be in there. Just imagine it all in pastels. The whole thing.,1
LUKE,Thank you.,1
LORELAI,You're,1
welcome,I should go.,1
LUKE,OK.,1
LORELAI,"Ah, so. It's going to be great.",1
LUKE,"Oh, I'm sure it is.",1
LORELAI,See ya.,1
LUKE,See ya.,1
RORY,Lane?,1
LANE,Yo.,1
RORY,Hey how's it going?,1
LANE,"Very well. I have discovered that in addition to my lameness in geometry I also will not become a b iologist, French translator, or Civil w*r buff.",1
RORY,Well I guess that just leaves bass player for the Foo Fighters.,1
LANE,I also wouldn't rule out keyboardist in the Siouxsie and the Banshees reunion tour.,1
RORY,I like that you keep an open mind.,1
LANE,So what's up?,1
RORY,I need to borrow a CD.,1
LANE,Which one?,1
RORY,The weird one.,1
LANE,I need more information.,1
RORY,I don't know which one it is but I'd know it if I saw it.,1
LANE,"OK, well let's have a look.",1
LANE,"We have classic rock, progressive rock, pretty boy rock --",1
RORY,Excuse me?,1
LANE,"Bon Jovi, Duran Duran, The Wallflowers, Bush.",1
RORY,Got it. Next?,1
LANE,"Punk, New Wave, German metal bands. Broadway soundtracks.",1
RORY,Interesting filing systerm.,1
LANE,Anything yet?,1
RORY,"Nope, sorry.",1
LANE,"OK, well over there we have jazz, jazz vocals, classical, country, rockabilly, Sinatra -- The Capitol Years. Oh wait! The miscellaneous section.",1
RORY,"Hey, that sounds right. William Shatner. Is this the one where he sings Tambourine Man?",1
LANE,And Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.,1
RORY,"Remind me to get this for my mom for her birthday. Oh wait. Hey, that's it. Can I?",1
LANE,Take it.,1
RORY,Thanks.,1
LANE,So what are you doing?,1
RORY,"Um, I'm not completely sure yet.",1
LANE,OK. Well I want details.,1
LORELAI,Stella!,1
LORELAI,"Oh, no. No, no. OK. Stella, do something. Show yourself. Molt or chirp or something. Oh this is so not funny. Not funny, not funny. Oh this is so unbelivable. All day long, just chirps like a maniac at the top of her lungs. Now, nothing. Silence. Marcel Marceau chicken. OK, that's OK. I can fix this. We can fix this.",1
LORELAI,I'm going to make this better. I'm going to fix --,1
LORELAI,Hello?,1
LUKE,Yeah.,1
LORELAI,Luke? Stella got out and I don't know -- do I put seed on the floor? Do I make cheeping sounds? Or do I pull a Lucy Ricardo and walk like a chicken so she thinks I'm her mother?,1
LUKE,Who the hell is this?,1
LORELAI,What do you mean who is this? It's Lorelai. Who else would call you looking for her baby chick?,1
LUKE,You're right. I'm the idiot. Go on.,1
LORELAI,"Could you come over here, please, and help me?",1
LUKE,"Uh, yeah, OK. I'll be right over.",1
LORELAI,"OK, hurry!",1
LORELAI,Thank God. Get in here.,1
LUKE,This place is a disaster. What's going on?,1
LORELAI,"OK, the last sighting was here, by the InStyle magazine. But then she burrowed through the Glamour and jumped over the Cosmo and knocked over a brand new bottle of nail polish so all I can tell you is if there was any doubt that this chick was a girl, well, there isn't anymore.",1
LORELAI,"OK, there she is!",1
LUKE,Jeez -- what was that?,1
LORELAI,Stella! Stella!,1
LUKE,You really do have a chick loose in here.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, I told you I had a chick loose in here. There she goes by the kitchen!",1
LORELAI,Don't step on her!,1
LUKE,She cut right in front of me.,1
LORELAI,"OK, well she's being graded so let's not squash her.",1
LUKE,Well then tell her to watch where she's going.,1
RORY,Hello?,1
DEAN,"Um, I wasn't sure if you still wanted me to come over.",1
RORY,"Oh, I do. I do, I absolutely do.",1
DEAN,Are you sure?,1
RORY,"Yeah, I'm totally and completely -- You're teasing me.",1
DEAN,"Yeah, a little. But I did appreciate the enthusiasm.",1
RORY,So how long until you get here?,1
DEAN,"Actually, not long at all.",1
RORY,Why where are you?,1
DEAN,Right outside.,1
DEAN,"Uh, what the --",1
RORY,"Honey, you're home.",1
RORY,"Well, say something.",1
DEAN,Trick or treat?,1
RORY,What? You don't like it?,1
DEAN,"No, I do. It's -- uh -- it's got a large circumference.",1
RORY,Thank you. Now come on in. It's cold outside.,1
DEAN,Oh my God.,1
RORY,"Here, let me take your coat.",1
DEAN,"Uh, thank you.",1
RORY,You're welcome.,1
DEAN,Interesting music.,1
RORY,I'm glad you like it.,1
DEAN,So what's that?,1
RORY,"Oh, just some ap petizers before dinner.",1
DEAN,Before dinner?,1
RORY,Yeah.,1
DEAN,Are we going out?,1
RORY,No.,1
DEAN,Ordering pizza?,1
RORY,Nope.,1
DEAN,So...?,1
RORY,I made you dinner.,1
DEAN,Excuse me?,1
RORY,"Steak, green beans, mashed potatoes --",1
DEAN,"Wait, you made me dinner?",1
RORY,That's right.,1
DEAN,You made me dinner.,1
RORY,And dessert.,1
DEAN,"OK, what is going on here?",1
RORY,"I'm sorry, I thought it was obvious. It's Donna Reed night.",1
LORELAI,"I swear, she went over there.",1
LUKE,We looked over there.,1
LORELAI,"Well, she went under that chair and she didn't come out.",1
LUKE,"We moved the chair, we searched the floor, nothing.",1
LORELAI,Well then she went under the chair and through a hole in the floor.,1
LUKE,There is no hole in the floor.,1
LORELAI,Well maybe there was a hole in the floor and she crawled through it and fixed it.,1
LUKE,So she's s super intelligent chick with great physical and deductive skills?,1
LORELAI,Yes.,1
LUKE,"Oh, this is not a chick I want to find.",1
LORELAI,"Hey, Luke, what did you mean earlier?",1
LUKE,What are you talking about?,1
LORELAI,When you got here. You made some comment about me not really having a chick in the house.,1
LUKE,Hmm.,1
LORELAI,"I mean, if I didn't have a chick here, why did you think I was calling?",1
LUKE,"No, I thought you were calling about the chick.",1
LORELAI,It didn't seem like it.,1
LUKE,Well maybe it didn't seem like it but it was.,1
LORELAI,Was what?,1
LUKE,Was what I thought -- can we just keep looking?,1
LORELAI,OK. I just still think that --,1
LUKE,There she is.,1
LORELAI,Where?,1
LUKE,There!,1
LORELAI,Careful.,1
RORY,Well?,1
DEAN,What can I say?,1
RORY,You can say it's perfect.,1
DEAN,It's perfect.,1
RORY,Thank you. How is it really?,1
DEAN,It's perfect.,1
RORY,Yeah?,1
DEAN,"It's amazing. I mean, I've never had anyone make dinner for me before. Except my mom, and, believe me, it's not the same.",1
RORY,I'm extremely glad to hear that.,1
RORY,"Wait, wait, you want to save room for dessert, right?",1
DEAN,"Oh, that's right. So...what's for dessert?",1
RORY,Lime Fan tasy Supreme.,1
DEAN,Which is?,1
RORY,Green Jell-o and Cool Whip!,1
DEAN,You are insane.,1
RORY,"Oh, no, I forgot to make the rolls.",1
DEAN,What?,1
RORY,I was going to make rolls.,1
DEAN,Well that's OK.,1
RORY,I can't belive I forgot them.,1
DEAN,What are you doing?,1
RORY,I'll make 'em now.,1
DEAN,"Hold on, it's -- come on, we really don't need rolls.",1
RORY,Donna Reed would have never forgotten the rolls. They're gonna make me turn in my pearls.,1
DEAN,I promise I'll kick anyone's butt who comes near those pearls.,1
DEAN,Rory?,1
RORY,Yes?,1
DEAN,"As amazing as this whole thing was, I mean, the music, the outfit, the dinner, I hope you know that I don't expect you to be Donna Reed. And I don't want you to be Donna Reed. That's not what I meant. This just totally got blown out of proportion. I'm actually pretty happy with you.",1
RORY,"I know and I appreciate that, but aside from this actually being fun, I did a little research on Donna Reed.",1
DEAN,You did research on Donna Reed.,1
RORY,"Look. See, she did do the whole milk and cookies wholesome big skirt thing, but aside from that, she was an uncredited producer and director on her television show, which made her one of the first women television executives. Which is actually pretty impressive.",1
DEAN,Well I'm glad this turned out to be such a positive experience for you.,1
RORY,"It has been. And even though I'll probably never get the feeling back in my left little toe, I'd do it again.",1
DEAN,Yeah?,1
RORY,Someday. But for now I'd better get these dishes cleaned up.,1
DEAN,"Oh, well, I'll help.",1
RORY,"Sorry, you're a man. You can't help for another fifteen years.",1
DEAN,"OK, well, then, as the man I will do what the man is supposed to do.",1
RORY,Go bowling?,1
DEAN,Take out the trash.,1
LORELAI,"She's never going anywhere ever again. I'm thinking of slipping some super glue on the bottom of the cage. That would be bad, right? I mean, I know staples are bad but what's the verdict on super glue?",1
LUKE,Ask Stella.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, you don't have to do that.",1
LUKE,This stuff is sharp. I want to get it out of the way.,1
LORELAI,"Well, thanks for helping.",1
LUKE,No problem. I'm going to throw this stuff outside.,1
DEAN,Hey.,1
LUKE,Hey.,1
DEAN,What are you doing here?,1
LUKE,What are you doing here?,1
DEAN,You first.,1
LUKE,I'm looking for a chick.,1
DEAN,"Yeah, me too.",1
LUKE,You are not.,1
DEAN,"Well, neither are you.",1
LORELAI,"Hey, Luke, is there -- Dean.",1
DEAN,"Uh, Lorelai, hi.",1
LORELAI,Fancy meet ing you here.,1
LUKE,Yeah.,1
DEAN,"Well, uh --",1
RORY,"Hey, the Jell-o is doing this weird melting thing and I -- oh, Mom, Luke.",1
LUKE,Rory.,1
RORY,Hi.,1
LORELAI,"Uh, what the hell are you two doing?",1
DEAN,"Nothing. She, uh -- well we ate dinner. You know, steak and beans --",1
RORY,Canned.,1
LORELAI,Canned.,1
RORY,Not fresh.,1
DEAN,No.,1
LORELAI,No.,1
DEAN,And potatoes.,1
RORY,From a box.,1
DEAN,But they were still good.,1
RORY,Thank you.,1
DEAN,You're welcome.,1
RORY,So what were you guys doing?,1
LORELAI,Oh. Uh -- In the house...,1
LUKE,And then the lamp sorta -- I'm gonna get going.,1
LORELAI,Yeah.,1
LUKE,I'm sorry about this.,1
LORELAI,Forget it.,1
LUKE,OK. Bye.,1
DEAN,"Yeah, I probably better go too. Thanks for dinner.",1
RORY,You're welcome.,1
RORY,What?,1
LORELAI,"Well, OK, you're 16. You have a whole house to yourself for the evening. I expect that you're going to have your boyfriend over. But what is with the apron?",1
RORY,It's a long story.,1
LORELAI,Did it involve a sharp blow to the head?,1
RORY,I gotta go check on Apricot.,1
LORELAI,Oh my God! I just saw the pearls.,1
RORY,I'm going in now.,1
LORELAI,You know what? I'm going inside too. 'Cause I have to write down all the ways I'm gonna t*rture you about that outfit.,1
RORY,Good night!,1
LORELAI,"Could I just get a picture though? 'Cause visual aids would really help. Oh, oh! Oh the shoes! I am dying. Oh.",1
RORY,Mom! I can't find Apricot!,1
LORELAI,What? No!,1
RORY,"She was on the couch when I came out, and now, nowhere.",1
LORELAI,That's it! We are not animal people! Period.,1
MICHELorelai,It was a tiny little favor.,1
SOOKIE,"We have had this discussion before, Michel.",1
MICHELorelai,You are being unreasonable.,1
SOOKIE,I have my standards.,1
MICHELorelai,But this is a simple request.,1
SOOKIE,You are asking me to compromise my artistic and my culinary values.,1
LORELAI,Michel wanted an egg white omelette.,1
SOOKIE,Yes.,1
LORELAI,Crazy man.,1
MICHELorelai,"Why? Why am I crazy man? I didn't have time for breakfast this morning, so very nicely I asked her to make me an egg white omelette cooked very dry with some tomatoes, mushroom, maybe a little chives, and she gives me this.",1
LORELAI,What is this?,1
SOOKIE,A three egg omelette with goat cheese cooked in a sherry olive oil.,1
MICHELorelai,I don't eat dairy or meat. You know this.,1
SOOKIE,"I am a chef, Michel. It is my job to make food that tastes good.",1
LORELAI,And you do sister!,1
MICHELorelai,But I can't eat like that and look like her.,1
LORELAI,You don't know what you're missing.,1
MICHELorelai,That will k*ll you.,1
LORELAI,You gotta go someday.,1
MICHELorelai,"But someday all of this will catch up with you. You will become the balloon lady, and with any luck I will be here to enjoy it.",1
LORELAI,But you make a good egg white omelette.,1
SOOKIE,I know.,1
LORELAI,Ah. Who wants to hear about my night?,1
SOOKIE,"Oh, me!",1
LORELAI,"Well, it started with Rory's baby chick getting loose in the house and ended with Rory and I up at one in the morning looking for Morey and Babette's new kitten, who we found asleep in the piano.",1
SOOKIE,"Wow, that's very Wild Kingdom of you.",1
LORELAI,Yeah. I'm like the Marlin Perkins of Stars Hollow.,1
SOOKIE,You want some coffe?,1
LORELAI,Please.,1
SOOKIE,So how's Rory's chick?,1
LORELAI,"Uh, better than my lemon lamp.",1
SOOKIE,What's the matter with your lemon lamp?,1
LORELAI,Luke k*lled it.,1
SOOKI,On purpose?,1
LORELAI,"Well I can't prove it, but I will.",1
SOOKIE,What was Luke doing there?,1
LORELAI,Well I called him when I got home and Stella wasn't there.,1
SOOKIE,Stella is the chick?,1
LORELAI,Yes.,1
SOOKIE,I like that name.,1
LORELAI,'Streetcar Named Desire'.,1
SOOKIE,Vivian Leigh or Jessica Tandy?,1
LORELAI,Hello -- Tandy.,1
SOOKIE,Of course. Continue.,1
LORELAI,"So I evaluated the situation in my usual calm, collected manner --",1
SOOKIE,Hmm.,1
LORELAI,And then I called Luke to help me track her down.,1
SOOKIE,That's when he broke the lamp?,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, he's not very graceful. You know, he said the weirdest thing.",1
SOOKIE,'May I break your lamp?',1
LORELAI,"Well he got there and I was looking for Stella and he said, 'Oh, you really do have a baby chick loose in the house,' like I made that up, or -- I don't know.",1
SOOKIE,Well.,1
LORELAI,Well what?,1
SOOKIE,"Well you call someone and you say, 'Can you come over and help me look for my loose chick?' It's a little...",1
LORELAI,A little what?,1
SOOKIE,"It sounds a little like the code for, 'I'm not wearing any underwear.'",1
LORELAI,That's not the code for 'I'm not wearing any underwear.',1
SOOKIE,OK.,1
LORELAI,"Sookie, you're not serious?",1
SOOKIE,"Look, the first time Jackson and I...you know.",1
LORELAI,Yeah.,1
SOOKIE,Yeah. I called him up and I told him I had a bat in my attic.,1
LORELAI,"Well, honey, you do have a bat in your attic.",1
SOOKIE,"So, he came over and went in the attic and he knew there was no bat and I knew there was no bat, but we pretended to look for it, and then when we couldn't find ""the bat"" we went downstairs and we had a bottle of wine..",1
LORELAI,So you're saying Luke thought I made up a crazy story about a chick being loose in the house just to get him in bed?,1
SOOKIE,"Not just to get him in bed, but maybe he thought you wanted to see him and you didn't know how to say it.",1
LORELAI,That's nuts. SOOKIE A woman asking a man to come over late at night to her house. Come on.,1
LORELAI,Yeah. But this is Luke we're talking about.,1
SOOKIE,Uh-huh. Why did you call him?,1
LORELAI,Because I needed help.,1
SOOKIE,Yeah. Why didn't you call me?,1
LORELAI,Because I assumed you would be with Jackson.,1
SOOKIE,Uh-huh.,1
LORELAI,Well I did.,1
SOOKIE,Why didn't you call Rory?,1
LORELAI,Because she would have been furious to find out that Stella was missing.,1
SOOKEI,Why didn't you call Patty? She raises chickens.,1
LORELAI,Sookie.,1
SOOKIE,"Or Andrew? He lives right around the corner, doesn't he?",1
LORELAI,What is your point?,1
SOOKIE,"My point is that you called Luke. Out of all the people in town that you could have called that would have come over and dropped what they were doing, you called Luke.",1
LORELAI,Because I had just been with him. We were picking out paint samples. He was on my mind. It was purely a timing thing.,1
SOOKIE,Picking out samples.,1
LORELAI,Yes.,1
SOOKIE,For Luke's place.,1
LORELAI,Yes.,1
SOOKIE,So you could paint together.,1
LORELAI,"Once again, yes!",1
SOOKIE,Mm-hmm. Which I believe was your idea.,1
LORELAI,"OK, so now the fact that I suggested painting Luke's diner also means that I wanted to get him in bed. All of a sudden I'm trying to get any poor, unsuspecting person in bed with me. I'm like - - I'm Michael Douglas!",1
SOOKIE,Lorelai. This --,1
LORELAI,Just -- thanks for the omelette.,1
SOOKIE,"No, honey, I'm sorry. I don't want you to be mad. Don't be mad at me.",1
LORELAI,"I'm not mad, I'm not mad. I'm tired.",1
SOOKIE,"OK. You know, Luke is a really nice man.",1
LORELAI,"Bye, Sookie.",1
EMILY,"Rory, Lorelai.",1
LORELAI,"Hey, we thought maybe the doorbell wasn't working.",1
EMILY,Come in .,1
LORELAI,We were ringing it and ringing it and nobody -- I guess we'll just come in.,1
EMILY,And that would be the same as what we were paying for our old place? JOHN : Exactly the same.,1
RICHARD,Except for the grounds fees.,1
JOHN,Well the grounds fees are higher.,1
EMILY,"But the grounds are larger, Richard.",1
RICHARD,"I'm just trying to get all the information, Emily.",1
EMILY,All the information is that this is our last chance to go to Martha's Vineyard for the season. That's all the information.,1
JOHN,"Emily, Richard.",1
RICHARD,"I realize the position we are in, but this is a business transaction.",1
EMILY,Oh for heaven's sake.,1
JOHN,"Richard, Emily",1
RICHARD,"As a business transaction, one in which money goes out and we receive certain goods and services --",1
EMILY,"And he's patronizing me, how lovely.",1
JOHN,"Emily, Richard.",1
RICHARD,I must treat this conversation with the same care and devotion to detail I would any conversation that would be considered a business transaction. Kindly allow me to do so.,1
JOHN,Richard! Emily! Please!,1
EMILY,"Goodness, you startled me.",1
JOHN,"I'm sorry, I just wanted to say that I'm sure we could negotiate the grounds fee.",1
RICHARD,"Well, that will be fine.",1
JOHN,Good. I'll get into this right now and I'll get back to you.,1
EMILY,"Thank you, John.",1
RICHARD,"Yes, we'll talk to you later.",1
JOHN,Bye.,1
EMILY,"Careful, Richard. That canary you ate is going to spoil your dinner.",1
LORELAI,What's going on?,1
RICHARD,"Oh, your mother and I have just secured a place on Martha's Vineyard.",1
RORY,"Really, that's great!",1
LORELAI,I thought you lost your old place.,1
EMILY,We did. But this afternoon we found out that Arthur Roundtree had died.,1
RICHARD,He'd been drinking.,1
EMILY,So we got on the phone and snatched that place up.,1
RICHARD,"Oh, it's a fine piece of property.",1
EMILY,Much better than our usual place.,1
LORELAI,"The both of you are going directly to hell, I hope you know that.",1
RICHARD,"Well, at least we'll be well rested.",1
LORELAI,Touche.,1
EMILY,I am so thrilled about this.,1
RICHARD,I'm glad.,1
EMILY,The two of you must come up for the weekend. It is so lovely. Rory would just love it.,1
RORY,Can we go for a weekend?,1
LORELAI,"We'll see how much Valium Auntie Sookie can lend Mommy, OK?",1
EMILY,"The only drawback of course, is that we had to rent the place furnished, and Arthur had dreadful taste. Rememb er the library, Richard?",1
RICHARD,Pink and green! Horrible. Just horrible.,1
LORELAI,Well he's dead now so he got his.,1
EMILY,"Lorelai, you're being morbid.",1
LORELAI,I'm being morbid?,1
RORY,New subject please!,1
LORELAI,Joan and Melissa Rivers here think I'm being morbid.,1
EMILY,"Rory, what's new in your life?",1
RORY,"Nothing. Just school, homework.",1
LORELAI,Aprons.,1
RORY,Do not go there.,1
EMILY,"What does she mean, aprons?",1
LORELAI,Nothing. I was just teasing her.,1
EMILY,About aprons?,1
LORELAI,Yeah.,1
EMILY,I don't understand,1
LORELAI,It's not important.,1
EMILY,Then humor me.,1
LORELAI,Nothing. Rory just dressed up in a cute apron the other day and so I was teasing her about it.,1
RICHARD,Why did you get dressed up in an apron?,1
LORELAI,"Well. We've decided to give up on that pesky Harvard dream and focus on something more realistic. Mom, Dad, Rory's decided to become a maid, just like I was. Is that funny? Did she think that was funny?",1
RICHARD,What would have posessed you to say such a thing?,1
EMILY,And in front of Rory?,1
LORELAI,I was kidding.,1
EMILY,God. My heart stopped.,1
LORELAI,Why don't you tell them about your bird? That seems like a safe subject.,1
RICHARD,Your bird?,1
RORY,"Yeah, it's for school. Each of us have to follow a chick through its entire growth process.Everything has to be logged. Eating habits, sleeping habits.",1
LORELAI,Houdini habits.,1
RORY,She got out.,1
LORELAI,She ran far.,1
RORY,But she lived.,1
LORELAI,She's a better bird for it.,1
RORY,Thank God Luke found her.,1
EMILY,Luke found her?,1
LORELAI,What?,1
EMILY,Rory said that Luke found her.,1
LORELAI,Paying me back for the apron thing?,1
RORY,Sorry.,1
EMILY,Did the bird get loose at Luke's diner?,1
LORELAI,No.,1
EMILY,No?,1
LORELAI,The bird got loose at home.,1
EMILY,Your home?,1
LORELAI,Yes.,1
EMILY,Ah.,1
RORY,"So, Grandpa, when's your next trip?",1
RICHARD,"Ah, Madrid, the twelfth.",1
RORY,Wow.,1
RICHARD,I think there's a nice addition of cervantes in it for you.,1
RORY,Gracias.,1
EMILY,What was Luke doing at your house?,1
LORELAI,"Oh, look, there's no ice. I'll get some.",1
EMILY,I asked you a question.,1
LORELAI,"He was helping me find the bird, Mom.",1
EMILY,Really?,1
LORELAI,"Yes, really.",1
EMILY,"And how did he know that the bird was missing? What, was he strolling by your house and he heard your plaintive cries for help?",1
LORELAI,Mom.,1
EMILY,Or the helpless cheep of a chick in trouble?,1
LORELAI,"I called him, Mom. OK? I called him and asked him to come over and help me look for the bird. OK?",1
EMILY,It seems like this man is always around when you're in trouble.,1
LORELAI,He's a good friend.,1
EMILY,"Oh, please.",1
LORELAI,"Do we have to discuss this? EMILY Lorelai, I'm getting a little tired of being lied to.",1
LORELAI,Apparently we do.,1
EMILY,"This man was at Rory's birthday party, he came to the hospital with you, he's the male lead in every story you tell, you go to the diner every single day. I've seen the way he looks at you, the way you look at him. I'm not a fool.",1
LORELAI,"Mom, please.",1
EMILY,"Why do you treat me like I don't have a clue in the world as to what is going on in your life? Now I'm asking you, as a favor, if you have any respect for me at all as your mother, just tell me. Do you have feelings for this man?",1
LORELAI,I don't know. Maybe I do. I haven't given it much thought. Maybe I do.,1
EMILY,Thank you. I'm glad you were finally honest with me. Now we can discuss what on earth you could possibly be thinking. Don't forget the ice.,1
LUKE,"So, you're sure we need this many cans?",1
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, you need enough for two coats and touchups and little spots. No, I'm not sure.",1
LUKE,"Well we got the paint and the brushes and the tarps and all the other stuff the paint guy said we'd need, so I guess we're ready.",1
LORELAI,Yes we are.,1
LUKE,The only thing left to do is figure out when.,1
LORELAI,How about Friday?,1
LUKE,Friday?,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, I mean, you don't want the stuff sitting around. I don't know if paint goes bad, but judging by the smell of it when it's fresh, rotten paint would be really gross.",1
LUKE,Don't you have dinner with your folks on Friday?,1
LORELAI,"Well, yeah, but I can get out early for a special occasion.",1
LUKE,Friday it is.,1
LORELAI,Good.,1
RORY,Hey.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, hey, you!",1
RORY,Jeez -- you think you got enough paint?,1
LORELAI,"I know, I tried to tell him. So, dinner, thoughts?",1
RORY,Let's have some.,1
LORELAI,How about Chinese?,1
RORY,Sounds good.,1
LORELAI,OK. I need to stop at the market and get some fruit.,1
RORY,Why?,1
LORELAI,I think I'm getting scurvy.,1
RORY,Really?,1
LORELAI,"Yeah. Well that or a cold, but either way, I need some fruit.",1
TAYLORory,"Damn motorcycles, they're a scourge.",1
RORY,Yeah.,1
LORELAI,Yeah.,1
TAYLORory,"They're loud, they're dangerous. We should ban them from town.",1
LORELAI,Maybe we should set up barricades and ban all unwelcome strangers from crossing the border.,1
TAYLORory,"Well! Well, no we couldn't do that, that would be illegal.",1
LORELAI,Darn laws.,1
TAYLORory,"Oh, got to get away from that noise. Taylor goes inside the market.)",1
LORELAI,k*ll me an d bury me w ith that bike.,1
RORY,What is it? A Harley?,1
LORELAI,"That is a 2000 Indian, 80 horsepower, 5 speed close ratio Andrews transmission and I want to get one.",1
RORY,No.,1
LORELAI,Why not?,1
RORY,You'd die.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, that.",1
CHRISTOHPERory,Hey.,1
LORELAI,Hi.,1

LORELAI,Christopher.,1
RORY,Dad!,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Hey!,1

CHRISTOPHERory,"I'm here to see you. And your mom, who's not saying anything about as loud as a person can.",1
LORELAI,Hello.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"A word. Maybe there's a phrase in my future. OK, why is that man staring at me?",1
RORY,That's Taylor Doose. He owns the market. He knows all and sees all.,1
LORELAI,"So, what's with the just showing up, Mr. Spontaneity Guy?",1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, my folks are back in Connecticut so I'm here to see them, and on the way I thought I'd stop by and surprise the Gilmore girls. Are you surprised?",1
LORELAI,"Oh, the teeniest feather could knock me in the gutter.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,,1
RORY,"Stay, really? You're staying?",1
CHRISTOPHERory,Thinking about it.,1
RORY,Stay with us!,1
LORELAI,"Um, sweetie...",1
CHRISTOPHERory,I don't think your mom --,1
LORELAI,"No, it's not that, I'm still surprised.",1
RORY,"Mom, please.",1
LORELAI,Why don't you stay with us for a couple of days?,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Thanks, Lor. You won't even know I'm there. Hey, hop on.",1
LORELAI,Hop off.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Hop on.,1

RORY,I like his hair shorter.,1
LORELAI,Short is nice.,1
RORY,Do you think he'll stay long?,1
LORELAI,Wouldn't bet a lot of money on it.,1
RORY,Maybe we can get him to stay for a couple of weeks.,1
LORELAI,Absolutely - by weighting him down with blankets.,1
RORY,I just want him to be comfortable.,1
LORELAI,"He's gonna come an d go as he pleases babe, you know that.",1
RORY,"Yeah, I know.",1
LORELAI,And no amount of bedding is gonna change that.,1
RORY,"Yeah, but he's never been to Stars Hollow before.",1
LORELAI,I know.,1
RORY,Well that means something's gotta be different right?,1
LORELAI,Why don't you just enjoy the time you've got ok?,1
RORY,"Yeah, ok. I still think something is different though.",1
Posted,03/13/01 18:32,1
CHRISTOPHERory,That is the worst shower I have ever had. Water pressure keeps changing every two seconds. I'm fixing it tomorrow.,1
LORELAI,Hey you stay away from my shower.,1
RORY,We ordered chinese food. It should be here any minute.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Good, I'm starving.",1
LORELAI,Here,1
RORY,"Hey, how's Diane?",1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Uh, Diane is ancient history.",1
RORY,When I met her at Easter you said she could be the one.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,The one to be gone by Memorial Day.,1
RORY,You're worse than mom.,1
LORELAI,Low blow.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Can't keep a feller happy?,1
LORELAI,Oh I keep them happy. I keep them very happy.,1
RORY,"Ok, now. Don't get gross.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,Yeah you're upsetting us.,1
RORY,I'm gonna go study before the food gets here.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,What? Tomorrow's Saturday.,1
RORY,"I know, I like to get my weekend homework done and out of the way by Saturday night so then I can do extra-credit stuff on Sunday",1
LORELAI,Don't look at me.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"She's a great kid Lor. I wish I could say I see more of myself in her other than we have similar left ear lobes, but she's all you - chip off the old...perfect block.",1
LORELAI,Why the hell are you here?,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Behold the queen of the subtle transition.,1
LORELAI,Why are you here?,1
CHRISTOPHERory,You're gonna force me to lawyer up officer.,1
LORELAI,Christopher.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Ok look. I've been making some changes, especially my career and I think I finally have all my ducks lined up in a row.",1
LORELAI,You're opening a sh**ting gallery.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,I've been tying up loose ends in my life.,1
LORELAI,Do they make that much string?,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"You know you've always had that verbal thing, quick mind - it's annoying.",1
LORELAI,So you've been tying up loose ends.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"I don't know how much your dad has told you but I'm on the verge of kind of a big success, it's for real this time. I've got a company with an actual cash flow, I've got employees, I've got an accountant for God's sake. He wears a tie and says words like  fiduciary' and  ironically'. I mean it's for real this time Lor.",1
LORELAI,I would love to believe it is.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Why does your dad have more faith in my than you.,1
LORELAI,My father hit his head surfing Rincon a couple of years ago. His judgement's a little off.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,So you have zero faith?,1
LORELAI,I've known you since I was six Chris. You're the guy that crashed his Porsche two hours after his parents gave it to him for his 16th birthday.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,And you were the girl in the Pinky Tuscadero t-shirt sitting right next to me.,1
LORELAI,Horrified.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Think again.,1
LORELAI,"Alright, having a blast then horrified.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,Just listen to me w ill you?,1
LORELAI,"I'm listening to you. Your life's back on track, I think that's great. And I appreciate you coming all the way out here, for the very first time might I add, to tell us that.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,I didn't come out here just to tell you that.,1
LORELAI,No?,1
CHRISTOPHERory,There's some things I need to do...to take care of.,1
LORELAI,Like?,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"I haven't been enough a part of Rory's life. So I wanna be around more, to be a pal she can depend on. I mean I'm not crazy, I know there's already a life going on here and God knows she doesn't need anyone besides you but...if you give me a chance...",1
LORELAI,I've always had the door to Rory open for you.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,I know.,1
LORELAI,You've hardly ever used it.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Well I wanna use it now. Is that ok?,1
LORELAI,Of course it is.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Good.,1
RORY,"Hey, I forgot to ask you. Tomorrow morning I'm going to a softball game, do you wanna come?",1
CHRISTOPHERory,You...play softball?,1
RORY,"Uh, no.",1
LORELAI,You? Play softball? Good one.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well ok, who's game is it?",1
RORY,It's my friend Dean's.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Dean?,1
RORY,Yeah Dean. The game starts at 9:00.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Uh, sure. It's a date. She has a Dean?",1
LORELAI,She has a Dean.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,How did this happen?,1
LORELAI,Well a single-celled organism crawled out of primordial ooze and that pretty much lead to Dean.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,I need a beer.,1
LORELAI,Hey.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Yes dear?,1
LORELAI,There's a lot more than an earlobe resemblance there.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Good. Hey, thanks for the door thing.",1
LORELAI,,1
DEAN,"You got it, you got the next one. Don't worry about it.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,So which is your Dean?,1
RORY,That's him over there.,1
LUKE,"Ok, we've got two outs.",1
RORY,And that's Luke.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Luke's the diner guy?,1
RORY,Yes. We eat there practically every day.,1
LUKE,Looks like we got out number three coming to the plate guys.,1
DEAN,I'd send your boys a little farther into the field Luke.,1
LUKE,Why? Will they have a better view of you whiffing?,1
DEAN,"You know, the only way I'm not hitting it, is if you don't have the strength to get it over the plate.",1
KIRK,The truth of the matter is that you can't pitch and you can't hit . So this'll be a terrific match up.,1
LUKE,Knock it off Kirk.,1
KIRK,A historic lack of action.,1
LUKE,Don't you have anything better to do with your Saturdays?,1
KIRK,"What can I say, I'm addicted to comedy. Half an hour they been playing and it's tied zero - zero. Hey if you ever take this show on the road I got a name for you, zero and zero. Dean Zero and Luke Zero - get it?",1
LUKE,Doesn't even resemble clever.,1
KIRK,I'm dumbing it down for you Alfalfa.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,How long do these games last?,1
RORY,Till they get tired. And then they say the first team to get a run wins.,1
KIRK,"Yeah, it's real professional down there. Hey Luke, does your husband play softball too?",1
LUKE,Alright that's it.,1
KIRK,Um...I'm getting a page. I've gotta go.,1
DEAN,Hey.,1
RORY,"Hey. Dean this is my dad. Dad, this is Dean.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,Dean.,1
DEAN,"Uh, nice to meet you.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,Same here.,1
DEAN,So do you live in the area?,1
CHRISTOPHERory,No I had some time so I rode my bike out from Berkley.,1
DEAN,Really? What do you got?,1
RORY,It's a 2000 Indian.,1
DEAN,I got an '86 Suzuki.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Nice!,1
DEAN,Yeah.,1
LUKE,Dean come on!,1
DEAN,I gotta go. I'll see you later. I was nice meeting you.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,So that was a Dean?,1
RORY,That was a Dean?,1
DEAN,"Hey, uh, next run wins alright?",1
LUKE,,1
LORELAI,Wow!,1
SOOKIE,Wow what?,1
LORELAI,Wow! I have never seen you two enjoy a pleasant moment together.,1
SOOKIE,Oh come on.,1
MICHELorelai,Oh you have seen us enjoy a pleasant moment!,1
LORELAI,"No, not ever.",1
MICHELorelai,Oh you are being absurd.,1
SOOKIE,"You have to admit, they are few and far between.",1
MICHELorelai,Through not fault of mine.,1
LORELAI,"I'm just saying, it's refreshing you know? It's not the usual  Grr' that's all.",1
SOOKIE,"Through no fault of yours? I'm sorry, but you're the one that's so...I don't know.",1
MICHELorelai,Oh I think you do otherwise you wouldn't have started saying it.,1
SOOKIE,Just yourself - caustic.,1
MICHELorelai,You mean obnoxious.,1
SOOKIE,You're words not mine.,1
MICHELorelai,Go to hell,1
LORELAI,"Oh no, I'm just saying it's refreshing to see you two just - oh yeah.",1
SOOKIE,You - get in here and tell me the happenings at home.,1
LORELAI,"I'm assuming you mean  did we get our toaster fixed' and no, it's been cold pop-tarts for a week, it's like a damn Dicken's novel.",1
SOOKIE,"I'm not talking about the toaster, I'm talking about the man.",1
LORELAI,Ah.,1
SOOKIE,So what's it like having him around the house all the time?,1
LORELAI,"Well it's, um, a little weird. We have fewer clean towels than usual.",1
SOOKIE,"Come on give me something. Tell me how you feel, I'm dying here.",1
LORELAI,"Honestly, I've been trying to figure out how this makes me feel since he asked me to take off my shirt the other day.",1
SOOKIE,Excuse me?,1
LORELAI,"No, it was a - kind of a  hello' kind of thing.",1
SOOKIE,Wow. He's smooth.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah. I mean I have not seen this man since last Christmas right. We hear from him maybe once a week - maybe. And then all of a sudden he's here in my town and Rory's running around all excited and he's sleeping on the couch and I'm thinking  should I be mad, should I send him to a hotel' but then he smiles and it's...Christopher.",1
SOOKIE,Here.,1
LORELAI,"I mean not matter how many years go by, no matter how long I don't see him for, whenever I do, it's always...Christopher. What do I do with this?",1
SOOKIE,Dunk. Go on.,1
LORELAI,"This man knows all my secrets. All of my bad girl moments happened with him - my worst fashion choices, my big hair days, the wearing of the Bonnie-Bell lipsmackers around my neck - it was all with Christopher.",1
SOOKIE,So do you think you two will -,1
LORELAI,No.,1
SOOKIE,Oh well that's convincing.,1
LORELAI,"I don't know I - he wants to be involved with Rory. He wants to spend more time with her,be a pal.",1
SOOKIE,It's about time.,1
LORELAI,Yeah that's good.,1
SOOKIE,Yes.,1
LORELAI,Yeah - if it's true.,1
SOOKIE,And if it's not?,1
LORELAI,,1
RORY,"This is the town flower shop. Um, over there is a good pizza place. That's the stationary store and that's Al's Pancake world.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,Good pancakes?,1
RORY,Oh he doesn't serve pancakes.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Ok.,1
RORY,"He switched to international cuisine a couple of years ago, and dropped the pancakes. He would've changed the name but he had already printed like a million napkins with the original name so he just kept it.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,What kind of international cuisine?,1
RORY,He kind of hops around. Last month it was his salute to Paraguay.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Anyone salute back?,1
RORY,,1
PATTY,Rory! Honey! How are you sweetie?,1
RORY,,1
PATTY,Your dad.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,,1
PATTY,"You're Rory's father, well, well, well. You know Christopher, we're all like Rory's parents around here and I'm one of her mothers. And since you're her father, well that would make us...a couple. A couple of what I don't know.",1
RORY,,1
PATTY,"Yes well, come back and see me.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,,1
PATTY,Bye.,1
TAYLORory,Well you must be Rory's father.,1

JACKSON,"Hey, hey Christopher! Jackson Melville.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,Hello.,1
JACKSON,"Boy I gotta tell you, did they get your description wrong.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,Really?,1
JACKSON,"Oh yeah, much more George Clooney than Brad Pitt. Hey Andrew.",1
ANDREW,Yup.,1
JACKSON,Don't you thin he's much more George Clooney than Brad Pitt?,1
ANDREW,I'm going with the Billy Crudup comparison myself.,1
JACKSON,Really?,1
ANDREW,Oh yeah.,1
JACKSON,I don't see it. Well maybe from the side. Hey do you mind?,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"What? Uh, no, not at all.",1
JACKSON,"Well there's a little Crudup in there. Huh, well it's nice to meet you, whoever you look like.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Nice to meet you. Ok, I'm kidnapping you and getting you out of here.",1
RORY,They all mean well.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Yeah, I'm sure all lunatics have the best intentions. Ok, so I hear you like books.",1
RORY,Why yes I do.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Well I would like you to pick something out and let my buy it for you.,1
RORY,Dad you don't have to buy me an ything.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Come on, what's the book of your dreams right now?",1
RORY,"Well that would definitely be the Compact Oxford English Dictionary, but dad -",1
CHRISTOPHERory,Excuse me - one Compact Oxford English Dictionary please.,1
ANDREW,Ok.,1
RORY,"Dad no, it costs a fortune.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,You need something to remember this visit by. ANDREW Here you go.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Holy mother. This is the monolith from 2001.,1
RORY,It has every word ever recorded in the English language plus origins and earliest usage.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"You sure you wouldn't rather have a car, they weigh about the same. Here you go.",1
RORY,This is so nice of you.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Yeah, well I've got a lot of things to make up for.",1
RORY,No you don't.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Yes I do.,1
ANDREW,"Uh, I'm sorry Christopher, your credit card has been rejected.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,Rejected? What are you talking about?,1
ANDREW,I could run it through again if you'd like.,1
RORY,Yes.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Uh, no. He doesn't need to run it throug hagain.",1
RORY,"Oh, ok.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,Could you maybe hold that for us? I'll come back tomorrow with another card.,1
ANDREW,"Sure Chris, no problem.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,Thanks. Come on. Now you'll really remember me.,1
RORY,I didn't want it that much anyways.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Hey, listen, don't tell your mom about this ok?",1
RORY,Ok.,1
JACKSON,,1
LUKE,So Rory was at the game today.,1
LORELAI,Oh yeah.,1
LUKE,Yeah she was with some guy.,1
LORELAI,Dean.,1
LUKE,"No, I know that punk. Some older guy.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, that would've been her dad.",1
LUKE,Really? So that's uh...,1
LORELAI,The guy who impregnated me with Rory - yes.,1
LUKE,"Oh, well, he did a good job.",1
LORELAI,Impregnating me w ith Rory?,1
LUKE,Now this has taken a very weird turn.,1
LORELAI,Yeah.,1
RORY,Hi.,1
LORELAI,"Oh hi, where were you?",1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well we saw Al's Paraguayan pancake house, we were stalked by several towns people and apparently I look like Billy Crudup.",1
LORELAI,You do not.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Take it up with Jackson.,1
LORELAI,"Ah, ah, ah, ah,. Hey, hey, hey, hey.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,Hello? Emily!,1
LORELAI,Emily?,1
CHRISTOPHERory,It's your mother.,1
RORY,Hi Grandma!,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Uh-huh Well actually I'm sitting here with your girls. Sure. She wants to speak to you.,1
LORELAI,Mm. Hi mom.,1
GRANDMA,"Lorelai, Christopher's in town!",1
LORELAI,What?! I didn't know! Although coincidently I'm sitting across an amazing Christopher hologram.,1
GRANDMA,Well I had this wonderful idea. Christopher's parents are in town too. You remember Straub and Francine don't you?,1
LORELAI,Ah yes - the Schnickelfritzes.,1
GRANDMA,The who?,1
LORELAI,The Hayden's.,1
GRANDMA,Well I called them up and invited them to dinner. They said they are free to join us all on Friday night.,1
LORELAI,Join us all?,1
GRANDMA,"Yes. You, Rory, Christopher, your father.",1
LORELAI,That's quite a gathering mom.,1
GRANDMA,Well I should say so. We haven't all been together since the two of you were children. And Straub and Francine haven't seen Rory since she was a baby.,1
LORELAI,Yeah I know but -,1
GRANDMA,It'll be like a wonderful reunion - all of us together again. I never thought it would happen.,1
LORELAI,,1
LORELAI,I've gotta see my parents.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,I've gotta see my parents.,1
RORY,"Ladies and gentlemen, the drama king and queen of Connecticut.",1
LORELAI,Hello? Anybody home?,1
GRANDMA,"Oh my God! You're here. Christopher, look at you!",1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Emily, as always perfect.",1
GRANDMA,"I am so glad to see you, I didn't hear the doorbell.",1
LORELAI,We didn't ring the doorbell.,1
GRANDMA,You let yourselves in?,1
LORELAI,"It's ok mom, look, not a r*pist among us.",1
RORY,Hi Grandma.,1
GRANDMA,You usually knock.,1
LORELAI,Not since you gave us a key.,1
GRANDMA,That is for emergencies.,1
LORELAI,"Well mom, I'm starving to death. Is that enough of an emergency for you?",1
GRANDMA,"Well, Richard's in the living room, come on in. He's dying to see you.",1
LORELAI,"It's a setup giving me that key. It's a key, it meant to be used, it's my parents house. Shut up.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,Sorry.,1
GRANDPA,Well here they are.,1
RORY,Hi Grandpa.,1
GRANDPA,Hello Rory. Lorelai. Christopher old boy how are you? My gosh it's good to see you!,1
CHRISTOPHERory,How are you Richard?,1
GRANDPA,"Well I'm better than most, not as good as some.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,And annoyed with all.,1
GRANDPA,"Aha! You speak the truth young man! I have made martini's. So Christopher, tell me about your business.",1
GRANDMA,"Oh Richard, let the poor boy relax.",1
GRANDPA,Well I simply want to find out how it's going.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,It's uh - it's going great Richard. I'm almost afraid to jinx it by telling you good it's going.,1
GRANDPA,"Oh, that is wonderful. I always knew you had it in you. You have a splash of greatness as my mother would say. You've always had that splash of greatness.",1
LORELAI,Mm. I'd like another splash of greatness if you don't mind.,1
GRANDMA,Oh Richard. Isn't Rory the spitting image of Christopher?,1
GRANDPA,I just hope you inherit your father's business sense also my dear.,1
GRANDMA,I know one thing for sure- you certainly have your father's musical talent.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, wait just a minute.",1
GRANDMA,What?,1
LORELAI,"Mom, neither of these two have any musical talent.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Hey, I play guitar.",1
LORELAI,You know the opening lick to  Smoke on the Water'.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,And I've since mastered the opening like to  Jumping Jack Flash'.,1
GRANDPA,I'm a...Chuck Berry man myself. Something wrong?,1
LORELAI,I would never have guessed that that last sentence would ever come out of your mouth.,1
GRANDPA,And why not?,1
LORELAI,Chuck Berry?,1
GRANDPA,"Yes, Chuck Berry. He was all the rage when I was in school.",1
LORELAI,So we're talking pre- My-ding-aling'?,1
GRANDPA,I believe I am.,1
GRANDMA,Do you rememb er when you two were what - ten and you put on that adorable show for us.,1
LORELAI,What show mom?,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Lucy, Schroeder, you laying on the coffee table.",1
LORELAI,"You pretending it was a piano. God, why is that remembered?",1
GRANDMA,Because it was such a wonderful production.,1
LORELAI,I don't know if it was a production mom. It was just one song.,1
CHRISTOPHERory, Suppertime'.,1
GRANDMA,Did you write that? That was really very good.,1
LORELAI,"Dad, that's from  You're a good man Charlie Brown' It's a famous musical.",1
GRANDPA,"Well I thought Christopher might have written it, he's a very talented man.",1
GRANDMA,That would be Straub and Francine.,1
LORELAI,"Ha, ha your turn.",1
GRANDPA,I haven't seen your parents in quite a number of years. We were practically inseparable for a while.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,I rememb er that.,1
RORY,This is weird. These are my other grandparents. I don't even know them. What do I call them?,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Call'em what I call'em - ass-,1
LORELAI,Chris...,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Sorry, my tie's too tight.",1
LORELAI,"Just, uh, call them Straub and Francine. Call them Mr and Mrs Hayden. Sir and Ma'am? Why don't you just avoid calling them anything.",1
GRANDPA,Look who's herre.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Hello mother, pop.",1
STRAUB,Christopher.,1
FRANCINE,"Christopher, hello.",1
LORELAI,"Mr and Mrs Hayden, long time no see.",1
FRANCINE,Lorelai. You look well.,1
LORELAI,I am thanks. You rememb er Rory. You haven't seen her in quite a while.,1
STRAUB,No we haven't.,1
FRANCINE,I think she was just beginning to speak in complete sentences.,1
LORELAI,So not for two years then. She's obviously been talking a long time so I was making a humorous commen t sometimes referred to as a  joke'.,1
STRAUB,I see you haven't changed Lorelai.,1
LORELAI,"No, not at all.",1
FRANCINE,"Rory, hello.",1
RORY,Hi.,1
LORELAI,Did you just curtsy?,1
RORY,Shut up.,1
LORELAI,"Sorry, milady.",1
GRANDPA,"Uh, Straub, Francine, how about a martini?",1
STRAUB,Please.,1
GRANDPA,"Well Straub, how is retirement treating you?",1
GRANDMA,Yes do tell us about the Bahamas.,1
STRAUB,You can get an entire island there for the cost of a decent house here.,1
GRANDPA,Really?,1
STRAUB,"How about you Richard, any thoughts of retirement crossing your mind?",1
GRANDMA,"Oh Straub, if only you could talk him into it. I've given up.",1
GRANDPA,We're very pleased about Christopher's business success out in California.,1
STRAUB,"Yes, it's taken a while but it seems to be finally coming together. Seems to be.",1
FRANCINE,"Christopher your tie, please.",1
RORY,"Straub and Fran - Mr. and Mrs. um...are you enjoying your time here, um...you...two?",1
CHRISTOPHERory,That she got from you.,1
STRAUB,How old are you young lady?,1
RORY,16.,1
STRAUB,Dangerous age for girls,1
FRANCINE,Straub.,1
GRANDMA,"Rory is a very special child - excellent student, very bright.",1
GRANDPA,"You should have a talk with her Straub, she could give you a run for your money.",1
STRAUB,Is that so?,1
GRANDMA,That's right.,1
STRAUB,Well I think my money's safe.,1
LORELAI,I hate president Bush.,1
STRAUB,What?,1
GRANDMA,Lorelai...,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Oh boy.,1
LORELAI,He's stupid and his face is too tiny for his head and I just want to toss him out.,1
STRAUB,That is the leader of our country young lady.,1
GRANDPA,Ignore her.,1
FRANCINE,"His face is too tiny for his head, what kind of thing is that to say?",1
STRAUB,I see your daughter is just as out of control as ever.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Pop please. Let's try and keep it civil.,1
STRAUB,"Tell me Lorelai, what have you been doing with your life anyway, besides hating successful businessmen. I'm just curious.",1
GRANDMA,Why don't we all go into the dining room?,1
LORELAI,"Well uh, Straub, I run an inn near Stars Hollow.",1
STRAUB,Really?,1
LORELAI,Yes really.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Dad come on.,1
STRAUB,Nice to see you found your calling.,1
GRANDMA,Dinner is ready.,1
FRANCINE,Christopher your tie.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Mom please.,1
STRAUB,And is your life everything you hoped it would be?,1
LORELAI,Yes it is.,1
STRAUB,Because it seems to me you might not want to take such a haughty tone when you announce to the world that you work in a hotel.,1
LORELAI,Well there's nothing wrong with where I work.,1
FRANCINE,Straub please. I'm getting a headache.,1
GRANDMA,"Come on Richard, lead us into the dining room, now.",1
STRAUB,"If you had attended a university as your parents had planned and as we planned in vain for Christopher, you might have aspired to something more than a blue collared position.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,Don't do this.,1
STRAUB,And I wouldn't give a damn about you derailing your life if you hadn't swept my son along with you.,1
LORELAI,"Honey go into the next room. Go, go.",1
GRANDPA,"I'm going to have to echo Christopher's call for civility here. A mutual mistake was make many years ago by these two, but they have come a long way since.",1
STRAUB,"A mutual mistake Richard? This whole evening is ridiculous. We're supposed to sit here like one big happy family and pretend that the damage that was done is over, gone? I don't care about how good a student you say that girl is...",1
LORELAI,Hey!,1
STRAUB,"Our son was bound for Princeton. Every Hayden male attended Princeton including myself, but it all stopped with Christopher. It's a humiliation we've had to live with every day, all because you seduced him into ruining his life. She had that baby and ended his future.",1
GRANDPA,You recant that Straub!,1
STRAUB,You're spilling my drink.,1
GRANDPA,You owe my daughter an apology.,1
STRAUB,"An apology, that's rich.",1
GRANDPA,How dare you?! How dare you?!,1
GRANDMA,Richard what are you doing?,1
GRANDPA,How dare you come in to my house and insult my daughter!,1
STRAUB,Let go of me!,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Whoa, whoa, what is going on here?",1
GRANDPA,"Shame on you Straub, shame on you for opening all this up again.",1
STRAUB,Get your purse Francine.,1
GRANDPA,My daughter is very successful at what she does.,1
STRAUB,We're leaving.,1
GRANDPA,You're not leaving. I'm kicking you out.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,And you brought up Bush because?,1
LORELAI,It seemed like a good idea at the time. Wow.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Yeah.,1
LORELAI,I feel...16.,1
LORELAI,Dad? Dad...can I get you something to eat?,1
GRANDPA,I'm not hungry.,1
LORELAI,"Ok. Well look, thank you.",1
GRANDPA,Thank me? For what?,1
LORELAI,"Well for what you did in there. I'm...I'm just unbelievably touched and grateful for what you said to him, for defending me like that. I know it was hard for you because, well...but thank you.",1
GRANDPA,Why do you think I did it?,1
LORELAI,What?,1
GRANDPA,Why do you think I did it?,1
LORELAI,"I don't know. Um, out of protectiveness I guess.",1
GRANDPA,You don't need to be protected Lorelai. You've made it very clear that you can look after yourself and that you need nothing from anyone.,1
LORELAI,Mm. That's not...,1
GRANDPA,A memb er of my family was being att*cked. The very Gilmore name was being att*cked. I will not stand for that not under any circumstances.,1
LORELAI,"Ok, well it doesn't really matter why you did it.",1
GRANDPA,Yes it does matter why I did it! It matters greatly! Lorelai what are you going to take away from this? That everything that happened in the past is suddenly fine because I defended you?,1
LORELAI,No.,1
GRANDMA,That the hell that you put your mother and I through for the past 16 years is suddenly washed away? Well it's not.,1
LORELAI,We've all been through hell dad.,1
GRANDPA,"I had to tell my friends, my colleagues, that my only daughter, the brightest in her class, was pregnant and was leaving school.",1
LORELAI,That must have been devastating.,1
GRANDPA,And then you run away and treat us like lepers. Your mother couldn't get out of bed for a month. Did you know that? Did you?,1
LORELAI,No.,1
GRANDPA,We did nothing to deserve that. Nothing to earn that!,1
LORELAI,"I get it. I'm horrible. So why don't you disown me and adopt Christopher, you love him.",1
GRANDPA,Don't be a martyr Lorelai. And don't be naïve. Do you think I love the boy who got my daughter pregnant? I wanted to k*ll him! I would have too with my bare hands. But there's a proper procedure to be followed in a situation like this.,1
LORELAI,Marriage.,1
GRANDPA,"Christopher was willing to follow the procedure we laid out, you weren't.",1
LORELAI,What about what I wanted Dad? Didn't that matter to you at all?,1
GRANDPA,Sometimes one has to sacrifice something in order to do what is right.,1
LORELAI,"I feel indescribably sad for you right now, dad.",1
GRANDPA,Well save your emotions Lorelai. I've had my fill of them tonight.,1
LORELAI,"So, um, we just end it here. Nothing...resolved?",1
GRANDPA,I'm tired.,1
LORELAI,Ok. Ok,1
GRANDMA,There you are. I was wondering where you went.,1
RORY,I'm sorry.,1
GRANDMA,"No, it's nothing to be sorry about. Can I get you something?",1
RORY,I'm fine.,1
GRANDMA,Oh that's hardly dinner. Well that was quite a bit of excitement tonight.,1
RORY,Oh yeah.,1
GRANDMA,Not the good kind.,1
RORY,Nope.,1
GRANDMA,None of this means anything Rory.,1
RORY,Oh I know.,1
GRANDMA,"Straub is actually a good man. Very smart. He was one of the top lawyers in his field - a very arcane aspect of International law. And he's always been so active in his community. His charity work has never diminished over the years. Oh let's face it - he's a big ass. Rory, I know you heard a lot of talk about various disappointments this evening and I know you've heard a lot of talk about it in the past. But I want to make this very clear - you, young lady, your person and your existance have never ever been - not even for a second -included in that list. Do you understand me?",1
RORY,"Yeah, I do.",1
GRANDMA,Good now eat up.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,You look great,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, well, I look the way I feel wiseguy.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,That was...that was a memorable evening.,1
LORELAI,"Oh yes, it was beautiful in there. We should commemorate it with an oil painting or a severed head or something.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,Next time w e get this group together we're gonna have to frisk for weapons.,1
LORELAI,Hand out gags.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Employ six individual cones of silence Boy the old balcony is still the same is n't it?,1
LORELAI,In all it's beautiful away-from-them-ness.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Perfect hide-out - totally private. We spent a lot of time out here.,1
LORELAI,"Sneaking dad's telescope, scanning the sky for alien ships.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,Never found any.,1
LORELAI,"Huh. And then when we were older, scanning the neighbors houses for naked people.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,Found a couple of those.,1
LORELAI,Mrs. Dominski undulating in her big fat underalls is forever carved into my brain.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,And in mine. here's to Mrs. Dominski's underalls.,1
LORELAI,"Aw, you're holding out on me.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Take it. And in an effort to further chronicle this balcony's history, we are now in the immed iate vicinity of the spot upon which was Rory's initial eminations.",1
LORELAI,Yes we are. Here's to Rory.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,The bright spot in all the darkness.,1
LORELAI,And now.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"You know even if you hadn't gotten pregnant and everything had gone as planned, I still never would have make it through Princeton.",1
LORELAI,Oh I don't believe that.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Yeah, well that's why you're you and I'm not.",1
LORELAI,"Wow. Wow, wow, wow.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,You wigged?,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, yeah I'm a little wigged.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,Why?,1
LORELAI,Why? Are you kidding me? Chris this is the next to last thing I thought would ever happen tonight. The last thing being a holy saint guy riding down on a flaming chariot from heaven to announce Armageddon.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,And Hartford is the place he chooses to make his announcement? I don't think so.,1
LORELAI,Christopher.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Ok, yes, it was unexpected but it was great.",1
LORELAI,Oh God! Oh I can't believe this.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Ok fine. You know what? We should go.,1
LORELAI,Yeah we should go like 30 minutes ago.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,I'm sorry.,1
LORELAI,,1
RORY,So where were you guys?,1
LORELAI,Nowhere.,1
RORY,Where's nowhere?,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Where we were.,1
LORELAI,Mm-hmm.,1
RORY,,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Night you.,1
RORY,Good night dad.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Good night Lor.,1
LORELAI,"Good night, yeah, uh, have a really, really good night.",1
RORY,You got some dirt or some schmuts on your -,1
LORELAI,Hmm?,1
RORY,Where did you -,1
LORELAI,"I don't - it's been a long night so um, there's just been a lot of schmutsing going on.",1
RORY,Ok.,1
LORELAI,Come on We haven't really had a chance to talk.,1
RORY,About the schmutsing?,1
LORELAI,"No, about all the warm and fuzzy family moments that went on tonight. Are you ok?",1
RORY,Yeah.,1
LORELAI,You know all those crazy people saying those horrible things were directing them at me not you.,1
RORY,They were directing them to you because you had me.,1
LORELAI,"No, they were directing them at me because I screwed up their big  Citizen Kane' plans. That's all.",1
RORY,They don't even want to know me do they?,1
LORELAI,That is not true. They are just so full of anger and stupid pride that stands in the way of them realizing how much they want to know you.,1
RORY,Yeah.,1
LORELAI,Their loss and it's a pretty big one.,1
RORY,I'm going to bed now.,1
LORELAI,Hey. No regrets - from me o r your dad.,1
RORY,Yeah?,1
LORELAI,"Oh, I mean no regrets about you. There's a misspelled tattoo incident that I'm sure he'd like to erase from his bio - but you that's a no brainer.",1
RORY,Where does dad have a misspelled tattoo?,1
LORELAI,"Ah, ah, another story for another time, possibly before your first trip to Mazatlan. Good night babe.",1
RORY,Good night mom.,1
LORELAI,Ugh.,1
LORELAI,,1
LORELAI,I feel horrible.,1
LUKE,Don't.,1
LORELAI,I stood you up and I didn't even call.,1
LUKE,It's ok.,1
LORELAI,I'm a rat. We had a date and I stood you up.,1
LUKE,"It wasn't a date, it was just a paint.",1
LORELAI,"I'm a rat, I need cheese.",1
LUKE,Forget it.,1
LORELAI,"Hey, hey, let's reschedule.",1
LUKE,"You know, I really didn't even want to do it in the first place.",1
LORELAI,"No, no come on, don't change your mind. We could do it tonight or - or right now.",1
LUKE,Was it an emergency?,1
LORELAI,Yes. You would not believe what happened. I slipped and I busted my - it wasn't an emergency. It was just me being a rat.,1
LUKE,Something came up?,1
LORELAI,Yeah.,1
LUKE,Something...someone.,1
LORELAI,Luke.,1
LUKE,Am I right?,1
LORELAI,I'm sorry.,1
LUKE,"Yeah, ok. Well I'm late.",1
LORELAI,,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Where were you?,1
LORELAI,Fruitlessly trying to rectify a ratty transgression.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Oh. You want some coffee?,1
LORELAI,No.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,What?,1
LORELAI,What?,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well I know you well enough to know that when you say no to coffee, especially inthe morning, all is not right in Whoville.",1
LORELAI,Very astute.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,So...last night.,1
LORELAI,"Ah, last night was Chernobyl and the Hindenburg combined.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Right, just checking.",1
LORELAI,My father almost hit someone. My father has probably only hit another man in college wearing boxing gloves and one of those Fred Mertz golden gloves pullover sweaters.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Fred Mertz?,1
LORELAI, I Love Lucy' - Fred Mertz.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Landlord to Ricki, husband to Ethel, I know. It's just a weird reference.",1
LORELAI,"Hello, pajamas.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,Right. Continue.,1
LORELAI,"My father had a meltdown, first with your father...",1
CHRISTOPHERory,He was asking for it.,1
LORELAI,...and then with me. And then you and me - oh boy.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Don't say it like that.,1
LORELAI,Stupid. Dumb.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Much better.,1
LORELAI,"And to top off the whole fabulous fiasco, I stood up a friend of mine, who was counting on me an d, and he just stood there looking hurt with the paint and the chairs and it hurt me. And it's not your fault but in this parade of stupid and dumb, I am the one twirling the flaming baton.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,Lor?,1
LORELAI,What?,1
CHRISTOPHERory,I want to marry you.,1
LORELAI,And the hits just keep on coming.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Just think about it. Think about it before you make a rash -,1
LORELAI,You are out of your mind. You are completely insane. You have flipped your lid. Charlie Manson is freaked out by you right now!,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Come on, we're already a family.",1
LORELAI,Who? Who is a family?!,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Us! You, me an d Rory!",1
LORELAI,You don't even know what a family is.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,It's people living together.,1
LORELAI,"No. It's a big commit ment, it's responsibility, it's hard work. It's coming home at the same time to the same place every day.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Ok, so what do you want, financial statements? I can be a family man, I'm responsible.",1
LORELAI,"Honey, you can't even buy a book without having your credit card declined.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Oh man, I told Rory not to rat me out. I can't believe she did that.",1
LORELAI,She didn't. Andrew from the bookstore called and Jackson and the UPS guy and ooh it was the lead story on the Stars Hollow web page. And then I asked Rory and she very reluctantly confirmed it.  Rat me out' what are you - 16?,1
CHRISTOPHERory,I'm sorry.,1
LORELAI,And what are you doing telling my daughter to lie to me anyway?,1
CHRISTOPHERory,She's my daughter too.,1
LORELAI,More like your playmate.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"You know I don't deserve that, I'm as mature as you.",1
LORELAI,What? The offspring is your favorite band.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,So? You're into Metallica.,1
LORELAI,Well Metallica is way more substantial than The Offspring.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Here we go, it's the same Black Sabbath riff all over again.",1
LORELAI,Oh! The Offspring have like one chord compression. They use it over and over. They just popped on new words and called it a single and I don't want to talk about this anymore!,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Look, I'm the immat ure one, I'm the irresponsible one, I'm was the one who was willing to get married when you got pregnant.",1
LORELAI,"We were too young, we wouldn't have made it, you know that.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,Well we're not too young now.,1
LORELAI,Ok. Now I need some coffee.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,What about last night. What did our having sex mean to you?,1
LORELAI,It meant that Jose Cuervo still has amazing magical powers.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,You're funny.,1
LORELAI,We can't get married Christopher. We don't know each other as adults.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,So let's get married and get to know each other as adults.,1
LORELAI,"Well, that's very Fiddler on the Roof of you.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Ok, fine. Let's get to know each other right now. What do you want to know?",1
LORELAI,How is your business really doing?,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Lorelai.,1
LORELAI,I knew it.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Look, I was going to tell you if it didn't pick up soon. I swear.",1
LORELAI,"And you just sat there last night, just smiling and nodding while my dad and your dad went on and on about Christopher and his great big business success in California.",1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Yeah, I didn't want to upset anybody. I wanted last night to be nice.",1
LORELAI,Oh well it was.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Oh and it would have been much better if I had announced at the table  Hey on top of everything else you're upset about, I just wanted to add that I'm the biggest loser in the world'. Would that have been festive?",1
LORELAI,You're not a loser.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Please.,1
LORELAI,You're a liar but not a loser.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Thank you.,1
LORELAI,You're welcome.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,"Come on ,we're arguing like an old married couple. Doesn't that show potential?",1
LORELAI,"Oh Christopher, I swear to God...",1
CHRISTOPHERory,"I've been looking for the one Lor, that elusive soul mate - I really have, I just believe it's you, it's always been you.",1
LORELAI,Chris come on.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Rory might be my only child.,1
LORELAI,That's not true. If Tony Randall can crank one out in his seventies you have decades left to spawn.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,No. I don't know how much I miss Rory until I see her like this. It's...it's easier staying away.,1
LORELAI,No. Don't stay away. Don't. Rory needs her dad.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,Or her pal right?,1
LORELAI,I think she'd take a combo.,1
RORY,So call us when you get home.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,I will.,1
RORY,And call more.,1
CHRISTOPHERory,I will. See ya.,1
RORY,Dad wants to know if you'll reconsider.,1
RORY,She says  Nope. Offspring sucks and Metallica rules.',1
CHRISTOPHERory,Fair enough.,1
LORELAI,Drive safe.,1
RORY,He wanted you to marry him didn't he?,1
LORELAI,Spy.,1
RORY,You know crazier things have happened.,1
LORELAI,You mean crazier than having your mom and dad married?,1
RORY,Yes.,1
LORELAI,I don't think they have.,1
RORY,What? Why is that so crazy?,1
LORELAI,Because it is. Because he wants things he is not ready for.,1
RORY,How do you know?,1
LORELAI,I know. I know him so well. You have no idea.,1
RORY,Maybe he can change.,1
LORELAI,Rory.,1
RORY,"Maybe it's different. He did come here this time, he's never done that before.",1
LORELAI,"Hey, stop.",1
RORY,Why?,1
LORELAI,Because I don't want you to get yourself all worked up over this.,1
RORY,He loves you.,1
LORELAI,He does love me.,1
RORY,Do you love him?,1
LORELAI,Honey come on.,1
RORY,Answer me.,1
LORELAI,Honestly?,1
RORY,Yes.,1
LORELAI,I will probably always love him.,1
RORY,Ok so?,1
LORELAI,"But that doesn't change the fact that he still has a long way to go before he is ready to take us on full time. I mean you are a handful missy. And while I am pure joy and sunshine every waking hour, I still have my own set of needs that - that must be met. It just wasn't right babe. You have to trust me on that. Mm? Talk please.",1
RORY,I still think there was a little something different.,1
LORELAI,Maybe you're right.,1
RORY,Really?,1
LORELAI,It would be nice.,1
RORY,Yeah it would,1
LORELAI,"I'll tell you what, uh, let's not put all the blankets away just yet.",1
RORY,Really?,1
LORELAI,,1
LUKE,What the -,1
LORELAI,Taa-daa!,1
LUKE,How'd you get in here?,1
LORELAI,You're bread guy let me in .,1
LUKE,I'm switching bread guys.,1
LORELAI,What do you think?,1
LUKE,I think you shouldn't break and enter.,1
LORELAI,,1
LUKE,Well I gotta admit - it looks pretty good.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, I knew you'd like it.",1
LUKE,Thanks.,1
LORELAI,Anytime. It's fun.,1
LUKE,"So, uh, where's the guy?",1
LORELAI,Oh he's gone.,1
LUKE,"Oh, too bad.",1
LORELAI,We'll be fine. Luke?,1
LUKE,Yeah?,1
LORELAI,"Um, can I make one more suggestion?",1
LUKE,No.,1
LORELAI,Curtains?,1
LUKE,No.,1
LORELAI,Manly curtains.,1
LUKE,Oxymoron.,1
LORELAI,What did you call me?,1
LUKE,No curtains.,1
LORELAI,Aw come on. You gotta give a little. How about a tablecloth?,1

PATTY,"This, boys and girls, is the story of true love. A beautiful girl from one county; a handsome boy from another. They meet and they fall in love. Separated by distance and by parents who did not approve of the union, the young couple dreamed of a day that they could be together. They wrote each other beautiful letters. Letters of longing and passion. Letters full of promises and plans for the future. Soon the separation proved too much for either one of them to bear. So, one night, cold and black with no light to guide them, they both snuck out of their homes and ran away as fast as they could. It was so dark out that they were both soon lost and it seemed as if they would never find each other. Finally, the girl dropped to her knees, tears streaming down her lovely face. 'Oh, my love. Where are you? How will I find you?' Suddenly, a band of stars appeared in the sky. These stars shone so brightly they lit up the entire countryside. The girl jumped to her feet and followed the path of the stars until finally she found herself standing right where the town gazebo is today. And there waiting for her was her one true love, who had also been led here by the blanket of friendly stars. And that, my friends, is the story of how Stars Hollow came to be, and why we celebrate that fateful night every year at about this time. Now, we still have a little time left in our story hour. Who wants to hear about the time I danced in a cage for Tito Puente?",1

PATTY,,1
RORY,So?,1
DEAN,It's depressing.,1
Posted,03/20/01 14:43,1
RORY,It's beautiful.,1
DEAN,She throws herself under a train.,1
RORY,But I bet she looked great doing it.,1
DEAN,I don't know. I think maybe Tolstoy's just a little over my head.,1
RORY,"No, that's not true. Tolstoy wrote for the masses, the common man. It's completely untrue that you have to be some kind of genius to read his stuff.",1
DEAN,Yeah but ,1
RORY,Now I know it's big. . .,1
DEAN,Very big.,1
RORY,And long. . .,1
DEAN,"Very, very long",1
RORY,"And many of the Russian names tend be spelled very similar, making it confusing ",1
DEAN,Every single person's name en ds with 'ski'. Now how is that possible?,1
RORY,But it's one of my favorite books. And I know that if you just give it a try you...,1
DEAN,All right. I'll try again.,1
RORY,Really?,1
DEAN,Yeah.,1
RORY,You won't be sorry.,1
DEAN,Coffee?,1
RORY,Please.,1
DEAN,"Man, I thought Christmas was a big deal around here.",1
RORY,"Well, this is a town that likes the celebrating. Last year we had a month long carnival when we finally got off the septic t*nk system.",1
DEAN,A month long? You're kidding.,1
RORY,No. There were rides and a petting zoo and balloon animals and a freak show.,1
DEAN,"Uh huh. Okay, you almost had me going there for a second.",1
RORY,Well we did have a ribbon cutting ceremony.,1
DEAN,So what are you doing Friday night?,1
RORY,"Well, I've got the usual Friday night grandparents' dinner. But I thought maybe if we get back early enough you and I should go watch the bonfire together. I mean, it's kind of corny, but it'sreally pretty. And they sell star-shaped hot dogs.",1
DEAN,How about if you get out of dinner at your grandparents' this week?,1
RORY,I don't think so.,1
DEAN,"Well, what if it's for a really special occasion?",1
RORY,"Well, that special occasion better include my being relocated to a plastic bubble if my grandmother's gonna let me out of dinner.",1
DEAN,There must be some other excuse that you could use.,1
RORY,Like what?,1
DEAN,Like it's your three-month anniversary with your boyfriend.,1
RORY,It is?,1
DEAN,"Yeah. Three months from your birthday. I mean, that's when I gave you the bracelet and that's when I figured this whole thing kinda started.",1
RORY,Wow. Three months.,1
DEAN,"Actually, technically your birthday was on a Saturday, so really it should be Saturday, but I work Saturday and I planned out this whole big thing so I thought maybe we could do it on Friday.",1
RORY,What whole big thing?,1
DEAN,Just this once. Miss dinner. Please. Don't make me throw myself under a train.,1
RORY,I'll see what I can do.,1
DEAN,Thank you.,1
RORY,You're welcome. It's our three-month anniversary.,1
DEAN,Yeah it is.,1
RORY,I feel kind of stupid that I didn't even know about this.,1
DEAN,That's quite all right.,1
RORY,"I mean, I feel really bad that I missed our two-month anniversary.",1
DEAN,Quite all right too.,1
RORY,How was it?,1
DEAN,Pretty good.,1
RORY,,1
RORY,"No, put that away.",1
LORELAI,I wanna cook.,1
RORY,You can make soup.,1
LORELAI,"No. I wanna really cook like on the Food Channel. I wanna sauté thing and chop things and do the BAM, and I wanna arrange things on a plate so they look like a pretty little hat. I wanna be the Iron Chef!",1
RORY,Fine.,1
LORELAI,Really?,1
RORY,"Yeah, I'll help.",1
Lorelai,Okay. I need a pan.,1
Rory,And a fire extinguisher.,1
Lorelai,"Funny, funny girl. Now, if I had only bought some hamburger.",1
Rory,You didn't buy hamburger?,1
Lorelai,Yes I bought hamburger. I just like saying things like that so you look at me like I'm crazy.,1
Rory,"So, tell me, why the sudden need to be domestic?",1
Lorelai,"Ah, I don't know. I'm in like a funky mood.",1
Rory,Why?,1
Lorelai,"Too many stars, too much love, it makes me cranky.",1
Rory,I take it you haven't heard from Mr. Medina?,1
Lorelai,"Hmm, no. I haven't.",1
Rory,Maybe that's why you're cranky.,1
Lorelai,"Okay, new subject please.",1
Rory,"You know, you have a phone also.",1
Lorelai,How's it coming with that pan?,1
Rory,"Cleopatra, queen of denial.",1
Lorelai,"The pan, Chucky. Please.",1
Rory,Okay fine. New topic.,1
Lorelai,Thank you.,1
Rory,I have this huge favor to ask you.,1
Lorelai,"Oh, something I can hold over your head. Let's hear it.",1
Rory,Friday night is Dean's and my three-month anniversary.,1
Lorelai,Three months? Wow.,1
Rory,And Dean apparently has some big fancy evening planned for us.,1
Lorelai,Very classy of him.,1
Rory,"Yes it is. But for me to actually partake of the foresaid fancy evening, I have to get out of Friday night dinner.",1
Lorelai,Ah.,1
Rory,Yeah.,1
Lorelai,Good luck with that.,1
Rory,Mom!,1
Lorelai,Do you know how much Emily Gilmore will not care about your three-month anniversary?,1
Rory,I was thinking you could talk to her.,1
Lorelai,"If there was a runoff between what Emily Gilmore would care about less, a two-for-one toilet paper sale at Costco or your three month anniversary, your anniversary would win, hands down.",1
Rory,So you're not even gonna try to help me?,1
Lorelai,"Oh no, I'm gonna try to help you, because I care. Emily Gilmore, however. .",1
Rory,Phone please.,1
Lorelai,Okay.,1
Rory,What?,1
Lorelai,"Nothing. It's just, 'Oh, hey Mom, uh, Rory and Dean are having their three month anniversary on Friday.' 'Really Lorelai? Why that's wonderful. I'm thrilled.'",1
Rory,Stop.,1
Lorelai,"'Three months. Well, woohoo. Hold on, I'm going to cartwheel.'",1
Rory,Forget it.,1
Lorelai,"Oh, no wait. She's telling my dad now. Why, I think they're cabbage patching.",1
Rory,That's it. Find your own pan.,1
EMILY,Hello?,1
Lorelai,Mom?,1
EMILY,Lorelai?,1
Lorelai,"Uh, yes, hi.",1
EMILY,Hello.,1
Lorelai,Hi. How are you doing?,1
EMILY,I'm doing fine.,1
Lorelai,That's good.,1
EMILY,I'm pleased.,1
Lorelai,How's Dad?,1
EMILY,What do you want Lorelai?,1
Lorelai,"Um, I was just calling to say hello.",1
EMILY,And now you have.,1
Lorelai,"Okay, good.",1
EMILY,Was there anything else that you wanted to add to that hello?,1
Lorelai,"Well, as a matter of fact, there is.",1
EMILY,Ah ha.,1
Lorelai,"Um, you know Rory.",1
EMILY,"Yes, I believe I do.",1
Lorelai,She wanted to say hello too.,1
EMILY,"Lorelai, I'm late for a meet ing. I'd love to know why.",1
Lorelai,"Mom, just hear me out, okay, and don't say anything. Um, see Friday night is Rory and Dean's three-month anniversary, and while that might not seem like a very big deal to you, it is to them. And I'm gonna ask you to do something you are so not gonna wanna do. But I am begging you to look at it from her point of view and maybe, just maybe let her, just this once, not come to dinner on Friday.",1
EMILY,All right.,1
Lorelai,What?,1
EMILY,"Since this is a special occasion, I suppose it would be fine if Rory missed dinner on Friday.",1
Lorelai,It would?,1
EMILY,Yes,1
Rory,Mom?,1
Lorelai,Are you sure?,1
EMILY,I believe I am.,1
Lorelai,No arguments?,1
EMILY,No.,1
Lorelai,"Well, she wont be there.",1
EMILY,I understand.,1
Lorelai,At all.,1
EMILY,I heard.,1
Lorelai,All night long.,1
EMILY,I assumed as much.,1
Lorelai,Okay.,1
EMILY,Okay.,1
Lorelai,All right.,1
EMILY,Anything else?,1
Lorelai,"Uh, you know, she's gonna need some help getting ready for the big night Mom, so I should probably. ",1

LUKE,But there's no particular reason for this mood?,1
LORELAI,No.,1
LUKE,Uh huh.,1
LORELAI,You don't believe me?,1

LUKE,,1
PATTY,"Oh, no thank you, sweetheart.",1
LORELAI,I don't know what is wrong with me. This is a beautiful festival. People should be enjoying it.,1
LUKE,"It's a crazy festival based on a nutty myth about two lunatics, who in all probability did not even exist. And even if they did, probably dropped dead of diphtheria before age 24. The town of Stars Hollow probably got its name from the local dance hall prost*tute. Two rich drunk guys who made up the story to make it look good on a poster.",1
LORELAI,"You are full of hate and loathing, and I gotta tell you, I love it!",1
LUKE,"Oh, it's so good to have somebody share this hate with.",1
LORELAI,My pleasure.,1

RACHELorelai,"Actually, though very similar to both the Congo and Philadelphia, I was in the Mideast.",1
LUKE,Oh. Guess that postcard must've gotten lost.,1
RACHELorelai,"Yeah, yeah, well things pretty crazy over there, not a lot of writing time. But I finished up my assignment, and I flew back to Chicago and I was walking through O'Hare, and I look up and there's a plane leaving for Hartford in like 20 minutes, and all of a sudden, I'm on it.",1
LUKE,Nice story.,1
RACHELorelai,I should have called.,1
LUKE,No. You it's fine.,1

LUKE,"Sorry, she runs it.",1
RACHELorelai,"Wow, I love that place.",1
LORELAI,Oh!,1
RACHELorelai,That must be a pretty big job.,1
LORELAI,"It is! It's crazy. There's always something happening. Like, we just put these coffee makers in all the rooms, but only half of them work. They just like shake and gurgle, like they're having some kind of a fit. Why were you in the Mideast?",1
RACHELorelai,"I was doing a photo story, on how Palestinian and Israeli families have been affected by the v*olence.",1
LORELAI,"Uh huh, well, so you understand about the job pressure.",1
RACHELorelai,Yeah.,1
LORELAI,I'm gonna go.,1
RACHELorelai,"Please, don't let me drive you away.",1
LORELAI,"That's okay, you're not. I have to go sit in a closet or something. So, it was really nice to meet you.",1
RACHELorelai,"Yeah, you too.",1
LORELAI,"Okay, bye.",1
RACHELorelai,So. . .hi.,1
LUKE,,1
LORELAI,"'Oh, we got new coffee makers.' Ugh! What was I thinking?",1
RORY,"Well, you spent a lot of time picking out those coffee makers.",1
Lorelai,"Oh yeah, I'm Mrs. Coffee.",1
Rory,"Ow! Okay, I'm still attached to the head.",1
Lorelai,"Okay, sorry. I'm a little worked up.",1
Rory,"Mom, it just Luke's ex-girlfriend.",1
Lorelai,I know. I just hate that I made myself look so stupid in front of ,1
Rory,Luke?,1
Lorelai,"No, Rachel. She was standing there, fresh off a plane, and she had no plane hair at all might I add.",1
Rory,And what exactly is plane hair?,1
Lorelai,"You know, it's all big and all bah.",1
Rory,Got it.,1
Lorelai,"And he's staring at her like she's Miss September and she's looking at him like he's Johnny Depp, and I was just babbling like a moron, what is wrong with me?!",1
Rory,"Ow! Ow! Okay, you are now officially off hair duty.",1
Lorelai,"Aw, I'm sorry. I just ",1
Rory,"No, it's okay. I just think it's a little early for Dean to see me completely bald.",1
Lorelai,"Right, that's more a six-month thing.",1
Rory,So what's going on with you?,1
Lorelai,"I don't know. It's just all this love in the air, you know. I miss Max. There's just been so much going on with your Dad coming home an d family stuff and your constant existence ",1
Rory,Thanks for the love.,1
Lorelai,Any time. So I haven't had a lot of time to focus on it and I miss Max.,1
Rory,I know.,1
Lorelai,I had a dream about him the other night.,1
Rory,Really? Dirty?,1
Lorelai,"No, absolutely not. And when you're 21, I'll tell you the real answer. Anyway, it's put me in a funk since then.",1
Rory,I'm sorry.,1
Lorelai,"Me too. We could talk about me for years, and believe me, we will. But let's focus on you, the lady of the evening. No hooker reference intended.",1
Rory,Glad to hear it.,1
Lorelai,"Now, what are you gonna wear with that?",1
Rory,"Um, you tell me.",1
Lorelai,"Uh, where is he taking you?",1
Rory,Why?,1
Lorelai,"Well, you don't want to clash with the decor. A lady plans ahead.",1
Rory,"Well, if you must know, he's taking me to Andoloro's.",1
Lorelai,"Oh, well isn't that romantic?",1
Rory,I know!,1
Lorelai,"Wow, it's gonna be just like Lady and the Tramp. You'll share a plate of spaghetti, but it'll just be one long strand, but you won't realize it until you accidentally meet in the middle. And then, he'll push a meatball towards you with his nose, and you'll push it back with your nose, and then you'll bring the meatball home an d you'll save it in the refrigerator for years and. . .",1
Rory,Mom?,1
Lorelai,"Uh, neither. Just wear your coat.",1
Rory,Okay.,1
Lorelai,But your flower's just a little smushed.,1
LANE,Rory?,1
Lorelai,"There you go, you're all set.",1
LANE,Is anyone here?,1
Rory,You all right?,1
Lorelai,"Oh yeah, you look beautiful. Go.",1
RORY,Lane?,1
LANE,,1
LANE,I just can't believe it!,1
RORY,I know!,1
LANE,"I mean, three months, that's like one sixty-fourth of your life!",1
Rory,I know!,1
LANE,"I have to stop hanging out with you. I mean, you're just making my life seem too pathetic.",1
LORELAI,Join the club.,1
Rory,Are you going to the festival? 'Cause maybe we could meet you there later.,1
LANE,"Oh yeah, that would be romantic.",1
Rory,Lane.,1
LANE,"Yes, I'm going to the festival. And would you like to know why?",1
Lorelai,Uh oh!,1
LANE,My mother has once again set me up.,1
Rory,Another future doctor?,1
LANE,A future chiropractor. I think she's losing confidence in my prospects.,1
Rory,Maybe he'll be nice.,1
LANE,"Oh, it's not just him. We're going with his parents, his grandparents, two sisters, three brothers and at least one maiden aunt.",1
Rory,That's Dean.,1
LANE,"Rememb er, you have to tell me ev erything.",1
Rory,Okay. You too.,1
LANE,"Oh yeah. After the walking, the silence, the sitting and the 'buh bye', that's when the fun will begin.",1
Rory,I wanna know anyhow. Bye Mom.,1
Lorelai,"Bye honey, have fun.",1
Rory,Okay.,1
Lorelai,Don't forget the meatball.,1
LANE,The meatball?,1
Lorelai,It's a mother-daughter thing.,1
LANE,"So, think I can hang out with you for awhile?",1
Lorelai,"Oh, uh, not unless you wanna go to Hartford. Besides didn't anyone ever tell you, it's not polite to keep fifteen prospective Korean in-laws waiting.",1
LANE,You can run over me on your way out. Maybe my mother wouldn't make me go if I was in the hospital.,1
Lorelai,I wouldn't count on it.,1
LANE,,1
EMILY,You're late.,1
LORELAI,How did you do that?,1
EMILY,What?,1
LORELAI,Answer the door before I even rang the bell.,1
EMILY,"I thought I heard something, I came to the door, you were there. Come in please.",1
LORELAI,You thought you heard something?,1
EMILY,Yes.,1
Lorelai,"Mom, that door is like ten feet thick.",1
EMILY,So?,1
Lorelai,"Well, so, it wasn't like I was standing out there with a band of jackals, I was just drinking coffee.",1
EMILY,"Lorelai, what is it that you want to hear? That I was standing by the window, staring out at the driveway, waiting to pounce the moment you arrived.",1
Lorelai,"Yes, because believe it or not, that would be less creepy.",1
EMILY,"Get yourself a drink, please.",1
Lorelai,Hey Dad.,1
RICHARD,Lorelai.,1
Lorelai,"Sorry I'm late. I was helping Rory get ready for her big date, and well, you know girls.",1
RICHARD,Mm hmm.,1
Lorelai,"So. . . um, how's work?",1
RICHARD,"Oh, work is fine.",1
Lorelai,"Yeah? Good, good. My work's fine too.",1
RICHARD,Uh huh.,1
Lorelai,"Oh God. Mom has gone a little crazy with the figurines here, huh? A little Kathy Bates. Although you probably haven't seen Misery, which is a good thing because Rory couldn't sleep alone for a week after we watched it. That wouldn't be a problem for you because you don't sleep alone anyway. I'm guessing. I don't know what your and mom's sleeping arrangement is. Now I'm wishing I hadn't brought it up because it's such a 'Wow, don't wanna go there' kind of a subject. For me, not for you, because you should definitely go there if you uh, well anyway. Agh!",1
RICHARD,"Oh, what have you done now?",1
Lorelai,"Nothing. I just, well, I'm putting the bunny back with his little friends and I just sort of massacred them a little bit, but that's life in the jungle isn't it?",1
RICHARD,"Just sit down, please.",1
Lorelai,"Okay, sorry.",1
RICHARD,Just sit with your hands in your lap.,1
Lorelai,Sorry.,1
RICHARD,"And I'm trying to read, so just be quiet and try not to break anything else",1
EMILY,So are we having a nice chat?,1
Lorelai,"Yeah, we're having a great conversation, me and Morrie.",1
EMILY,Excuse me?,1
Lorelai,"Nothing. Thanks, Mom, for letting Rory out of dinner tonight. She really appreciated it.",1
EMILY,"Well, she deserves to celebrate. A three-month anniversary is a landmark feat at her age. Or at any age for some people.",1
Lorelai,I was gonna get a drink. I'm gonna get right on that.,1
EMILY,I'll get that.,1
Lorelai,Can I freshen up your drink Dad?,1
RICHARD,"No, thank you. One drink before dinner is quite enough.",1
Lorelai,"Right, sorry.",1
EMILY,I had no idea it was so close!,1
CHASE,"Absolutely, right around the corner.",1
EMILY,"Well, what a small world. Oh, Lorelai, I'd like you to meet Chase Bradford.",1
Lorelai,Hey.,1
CHASE,Hi.,1
EMILY,He was just telling me that he actually grew up right around the corner from here.,1
Lorelai,"Oh, really?",1
CHASE,Stone house on the corner.,1
Lorelai,"Oh, the one with the Dobermans.",1
CHASE,That's right. Leopold and Loeb. Though I'm afraid they passed on quite a few years ago.,1
Lorelai,"Postmen finally got organized, huh?",1
EMILY,"Uh, Chase, this is my husband, Richard.",1
RICHARD,How do you do?,1
CHASE,"Fine, Richard, just fine.",1
EMILY,"Uh, please sit down.",1
RICHARD,"Emily, I didn't know we were having company for dinner.",1
EMILY,"Oh well, it was just sort of a spur of the moment thing. Chase's mother and I are in the DAR together and he just moved back to Hatrford, and it just seemed like a nice idea.",1
Lorelai,"Yes, very nice.",1
RICHARD,"Uh Chase, can I get you a drink?",1
CHASE,Scotch neat.,1
RICHARD,"Uh, Glenfiddich?",1
CHASE,"Fine. So Lorelai, your mother's told me all about you.",1
Lorelai,Really?,1
CHASE,Oh yes. I'm just sorry your daughter couldn't join us for dinner. I adore children.,1
Lorelai,"Mom, can I talk to you for a minute?",1
EMILY,"Lorelai, we have company.",1
Lorelai,"It'll just take a second, really.",1
EMILY,But ,1
Lorelai,"Come on, it'll be fun. Excuse us. We're just gonna have a spur of the moment conversation.",1
EMILY,You're pushing me.,1
Lorelai,Is this a setup?,1
EMILY,What?,1
Lorelai,"Uh, Connecticut Ken in there, is he my invited escort for the evening?",1
EMILY,"Lorelai, his mother is a friend of mine.",1
Lorelai,And?,1
EMILY,He just moved back here and doesn't know anyone.,1
Lorelai,And?,1
EMILY,And I thought he might enjoy meeting you.,1
Lorelai,AH HA!,1
EMILY,Put that finger down!,1
Lorelai,"Ah, this is why the Miss Congeniality act when Rory wanted to beg out of dinner.",1
EMILY,It just seemed like a good opportunity.,1
Lorelai,"Mom, thank you for the thought, but I can get my own men.",1
EMILY,Really?,1
Lorelai,"Yes, really.",1
EMILY,I must disagree.,1
Lorelai,You must?,1
EMILY,"Chase is a quality man, he has good breeding, he comes from a nice family. He makes a nice living, he's attractive.",1
Lorelai,"Mom, mmm, no.",1
EMILY,Is it gonna k*ll you to simply keep an open mind about him?,1
Lorelai,"Mom, he's not my type.",1
EMILY,Why not? Because I like him?,1
Lorelai,"You know, I swear, I don't know which one, but there is a game show out there with your name on it.",1
EMILY,Well that must be it because you've hardly said two words to the man. You couldn't possibly hate him already.,1
Lorelai,"Oh no, it's that arcade game w here the mole keeps sticking his head out and you have to pound him as many times as you can with the mallet. You would be a master at that game.",1
EMILY,"Lorelai, I realize that Chase may not be as controversial as your usual brand of men.",1
Lorelai,They would erect a statue of you next to it with perfect hair and pearls and a big bronze mallet.,1
EMILY,But I want you to think about something. Tonight your daughter is celebrating her three- month anniversary. What was the last relationship you had that lasted that long? I thought so.,1
EMILY,"Well, here we are. I'm very sorry.",1
CHASE,"Oh, that's all right. I had a chance to tell Richard a little bit about what I do in the actuarial business.",1
RICHARD,"Yes, it's fascinating.",1
CHASE,"Lorelai, may I fix you something to drink?",1
Lorelai,"Hmm, gin.",1
CHASE,And?,1
Lorelai,Gin.,1
RICHARD,Make that two.,1
Lorelai,What about the one drink before dinner rule?,1
RICHARD,,1
RORY,That was really good.,1
DEAN,It was?,1
RORY,Yes it was.,1
DEAN,How was the salad?,1
RORY,Great.,1
DEAN,What about that cheese bread thing? Too heavy?,1
RORY,Just heavy enough.,1
DEAN,Really?,1
RORY,Everything was perfect. Even the soda was good. I don't know how they do it but the Coke here is definitely superior to the Coke anywhere else.,1
DEAN,"Okay, at what point during that did you start making fun of me?",1
RORY,I would never make fun of you. Especially not after you ordered three different kinds of pasta for me just because I couldn't decide.,1
DEAN,"Well you shouldn't have to decide. I mean, tonight, you should have everything that you want.",1
RORY,I just have to say that I'm now a very big fan of the three-month anniversary.,1
DEAN,Oh yeah?,1
RORY,Definitely. I think they should have T-shirts and newsletters.,1
DEAN,"Well, I'm glad.",1
RORY,You did all this for me.,1
DEAN,It's not over yet.,1
RORY,This is just like that Christmas when I got a full set of illustrated encyclopedias. I wanted them.,1
DEAN,"Oh, uh, good",1
WAITERory,"One tiramisu, two forks, and uh, one meatball to go.",1
RORY,Thank you.,1
DEAN,You wanna explain the meatball?,1
RORY,It's a mother-daughter thing.,1
DEAN,"Okay. Well, uh ladies first.",1
RORY,"Thank you. Okay, have I mentioned how much I'm loving the three month anniversary thing?",1
DEAN,"Yeah, you did.",1
RORY,"Because this tiramisu is so good that if the anniversary were completely sucking right now, this would save it. What?",1
DEAN,Nothing.,1
RORY,Stop it.,1
DEAN,"No, you look cute.",1
RORY,I'm eat ing.,1
DEAN,"Well, you eat cute.",1
RORY,"I do not eat cute. No one eats cute. Bambi maybe, but he's a cartoon.",1
DEAN,"So, uh, after we finish here we move onto phase two of the anniversary evening.",1
RORY,"Phase 2. Sounds very official, are there space suits involved?",1
DEAN,With matching helmets.,1
RORY,,1
CHASE,"So Lorelai, are you a memb er of the DAR?",1
LORELAI,"No, I'm not. D-A-R-N. See, uh, that's like darn 'cause it was a play on DAR. Boy, these carrots sure are tiny.",1
EMILY,"Chase, I'm simply fascinated about your work situation. Tell us how you wound up back here at home. I mean, you move away to make your fortune and you end up right back here. Isn't life funny?",1
LORELAI,Hilarious.,1
RICHARD,It's a comedy for the masses.,1
CHASE,"Well I worked hard and the company was very good to me. You know a thing or two about company loyalty I assume, Richard. Well, the company offered me a choice of East Coast locations, sort of a big vote of confidence in the job I was doing. Picking your locale, it's a very coveted position to be in.",1
LORELAI,"Yeah, would like to be picking my locale right now.",1
CHASE,"So I sat down and made my wish list. I looked for places that offered location amenities as well as job growth, and finally after days of research, checking into traffic conditions, crime rates, the best school systems, my decision came down to just two places. One was in New York, one was in Hartford.",1
LORELAI,And you chose Hartford.,1
CHASE,I did at that.,1
RICHARD,"Emily, is there any more roast?",1
CHASE,"Hartford has all the cosmopolitan big city benefits that New York has, without actually having to live in New York. It just seemed like a no brainer.",1
LORELAI,I'll get dad some mo re roast.,1
EMILY,Leta will bring it.,1
LORELAILorelai,"Oh, but it's so much more personal this way.",1
EMILY,Hurry back. I just simply have to know what the allure of this Stars Hollow is I've heard so much about.,1
LORELAI,,1
DEAN,"So, what book did you bring?",1
RORY,What?,1
DEAN,"Well, come on, you always bring a book with you and I was just wondering, what's the three month anniversary book?",1
RORY,"Actually, I brought the New Yorker.",1
DEAN,A magazine. Really?,1
RORY,It's the fiction issue.,1
MAYORory,"People of Stars Hollow, and our many friends. It gives me great pleasure to preside over our annual founders festival for the thirty-second time. Many a true love has had it start right on the spot where I stand. And I don't mind telling you that at this very festival, right by this gazebo, is where I met my own true love, Miss Dora Braythwait. We have been married for 43 years, and it all started right here.",1
TAYLORory,Ask her to wave.,1
MAYORory,I can't.,1
TAYLORory,Why not?,1
MAYORory,"She went to Bingo in Bridgeport. And now my friends, if you will join me in lighting the fire.",1
RORY,"Okay, take me to the surprise now.",1
DEAN,But I thought you said you wanted to see the bonfire being lit.,1
RORY,Oh I do.,1
DEAN,"Wait, but Mayor Porter just said. . .",1
RORY,Trust me. It's gonna be awhile before it's lit. We'll have plenty of time before they're ready.,1
MAYORory,Every damn year.,1
TAYLORory,It was Lenny's responsibility.,1
AYORory,,1
CHASE,It's really fascinating stuff.,1
EMILY,It sounds it. Tell us more.,1
CHASE,"Well, we're in the middle of building new statistical models that let us do a better job at predicting death than we've ever been able to do before. Richard, you might find this interesting.",1
RICHARD,"Well, I've never been one for sitting at a computer building models, Chase. I'm a client contact man myself.",1
CHASE,But these models give you a better product to sell to those clients.,1
EMILY,That does sound interesting.,1
CHASE,"Oh it is. In fact, if you were to answer a few simple questions for me, I could practically pinpoint the day you're going to die.",1
EMILY,Goodness.,1
LORELAI,Go ahead. Ask her the questions.,1
EMILY,I think I'll pass.,1
CHASE,"No no, Lorelai! I'd have to feed the information into a computer to get the answer. I'm no Kreskin!",1
EMILY,"Well, Chase, why don't you and Lorelai retire to the living room for some Brandy while I help Leta clean up.",1
LORELAI,While you do what?,1
CHASE,That sounds lovely? Shall we?,1
LORELAI,"Uh, sure. I'm just going to, um, go and powder my something. But I'll be back in a minute and I'll meet you in the living room.",1
CHASE,I'll be waiting.,1
LORELAI,,1
RICHARD,"Lorelai, your mother wants to know if. . .",1
LORELAI,"Hi daddy. Okay, I know this is bad. And I know this probably brings back all the horrible aspects of my childhood life for you. And see, I'm really sorry that we fought last week, and I'm really sorry that you're so disappointed in me, and I really wish there was something I can do to fix that, but there probably isn't and I can accept that because I am an adult now and I am proud of who I have become. But I am begging you, please, please do not make me go back down there because that guy is boring.",1
RICHARD,"Emily, she's not up here!",1
LORELAI,,1
DEAN,We're here.,1
ORY,We're where?,1
DEAN,Come on.,1
RORY,"Dean, what is this?",1
DEAN,"Okay. Uh, did you ever see Christine?",1
RORY,Yes.,1
DEAN,"Well, it's nothing like that. Come on.",1
RORY,You brought me to Beirut?,1
DEAN,It's a salvage yard.,1
RORY,Ah. And yet it looks so much like Beirut.,1
DEAN,"Okay. Uh, here we are.",1
RORY,Wow.,1
DEAN,It's a car.,1
RORY,It is?,1
DEAN,"Well, it will be.",1
RORY,When it grows up?,1
DEAN,When I fix it.,1
RORY,What?,1
DEAN,"Um, it's yours.",1
RORY,What do you mean it's mine?,1
DEAN,"I mean, I'm building it piece by piece for you.",1
RORY,No.,1
DEAN,Yeah. I started with the frame. The seats and the windshield just went in yesterday.,1
RORY,You're building me a c ar?,1
DEAN,"Yeah, now it's gonna take awhile, but when I'm done, it'll be great.",1
RORY,You're building me a c ar. You're building me a car.,1
DEAN,That's right.,1
RORY,You're building me a c ar?,1
DEAN,I'm building you a car.,1
RORY,This is crazy. Why would you do this?,1
DEAN,I don't know. You didn't have one.,1
RORY,You're completely insane.,1
DEAN,"What? I didn't want you wasting time on the bus anymore. I mean, that is very valuable time we could be arguing about your ongoing obsession with very confusing Russian authors.",1
RORY,I can't believe this,1
DEAN,"Um, do you like it?",1
RORY,Do I like it? Are you kidding?,1
DEAN,I'll take that as a yes.,1
RORY,Take it mister.,1
DEAN,"Come on, get in.",1
DEAN,"Uh, I'll fix that.",1
RORY,Don't. I like it like that. This is amazing.,1
DEAN,I'm glad you like it.,1
RORY,I had no idea that three months was the car anniversary.,1
DEAN,Four months you get a plane.,1
RORY,"Boy, relationships sure have changed since I was a kid. I'm having one of those moments right now.",1
DEAN,What moments?,1
RORY,One of those moments that everything is so perfect and so wonderful that you almost feel sad because nothing can ever be this good again.,1
DEAN,"So, basically, I'm depressing you.",1
RORY,Yup.,1
DEAN,You're very weird.,1
RORY,And you're wonderful.,1
DEAN,Rory?,1
RORY,Yeah?,1
DEAN,I love you. Rory?,1
RORY,Yeah?,1
DEAN,Did you hear me?,1
RORY,Uh huh.,1
DEAN,"Well, say something.",1
RORY,I. . . I. .,1
DEAN,Yeah?,1
RORY,I love the car.,1
DEAN,"Uh, and that's it?",1
RORY,"No. I just. . . I'm surprised, I didn't expect. . .I don't. . .",1
DEAN,You don't love me.,1
RORY,"No, I just have to think about it for a minute.",1
DEAN,Think about what?,1
RORY,"Well, saying I love you is a really difficult thing.",1
DEAN,Well I just did it.,1
RORY,And you did it really well.,1
DEAN,What the hell does that mean?,1
RORY,"I'm sorry. Please. This totally came as a surprise. I mean, with the dinner, and the car, and then the  I just need a minute to think",1
DEAN,This is not something that you think about Rory. This is either something that you feel or you don't.,1
RORY,"Please, don't be mad.",1
DEAN,"Why? Because I say I love you and you wanna think about it? I mean, go home and discuss it with your mother? Make one of your pro/con lists?",1
RORY,Not fair.,1
DEAN,I'm sorry. I'm an idiot. I don't even know what I was thinking.,1
RORY,"Dean. Please, it's just not that easy for me. I mean, saying I love you means a lot. Think about it from my point of view. I mean, my mom and our life. I mean, my mom said that she loved my dad and then. . .",1
DEAN,You don't get pregnant saying I love you.,1
RORY,I know. I'm just confused. I need to It's a really big deal.,1
DEAN,"Fine, come on.",1
RORY,"Dean, please don't be mad.",1
DEAN,I'll take you home.,1
RORY,"Dean, tonight was amazing. It was perfect. Please, I swear, I just need a minute to. . .",1
DEAN,,1
JACKSON,Sookie?,1
SOOKIE,Yes Jackson?,1
JACKSON,You know what I'm thinking about right now?,1
SOOKIE,That time I roasted some red peppers over the stove burner and singed off my eyebrows?,1
JACKSON,No.,1
SOOKIE,Good.,1
JACKSON,"I'm just thinking, this is really nice.",1
SOOKIE,Me too.,1
LUKE,You getting some good stuff?,1
RACHELorelai,"Oh yeah, yeah, the firelight really changes people. Ya know, makes them seem happier, freer, all troubles of the world completely gone.",1
LUKE,I don't think that's the firelight. I think it's the Founders Day party punch they've been selling.,1
RACHELorelai,"Oh yeah, that stuff is",1
goodLUKE,"Okay, at some point, are you gonna tell me what you're doing here?",1
RACHELorelai,I'm putting more film in my camera.,1
LUKE,Rachel.,1
RACHELorelai,"What? I told you, I was at the airport, now I'm here.",1
LUKE,"Oh well sure, when you put it like that.",1
RACHELorelai,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but you don't sound all that happy to see me.",1
LUKE,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but you have a tendency to show up and then leave, quite suddenly. One of your more charming attributes.",1
RACHELorelai,"So you're not happy to see me? Luke, I don't know what I'm doing here. I just missed you. I wanted to see you. I don't know what else to say.",1
LUKE,I missed you too.,1
RACHELorelai,"So since we're both being blunt, what's the deal with Lorelai?",1
LUKE,What are you talking about?,1
RACHELorelai,"I'm talking about Lorelai, the lady who runs the inn, the one you've told me absolutely nothing about, and been very careful to leave out of every story, anecdote, or gossip about the town.",1
LUKE,There is no deal with Lorelai. We're friends.,1
RACHELorelai,For now?,1
LUKE,Yes.,1
RACHELorelai,And in the future?,1
LUKE,"Well, Lorelai is, she's just uh I don't know. I mean, at time it seems like, I don't know. But I am happy to see you.",1
RACHELorelai,Good. I'm gonna get some of that party punch. You want some?,1
LUKE,That stuff will k*ll you.,1
RACHELorelai,"Oh Luke, some things never change.",1
LORELAI,Hey. Where the hell's the fire department when you need them?,1
LUKE,"Hey, aren't you supposed to be in Hartford?",1
LORELAI,Yeah.,1
LUKE,What happened?,1
LORELAI,Climbed out the window.,1
LUKE,Okay.,1
LORELAI,That's it. You're not curious why?,1
LUKE,No.,1
LORELAI,That's what I love about you.,1
LUKE,"Hey, how long you been here?",1
LORELAI,A little while.,1
LUKE,Did you see Harry and Taylor get into a fist fight?,1
LORELAI,No! Aww! How did I miss that? I'm so bummed!,1
LUKE,It was good.,1
LORELAI,So where's Rachel?,1
LUKE,"Oh, she's a founder's party punch junkie.",1
LORELAI,"God, even the nice girls aren't safe.",1
LUKE,Yeah. She's been running around here taking all kinds of pictures.,1
LORELAI,She's having a good time.,1
LUKE,I guess so. I hope so.,1
LORELAI,So?,1
LUKE,Yes?,1
LORELAI,"So, what's the haps with you two?",1
LUKE,"The haps? Well, lets see. What is the haps?",1
LORELAI,"I mean, like, ya know, what's going. . .",1
LUKE,I know what you meant by the haps.,1
LORELAI,"Okay, well you're repeating it like a thousand times.",1
LUKE,I was pondering.,1
LORELAI,Well you ponder really slowly.,1
LUKE,If I did it fast it wouldn't be pondering. Pondering by nature is a slow connotation.,1
LORELAI,"Okay. Fine, fine.",1
LUKE,It's okay.,1
LORELAI,Is she staying?,1
LUKE,I don't know.,1
LORELAI,Do you want her to?,1
LUKE,I don't know.,1
LORELAI,She seems to really like you.,1
LUKE,"Yeah she does, but she doesn't have the greatest attention span.",1
LORELAI,Yeah.,1
LUKE,But she is here.,1
LORELAI,"Yes, she is.",1
LUKE,"I don't know. You spend a lot of time debating things, ya know, is it right, is it wrong, or should I do this, should I do that. I mean, sometimes you should just jump in and take a shot. What's the worst that can happen? She left before, I lived. Maybe this time.",1
LORELAI,I think that's really great.,1
LUKE,You do?,1
LORELAI,Yeah.,1
LUKE,Thanks.,1
LORELAI,You're welcome,1
LUKE,"Well, I guess I'm gonna go check up on Rachel.",1
LORELAI,That's nice.,1
LUKE,What?,1
LORELAI,That you have somebody you can go check up on. That's nice.,1
LUKE,Yeah it is. Unless she's completely drunk and throwing up.,1
LORELAI,Still nice.,1
LUKE,I'll see you tomorrow?,1

LORELAI,"Ok, ok, come on",1
RORY,"After I told the waiter to wrap it up and everything. And everyone was like  what do you want with one meatball?' And I was like  It's a mother/daughter thing.' And I'm sure he thought I was nuts but he was so nice and he did it anyway and he uh, he brought one of those tin foil swans or duck or some kind of bird and - and then I left it in the car.",1
LORELAI,"Ok, forget about the meatball ok? Just tell me what happened.",1
RORY,He just broke up with me ok?,1
LORELAI,That doesn't make sense. This is Dean we're talking about. He's crazy about you. He calls like 25 times a day. Have you seen the cover of his notebook? It's one step away from stalker material.,1
RORY,I have to go to bed.,1
LORELAI,"Well, wait. Take me through the night step by step.",1
Posted,03/27/01 09:17,1
RORY,Why?,1
LORELAI,So I can help decipher what happened here.,1
RORY,"What happened here is we broke up. He didn't want to be my boyfriend anymore, end of story.",1
LORELAI,That is so not end of story.,1
RORY,Yes it is.,1
LORELAI,"Honey, he did not plan an entire romantic evening complete with dinner and a junkyard, which we'll get back to later, and then suddenly decide to dump you for no reason.",1
RORY,How do you know?,1
LORELAI,"Because I have read every Nancy Drew mystery ever written. The one about the Amish country, twice. I know there's more to the story than what you're telling me. What are you doing?",1
RORY,I'm getting rid of all this stuff.,1
LORELAI,What stuff?,1
RORY,"Everything he gave me, everything he touched, everything he looked at.",1
LORELAI,"Honey, will you just calm down for just one second.",1
RORY,He doesn't want to be my boyfriend - fine.,1
LORELAI,"Ok ,it will be fine but -",1
RORY,What?,1
LORELAI,Mine.,1
RORY,Oh.,1
LORELAI,Is there someone else?,1
RORY,No.,1
LORELAI,Is he moving?,1
RORY,No.,1
LORELAI,"Uh, is he dying? Did his football team lose a game?",1
RORY,What ?,1
LORELAI,"It's happened. Did he, um, try something?",1
RORY,What?,1
LORELAI,"You know, did he wanna ",1
RORY,What?,1
LORELAI,Did he wanna go faster than you -,1
RORY,God no!,1
LORELAI,"Ok, ok, I'm sorry.",1
RORY,Jeez..,1
LORELAI,You're just not giving me a l ot to go off of here. Honey that's your fancy dress that I made for you.,1
RORY,That I wore to a dance that I went to with him.,1
LORELAI,Oh yeah. Sweater's brand-new.,1
RORY,Well he saw me in it yesterday and he liked it.,1
LORELAI,Well then he's got good taste.,1
RORY,He said it brought out the blue in my eyes.,1
LORELAI,Well then he's gay.,1
RORY,You're not funny and it goes.,1
LORELAI,I'm a little funny and if you throw away everything Dean ever saw you wear you're gonna be walking around in a towel. Colonel Clucker? Are you serious? He has been with you since you were four.,1
RORY,"The first time D ean came over, he picked it up.",1
LORELAI,"Well that's the not the colonel's fault. He was sitting there minding his own business and a guy comes in and picks him up, what's a stuffed bird to do?",1
RORY,"I don't want to joke about this, not now.",1
LORELAI,Ok.,1
RORY,Here. I don't want to look at that anymore.,1
LORELAI,"Ok, I'll, um, I'll put it away.",1
RORY,"No, take it out of the house. Throw it in a dumpster, burn it, I don't care. Just - I want it gone.",1
LORELAI,"You know honey, some day, when all of this is in the past, you may be sorry that you don't have some of those things anymore.",1
RORY,I don't care.,1
LORELAI,But Rory -,1
RORY,I don't care!,1
LORELAI,Ok. Fine. It's gone.,1
RORY,Thank you.,1
LORELAI,So I'll take care of this and you go to bed and get some rest. Maybe you'll fell more like talking in the morning.,1
RORY,Ok.,1
LORELAI,"Honey, good night.",1
RORY,Mom ,1
LORELAI,Yeah.,1
RORY,"Far, far away from the house ok?",1
LORELAI,"Hey, it sleeps with the fishes.",1
RORY,Thank you.,1
RORY,Mom.,1
LORELAI,Mmm.,1
RORY,Mom get up.,1
LORELAI,Rory what's the matter?,1
RORY,"Nothing, I just want to get started. I made a list of all the things we say we're going to do on the weekend but then when the weekend comes around you say they're too boring to actually do one a weekend day, so then you say we'll do them during the week, which of course we never do. So I think that we should get them all out of the way today once and for all. And to make it interesting, we should come up with like a reward system so once we're done with everything on the list we could go get manicures or we could go to the Swiss place for fondue for dinner or we could stuff our purses full of sour patch kids and milk duds and go see the Stars Hollow elementary school production of  Who's afraid of Virginia Woolfe.'",1
LORELAI,It's 6:00.,1
RORY,I know.,1
LORELAI,On Saturday morning.,1
RORY,That's right.,1
LORELAI,It's 6:00 on Saturday morning!,1
RORY,Do you want to wear docks or sneakers?,1
LORELAI,I want to wear slippers.,1
RORY,Up please.,1
LORELAI,"Rory, my heart. It is Saturday, the day of rest.",1
RORY,Sunday's the day of rest.,1
LORELAI,"No, Saturday is the day of pre-rest.",1
RORY,Pre-rest?,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, so that way when you actually get to Sunday you're rested enough to enjoy your rest.",1
RORY,That makes absolutely no sense.,1
LORELAI,That's because it's 6:00 on Saturday morning. Oh jeez!,1
RORY,Up please!,1
LORELAI,You make a rhyme.,1
RORY,I'll see you downstairs.,1
LORELAI,Ugh!,1
LORELAI,Hello. Did you rearrange the furniture?,1
RORY,Yes.,1
LORELAI,"Good, cause for a minute there I thought we were having a problem with decorator elves and I was gonna have to call an exterminator and tent the place but it was just you. Great. Good. So now was there any reason that you just suddenly felt the need to move around large pieces of furniture first thing in the morning?",1
RORY,"I was up, it was there.",1
LORELAI,Ok good thought process. Great. Now I noticed you didn't move the tv though.,1
RORY,It was too heavy.,1
LORELAI,"Right, ok. Well I like this, yeah, this is good. Now of course when the sofa actually faced the tv it made it a little easier to watch but you know this is good too. It'll be like um, you know like radio.",1
RORY,Are you ready to go?,1
LORELAI,"Yes I am, just uh, just one quick sec. Um, why don't you - could you put the pen down?",1
RORY,Just finishing the list.,1
LORELAI,"Yes I see and as much as I love your list, let's just finish this particular one in a little while ok?",1
RORY,Ok.,1
LORELAI,"Rory, I'm concerned about you. I wish you would talk to me.",1
RORY,I don't want to deal with it right now. I can't deal with it right now.,1
LORELAI,"Fair enough. But listen, I've had my heart broken before. It's really hard. It's hard for everyone, so can I give you a little advice.",1
RORY,Ok.,1
LORELAI,I think what you really need to do today is wallow.,1
RORY,Wallow?,1
LORELAI,"Oh yeah, get back in your pajamas, go to bed, eat nothing but gallons of ice cream and tons of pizza, don't take a shower or shave your legs or put on any kind of make up at all and just sit in the dark and watch a really sad movie and have a good long cry and just wallow. You need to wallow.",1
RORY,No.,1
LORELAI,"Rory, your first love is intense and your first break up even more intense. Shoving it away and ignoring it while you make lists it's not gonna help.",1
RORY,I don't want to wallow.,1
LORELAI,Try it for one day.,1
RORY,No.,1
LORELAI,"One day, one day of pizza and pajamas. I'll rent  Love Story' and  The Champ', 'An Affair to Rememb er',  Ishtar'.",1
RORY,I don't want to be that kind of girl.,1
LORELAI,the kind of girl that watches  Ishtar'?,1
RORY,The kind of girl who just falls apart because she doesn't have a boyfriend.,1
LORELAI,That description hardly applies to you.,1
RORY,It will if I wallow.,1
LORELAI,Not true.,1
RORY,"So I used to have a boyfriend and now I don't. Ok, that's just the way it is. I mean sitting in the dark eating junk food and not shaving my legs isn't gonna change that, is it?",1
LORELAI,No.,1
RORY,"Ok, so I don't even want to go there. I have things to do, I have school and Harvard to think about.",1
LORELAI,"Honey, Harvard is like three years away.",1
RORY,But now is the time to be preparing for it. I mean Harvard is hard to get into and I don't know why I even spend my time thinking about anything else.,1
LORELAI,Because you have a pulse and you are not the president of the audio visual club.,1
RORY,"I'm 16, I have the rest of my life to have a boyfriend. I should be keeping my eye on the prize right now.",1
LORELAI,I admire your attitude.,1
RORY,Thank you.,1
LORELAI,So should we rent  Old Yeller' too or is that just a guy's crying movie.,1
RORY,You're not listening to me.,1
LORELAI,"I am listening to you, I just - I don't agree with you.",1
RORY,"I don't want to wallow, and you can't make me.",1
LORELAI,Ok. Fine.,1
RORY,Thank you.,1
LORELAI,So that must be the list.,1
RORY,Yes it is.,1
LORELAI,May I see it please? We do not need a garden hose.,1
RORY,We don't have one.,1
LORELAI,We don't have a garden either.,1
RORY,But maybe if we have a hose we can grow one.,1
LORELAI,Can I see the pen please?,1
RORY,Why?,1
LORELAI,"Small adjustment, small adjustment.",1
RORY,Mom...,1
LORELAI,What? It's on the list. Don't you have to do it if it's on the list?!,1
RORY,I'm not going to wallow,1
LORELAI,,1
LORELAI,What are all these people doing up? It's Saturday morning.,1
RORY,Some people like getting up early.,1
LORELAI,You lie.,1
RORY,No they do it voluntarily.,1
LORELAI,Really?,1
RORY,Everyday.,1
LORELAI,Ha! Jumpback!,1
RORY,Excuse me?,1
LORELAI,"Kevin Bacon, Footloose, reaction to the no dancing in town rule is revealed to him by Chris Penn, brother to Sean, sage to all.",1
RORY,I shoulda known.,1
LORELAI,Yes you should. I don't know what they teach you in that damn school. What?,1
RORY,I can't go that way.,1
LORELAI,"Why, we're going to Luke's.",1
RORY,No.,1
LORELAI,You pull me out of bed at 6:00 in the morning and then you say  no' to Luke's? Don't you know how dangerous that is?,1
RORY,I can't go that way.,1
LORELAI,Reason please?,1
RORY,Because we'd have to go by Doose's market.,1
LORELAI,So?,1
RORY,So we might run into -,1
LORELAI,Oh.,1
RORY,Yeah.,1
LORELAI,"Right. Um, you don't know if he's working?",1
RORY,I don't rememb er. His weekend schedule changes a lot.,1
LORELAI,"Ok, well we'll just take the long way.",1
RORY,No.,1
LORELAI,Why?,1
RORY,We'd have to go by the school.,1
LORELAI,But there's no school today.,1
RORY,But on his days off from work he plays football at the school with some of his friends.,1
LORELAI,Well what time?,1
RORY,It varies.,1
LORELAI,"Ok, well we'll just go down Peach street, we'll circle around, you're shaking your head why?",1
RORY,He lives on Peach.,1
LORELAI,"Rory, honey, love of my life, you realize you've completely cut us from Luke's where the happy coffee is.",1
RORY,I'm sorry.,1
LORELAI,,1
RORY,Sorry.,1
LORELAI,"No, this is good. This is like  G.I. Jane' but we get to keep our hair.",1
RORY,I just couldn't.,1
LORELAI,"Oh honey, say no more. Think of this as an adventure. Two girls battling the elements, desperate for survival.",1
RORY,Or coffee.,1
LORELAI,Same thing.,1
RORY,You know I bet you can tell a lot about people from their garbage.,1
LORELAI,Yeah.,1
RORY,"Think about it, trash is discarded aspect of people's lives.",1
LORELAI,Hmm.,1
RORY,"It talks about their eating habits, what they read, do they go to concerts, are they responsible, do they pay bills on time?",1
LORELAI,"Yeah, you do know honey, that garbage doesn't actually talk at all unless it's on Sesame Street.",1
RORY,I'm just trying to make a point.,1
LORELAI,That going through people's garbage is interesting.,1
RORY,And educational.,1
LORELAI,And stinky and a little nuts.,1
RORY,There's nothing nuts about wanting to know more about human nature. Curiosity is how we grow.,1
LORELAI,,1
LORELAI,Who are all these people?,1
RORY,It's the 6:00 am crowd.,1
LORELAI,I officially recognize nobody in this place.,1
RACHELorelai,Hey.,1
LORELAI,Oh hi.,1
RACHELorelai,Coffee while you wait?,1
LORELAI,Oh bless you. So Luke put you to work huh?,1
RACHELorelai,Yeah well I figured if I'm going to be hanging around here for a while the least I could do is help out.,1
LORELAI,So you're gonna be hanging around for a while...here?,1
RACHELorelai,Yeah I think so.,1
LORELAI,Oh well that's nice.,1
RACHELorelai,Yeah.,1
RORY,So where is Luke?,1
RACHELorelai,Well we were kind of up late last night so I let him sleep in.,1
LORELAI,Sleep in? Luke?,1
RACHELorelai,"Oh believe me it wasn't easy to get him to agree to it, but in the end, a little sweet talk, a couple of Excedrin PM he finally caved.",1
RORY,Hey there's a seat over there.,1
LORELAI,Great.,1
RACHELorelai,"Oh go, go! I'll be over in a sec.",1
LORELAI,Ok.,1
RORY,I feel like everyone is staring at me.,1
LORELAI,"Well yeah, because you've got a banana peel stuck to your foot.",1
RORY,I do?,1
LORELAI,I'm kidding. Nobody's staring at you.,1
RORY,They know.,1
LORELAI,They don't know.,1
RORY,It's probably all around town by now.,1
LORELAI,"Honey it just happened last night, it's like 6:00 in the morning.",1
RORY,Everyone knows that I've been dumped.,1
LORELAI,Do you want to go home?,1
RORY,"No, we have a list.",1
LORELAI,"Ok great. I'm gonna order us something. Any preference - eggs, french toast, key to the dumpster?",1
RORY,I don't care.,1
LORELAI,,1
PATTY,"Lorelai, what a nice surprise so early in the morning. So how's things?",1
LORELAI,,1
PATTY,Yes and I feel awful. I feel completely responsible.,1
LORELAI,,1
PATTY,"Well I got Dean that job and I certainly encouraged them, I felt they were so right together.",1
LORELAI,,1
PATTY,"Oh of course, not a peep.",1
LORELAI,,1
PATTY,"Consider it done. Oh and Lorelai, would you give the angel a hug for me. I mean you don't have to say it's from me, just give her a hug.",1
LORELAI,,1
PATTY,Ok.,1
LORELAI,"Oh well, uh, good morning sleeping beauty.",1
LUKE,"Yeah, well you know Rachel thought I looked a little tired.",1
LORELAI,"No, it's good. You need a little break.",1
LUKE,I guess.,1
LORELAI,You do. So she seems pretty comfortable here huh?,1
LUKE,Yeah well she always could just fit in places you know. It's a talent of hers.,1
LORELAI,She looks good in your apron.,1
LUKE,"Yeah well, can I get you anything?",1
LORELAI,"Oh, um, do you think you could make those really crazy chocolate chip pancakes and go extra heavy on the chocolate?",1
LUKE,"Yeah sure, any special occasion?",1
LORELAI,Dean broke up with Rory.,1
LUKE,What?!,1
LORELAI,"Keep it down, she doesn't want anybody to know about it.",1
LUKE,"Oh I knew it, I just knew that kid was trouble.",1
LORELAI,"Yes you did, you knew it. Pancakes please.",1
LUKE,"Oh God, he's got a nerve. I mean what does he think he's gonna do better than Rory? Is he crazy? Jeez. Alright, well forget it ok. Good riddance, adios, bienvenidos, hasta la vista.",1
LORELAI,Could we get off the small world ride and start cooking please?,1
LUKE,How is she?,1
LORELAI,She's been dumped by her first boyfriend.,1
LUKE,"Oh man, I swear I would love to - ok, I'm gonna put some whipped cream on the pancakes too.",1
LORELAI,Thank you Luke.,1
LUKE,Yeah.,1
LORELAI,Not a word ok?,1
LUKE,I got it.,1
KIRK,"I never liked him. I don't know what it was, something about the shape of his forehead or his height or the floppy hair style. Actually yes, on reflection I think it was the floppy hair style.",1
LORELAI,Hey good morning Kirk.,1
KIRK,"Lorelai, I want to express my apologies for not voicing my concerns about that floppy haired jerk earlier because if I had -",1
LORELAI,Oh you know what - you need to leave now.,1
KIRK,I cannot go until you accept my apology.,1
LORELAI,I accept your apology.,1
KIRK,Alright.,1
LORELAI,Ok.,1
KIRK,It will not happen again.,1
LORELAI,Ok.,1
RORY,Thank you.,1
LORELAI,Honey are you sure you don't want to -,1
RORY,Don't say  wallow'.,1
LORELAI,Swallow your coffee before you eat?,1
RORY,I am fine.,1
LORELAI,But if you could see the look on your face.,1
RORY,It's the same look you had on your face when you broke up with Max. Did wallowing help you get over him?,1
LORELAI,"I'm not saying wallowing will help you get over Dean. It's part of the process. It's the mourning period. It's a step, an important step. The only thing that will get you over somebody is time.",1
RORY,How much time did it take you to get over Max?,1
LORELAI,I'm not sure exactly.,1
RORY,Approximately?,1
LORELAI,I didn't clock it.,1
RORY,Ballpark figure?,1
LORELAI,A while.,1
RORY,Be vaguer.,1
LORELAI,Rory come on.,1
LUKE,"More coffee? Pancakes are coming right up, anything else I can get you?",1
RORY,No thanks.,1
LUKE,"Hey I've got some strawberries back there, you like strawberries don't you?",1
RORY,Yeah I like strawberries but -,1
LUKE,I'm getting you strawberries.,1
RORY,You told him didn't you?,1
LORELAI,No. Miss Patty did.,1
RORY,Well who told Miss Patty?,1
LORELAI,"I don't know, numerous sources.",1
LUKE,Stop right there.,1
DEAN,What?,1
LUKE,Where are you going?,1
DEAN,To get coffee.,1
LUKE,Wrong.,1
DEAN,Excuse me?,1
LUKE,You're not going in there buddy.,1
DEAN,What are you talking about?,1
LUKE,Turn around bag boy.,1
DEAN,Are you serious?,1
LUKE,Do you see a smile on my face?,1
DEAN,No but what's different about that?,1
LUKE,What's that supposed to mean?,1
DEAN,It's just that you're not exactly known as the town crack up.,1
LUKE,So you're a smart guy now huh?,1
DEAN,What are you doing?,1
LUKE,Just exercising my right not to serve you.,1
DEAN,What are you talking about? I'm not even inside yet. Let go of me!,1
LUKE,You first.,1
RORY,"If you tell Miss Patty, everybody in town is gonna know.",1
LORELAI,Honey people have their own lives and their own problems. I hardly think you and Dean breaking up is the main thing on their minds. Oh my God!Oh!,1
RORY,What? Oh my God.,1
LORELAI,"Hey, hey, hey, cut it out! Break it up! You back off! Come here! What do you think you're doing?!",1
LUKE,He started it!,1
LORELAI,By doing what?,1
LUKE,He was coming in.,1
LORELAI,Are you a lunatic! He's 16!,1
LUKE,Well what was I supposed to do?!,1
LORELAI,Well stand in the middle of the street and have a slap fight of course! Come here!,1
RORY,Are you ok?,1
DEAN,I'm fine.,1
RORY,"Oh good, I don't know what go into Luke. He's usually so -",1
DEAN,I have to go.,1
RORY,"Oh sure, bye.",1
LORELAI,Get inside now. Inside - now!,1
LUKE,He started it.,1
LORELAI,Hey.,1
RORY,Hey.,1
LORELAI,So where's that list?,1
RORY,What?,1
LORELAI,"The list, we've got a lot to do Missy, otherwise I'm gonna be dragging your butt outta bed at 6:00 again tomorrow morning. So, where do we start?",1
RORY,Well we need a soap dish for the kitchen,1
LORELAI,,1
RORY,Well that was a very successful outing for us.,1
LORELAI,Yes it was.,1
RORY,We got everything on the list except for the brown extension cord.,1
LORELAI,Which will be in on Tuesday.,1
RORY,So I think that that qualifies as a check too.,1
LORELAI,Are you happy?,1
RORY,"I appreciate a job well done, yeah.",1
LORELAI,I can't wait to try the toaster pizza. It looks so gross which is usually the mark for a great junk food.,1
RORY,Beefaroni.,1
LORELAI, nough said.,1
RORY,I'm gonna go plug in my new wall air freshener. Give me five minutes and then come sniff my room.,1
LORELAI,Cheese or pepperoni?,1
RORY,Whatever.,1
LORELAI,Both. Good choice.,1
BABETTE,"Hey Sugar, I just heard. Where is she? Poor little thing. Rory sweetie!",1
LORELAI,Come on.,1
BABETTE,What? Is she outside?,1
LORELAI,"Uh, well yeah. Babette I appreciate you coming over like this bur Rory's not really in a talking mood just now.",1
BABETTE,But I can help.,1
LORELAI,I know you can.,1
BABETTE,I can tell her how you have to go through a lot of bad relationship's to get to that really good one.,1
LORELAI,"No, it's very good advice.",1
BABETTE,Oh yeah and I can tell her about all the horrible men I've known in my day.,1
LORELAI,Oh that'd be great.,1
BABETTE,Really truly awful men.,1
LORELAI,Babette.,1
BABETTE,I was pushed out of a moving car once.,1
LORELAI,Now that's a peppy little anecdote.,1
BABETTE,Let me tell her.,1
LORELAI,Oh I want you to tell her all that but just not now.,1
BABETTE,Is she really bad?,1
LORELAI,She'll be fine. Really.,1
LORELAI,Oh they had some of our mail.,1
RORY,Look,1
LORELAI,Madeline's having a party.,1
RORY,I'm going to go.,1
LORELAI,You're going to a Chilton party?,1
RORY,Yes I am.,1
LORELAI,"Honey, why don't you just stay home and read  The bell jar'? Same effect.",1
RORY,"Hey, I'm going to be going to school there for the next two and a half years. It wouldn't k*ll me to be social right? What's wrong with that?",1
LORELAI,Nothing.,1
RORY,Ok then it's settled.,1
LORELAI,"Um, can I make a suggestion?",1
RORY,Go ahead.,1
LORELAI,Why don't you see if Lane can come with you? You know that way if the socializing doesn't turn out how you planned you got a friendly face around.,1
RORY,"Ok, good idea. Thank you.",1
LORELAI,You're welcome.,1
RORY,Can I take the car?,1
LORELAI,Yes.,1
RORY,Can I borrow something to wear?,1
LORELAI,Yes.,1
RORY,Are you gonna give in to anything I say because you feel sorry for me?,1
LORELAI,Yes!,1
RORY,I'll make a list.,1
RORY,"Here, hand me that blush.",1
LANE,Ok.,1
RORY,Am I all twisty back here?,1
LANE,"Oh, a little. Here. So how are you?",1
RORY,I'm...fine.,1
LANE,How are you really?,1
RORY,Life goes on right?,1
LANE,You know I saw Dean today. I wasn't sure if I should tell you.,1
RORY,Why not?,1
LANE,I mean I wasn't sure you'd want to know.,1
RORY,"No, that's fine. What'd he say?",1
LANE,Nothing. He crossed the street as soon as I saw him.,1
RORY,Oh.,1
LANE,But if it's any consolation he looks really sad.,1
RORY,I don't want him to be sad.,1
LANE,Rory are you sure you want to go out tonight?,1
RORY,Why does everyone keep asking me that?,1
LANE,"Because you just broke up. I mean I'd be perfectly fine to just hang out here and listen to music and talk, not talk, whatever.",1
RORY,"No, I am not hanging out. We are going to this party. It's gonna be great. I don't want to dwell on this. That's final.",1
LORELAI,Don't argue with her or you'll find yourself the proud owner of three garden weasels.,1
RORY,Mom.,1
LORELAI,"Three cause one's just not enough. Here, turn around.",1
RORY,Why?,1
LORELAI,14 hours of labor that's why.,1
RORY,Fine.,1
LORELAI,And hair.,1

RORY,It's pretty.,1
LORELAI,Yeah it's really pretty. Here. Here is the phone and some mad money. If for any reason you think you're not going to be home by 12:00 you call me.,1
LANE,Oh we'll be back by 12:00,1
LORELAI,"Hi, call me.",1
LANE,Sorry.,1
LORELAI,Rory?,1
RORY,The cornstarch.,1
LORELAI,What?,1
RORY,Um the cornstarch. The first time Dean kissed me he - I forgot to put it with the other things. I'll just throw it out.,1
LORELAI,"Hey why don't you let me do that, you guys get going ok?",1
RORY,Ok.,1
LORELAI,,1
LORELAI,Hey.,1
SOOKIE,"Hi, Lorelai, hey.",1
LORELAI,I wanted to ask you -,1
SOOKIE,"Uh-huh, sure whatever.",1
LORELAI,Sookie? Hello? Sookie honey.,1
SOOKIE,"Yeah. Hi, ah! How are you?",1
LORELAI,"Good, I'm fine, how's that xray vision coming?",1
SOOKIE,Jackson's inside.,1
LORELAI,Is he doing something dirty?,1
SOOKIE,He's making me dinner.,1
LORELAI,Oh! Oh that's so nice.,1
SOOKIE,"Yeah it is. It really is, it's sweet. I'm just - do you hear something?",1
LORELAI,Like what?,1
SOOKIE,Like someone using the wrong size pan to sweat the onions in.,1
LORELAI,"No, nothing like that.",1
SOOKIE,"Ok well maybe I'm hearing things. So hi, how are you?",1
LORELAI,Fine. So I wanted to see -,1
SOOKIE,Could you peek inside the kitchen for me and tell me if the orange Creuset is on the left burner.,1
LORELAI,Why don't you just go in there?,1
SOOKIE,Yeah well now I would but Jackson kicked me out.,1
LORELAI,He did.,1
SOOKIE,Yes and he won't let me back in there and it's driving me crazy.,1
LORELAI,"Well maybe he just wants you to relax, I wouldn't mind that either actually.",1
SOOKIE,Just take a peek for me w ill you? Tell him you want some water. And here. Take a picture for me.,1
LORELAI,Oh Sookie. I am not spying on Jackson.,1
SOOKIE,What if he's using the wrong spoon in the wrong sauce?,1
LORELAI,Then the world as we know it will end.,1
SOOKIE,I have to go in there.,1
JACKSON,You stay right where you are.,1
SOOKIE,Jackson you're being unreasonable.,1
JACKSON,"Sookie when a person offers to make another person dinner because this person happens to be a chef and is always cooking for others, that is what happens to be a nice gesture.",1
SOOKIE,Yes but -,1
JACKSON,"And when that person accepts the first person's offer, that means that the first person, the one who offered to cook, would actually be doing the cooking while the other person relaxed, had some w ine and stayed out of the kitchen!",1
SOOKIE,"I wasn't cooking, I was suggesting.",1
JACKSON,Well you suggested the ladle right out of my hand four times!,1
SOOKIE,I had to skim the top of the sauce or it would've gotten all -,1
JACKSON,"Damn it Sookie, this is supposed to be romantic!",1
SOOKIE,It is!,1
JACKSON,Stay outta here. I am cooking this meal alone. I am also cleaning up alone.,1
SOOKIE,No.,1
JACKSON,Oh yes.,1
SOOKIE,"But you don't know how to load my dishwasher, I have a system.",1
JACKSON,I'll wing it.,1
SOOKIE,There's a diagram in the pantry - use it. I'm begging you!,1
JACKSON,"I'm doing two loads, just because I can!",1
LORELAI,Honey try and sit down and relax. It's nice what he's doing.,1
SOOKIE,"I know you're right. It is nice. Ok, alright...I'm sitting, I'm relaxing, I'm focusing on you.",1
LORELAI,Good. Um actually I wanted to ask you a favour.,1
SOOKIE,What?,1
LORELAI,"Could I take your car for a little while, Rory's got mine and there's something I want to do.",1
SOOKIE,"Yeah, yeah, yeah of course. What's so important?",1
LORELAI,"Oh um, I'll tell you later.",1
SOOKIE,It sounds serious.,1
LORELAI,I'll have it back to you as soon as I can.,1
SOOKIE,"Take your time, I'm in for the night.",1
LORELAI,"Ok, bye hon.",1
SOOKIE,,1
LORELAI,Hi.,1
MAX,Lorelai what...,1
LORELAI,Rory and Dean broke up.,1
MAX,"Oh, well, I'm sorry. Rory -",1
LORELAI,"Yeah, Rory and Dean broke up and um, she won't wallow. And I told her that she should wallow you know because that's supposed to help you get through the pain and then you can accept it and then you can get over somebody and you can move on with your life. And then she asked me how long it was before I got over you and I didn't know what to say you know because I can't lie to her, and I realized that if I gave her any time frame at all I would be lying because I'm not over you and I don't know how long it will be before I am. And who am I to be teaching her about healing and moving on and breakups any how. I mean I might as well be teaching her how to eat fire or swallow a sword or put her legs behind her head you know, because at least that's a trade. I mean the first two are, I don't know about putting the legs um, behind your head, but the point is that I'm an idiot and I'm a hypocrite and I really miss you.",1
MAX,Do you want to come in ?,1
LORELAI,,1
LANE,"Wow, this is unbelievable. My wedding won't be this big.",1
RORY,Yeah.,1

MADELINE,But -,1
LOUISE,"Madeline, you are not confused. Think. Process. Focus.",1
MADELINE,Oh! Bye!,1
LOUISE,Later Paris.,1
PARIS,No glove no love.,1
LOUISE,Lovely.,1
PARIS,So I didn't think you were much of a party girl.,1
RORY,I'm not usually but I thought I might come by and check it out.,1
PARIS,Same exac t people we see at school except now we get to see them dance. So where is your boyfriend?,1
RORY,"We, um, we broke up.",1
PARIS,Oh. Well at least you had a boyfriend for a while.,1
RORY,"So do you know, um, which way would lead us to some soda?",1
PARIS,Keep up because I'm not turning around.,1
LANE,"Wow, you didn't exaggerate.",1
RORY,Paris needs no embellishments.,1
LANE,All this soda is French.,1
PARIS,"Madeline's mother has a French fetish. She's obsessed with all things French. French wine, French food, French water, French cellulite products.",1
TRISTIN,Look why won't you answer me?,1
SUMMERory,Because you didn't say 'please'.,1
TRISTIN,Summer .,1
SUMMERory,Can we do this later? There's a party going on.,1

TRISTIN,Summer please.,1
SUMMERory,"Ooh, good song.",1
PARIS,I just love that Summer don't you? 9:45.,1
RORY,Why do you keep checking your watch?,1
PARIS,My mom says I have to stay until 10:30.,1
RORY,Why would she care?,1
PARIS,She thinks I'm not enough of a people person. Shocking huh?,1
RORY,I'm floored.,1
PARIS,"Yeah well, I doubt highly that Madam Curie was voted most likely to dress like Jennifer Lopez.",1
RORY,You want to be a scientist?,1
PARIS,Cancer research.,1
RORY,Cool.,1
PARIS,Yeah.,1
LANE,Oh no.,1
RORY,What?,1
LANE,It just figures that the only Korean boy at this party has his Korean girl radar turned on.,1
HENRY,Hi.,1
LANE,Hi.,1
HENRY,I'm Henry.,1
LANE,I'm Lane. This is Rory and Paris.,1
PARIS,We've met.,1
HENRY,Paris. So would you like to dance?,1
LANE,Oh well we're talking here.,1
HENRY,"Oh yeah, but I mean one dance? You can put the conversation on hold for one dance right? Unless this is a mid-east peace talk kind of conversation.",1
LANE,One dance.,1
HENRY,A short one. No crazy dance mixes.,1
LANE,Ok.,1
HENRY,Thank you.,1
LANE,If I'm not back in one dance you're coming down with a really bad case of anything that means we had to go home.,1
RORY,Whoa is it getting warm here or is it just me?,1
LANE,Thank you.,1
PARIS,,1
LORELAI,"Just in case this comes up later, I did not come here for this.",1
MAX,"Ok, go it.",1
LORELAI,Ok.,1
MAX,Oh this is crazy!,1
LORELAI,"No it is, it's nuts. It's nuts.",1
MAX,I mean I don't see you for months and then all of a sudden -,1
LORELAI,Ding-dong Avon lady.,1
MAX,It's insane.,1
LORELAI,Completely. You do that so good.,1
MAX,"Ok, we've got to get a grip here.",1
LORELAI,I thought that's what we were doing.,1
MAX,You know you're going to sit over there on that couch.,1
LORELAI,Fine.,1
MAX,And I'm gonna sit here on this - on this chair...far away from the couch. And I'm gonna put this table right in between us just like that. Good. Ok. And we're gonna sit here and talk about this calmly.,1
LORELAI,Sounds good.,1
MAX,How you been?,1
LORELAI,"Good, really good.",1
MAX,Oh you look really good.,1
LORELAI,So do you.,1
MAX,I missed you.,1
LORELAI,Oh I'm glad. Otherwise that greeting there would've been a little innappropriate.,1
MAX,"You know actually, I've been thinking about us lately.",1
LORELAI,You have?,1
MAX,Haven't you?,1
LORELAI,No.,1
MAX,No?,1
LORELAI,No. I haven't given it any thought at all.,1
MAX,I'm flattered.,1
LORELAI,"No, I needed not to give it any thought at all otherwise I would give it too much thought and that would be hard and so I just didn't deal. Like mother like daughter I guess.",1
MAX,Oh I understand.,1
LORELAI,"So, with all the thought you've been giving it, have you come up with any great solutions?",1
MAX,No. You're still Rory's mom and I'm still her teacher and we're still us. I got nothing.,1
LORELAI,Oh.,1
MAX,Yeah.,1
LORELAI,So nothing's changed.,1
MAX,Nothing's changed.,1
LORELAI,So I guess my coming here was probably a bad idea.,1
MAX,,1
RORY,Hey am I sick yet?,1
LANE,Not yet. It actually might just be allergies.,1
RORY,Keep me posted.,1
PARIS,"My watched stopped, what time is it?",1

SUMMERory,Tristin stop it.,1

SUMMERory,Stop yelling.,1
TRISTIN,Summer please. Can we just go?,1
SUMMERory,No.,1
TRISTIN,Please.,1
SUMMERory,No. I'm sick of fighting with you. I'm sick of hearing 20 times a day  You're my girlfriend'.,1
TRISTIN,Ok could we possibly do this somewhere were a roomful of people aren't staring at us?,1
SUMMERory,I think we should break up.,1
TRISTIN,"Ok, I really want to go outside and talk about this.",1
SUMMERory,"Then go, bye.",1
TRISTIN,Summer come on!,1
LANE,I have a major problem.,1
RORY,What?,1
LANE,"Henry, the guy I've been dancing with?",1
RORY,Yeah?,1
LANE,"Ok so he's really good in school, he's going to be a doctor - pediatrician to be exact, his parents are extremely involved in their local church. He himself helps out with Sunday school. He speaks Korean fluently, he respects his parents and he's also really cute, very funny and surprisingly interesting.",1
RORY,"Lane I'm sorry, but I'm totally failing to see the problem here.",1
LANE,"I'm falling for a guy my parents would approve of! They'd love him, they'd go crazy! There'd be dancing in the Kim house! Dancing!",1
RORY,Really?,1
LANE,Followed by a lot of praying but initially there'd be dancing. This is horrible. This can't happen. I have to stop it. We have to go.,1
RORY,But uh -,1
LANE,"No now! You need to grab your stuff, we gotta go.",1
RORY,"Ok, yeah, ok. Whatever you say.",1
HENRY,Hey.,1
LANE,"Henry, hi.",1
HENRY,Sorry I've been monopolizing Lane all night.,1
RORY,"Oh no, that's ok. I've had her for 15 years. I'm actually a little sick of her.",1
LANE,Thank you.,1
RORY,Yeah you're welcome. Um we should go.,1
HENRY,Oh you're going?,1
LANE,Oh well -,1
RORY,Yeah. I have to get home - I have a very strict mother.,1
HENRY,"Oh wow, sorry about that. You couldn't even stay for one more dance huh?",1
RORY,Yeah I don't think that -,1
LANE,Yes.,1
RORY,Excuse me?,1
LANE,One dance would be fine.,1
HENRY,Great.,1
RORY,But -,1
LANE,,1
LORELAI,Well I certainly did not come over here for that.,1
MAX,I know.,1
LORELAI,You are a wonderful man.,1
MAX,I know. So...what happens now.,1
LORELAI,I don't know. It's late. I have to get Sookie's car back.,1
MAX,"Whoa, whoa, whoa wait a second. So this is it? You leave and we forget that this ever happened?",1
LORELAI,No.,1
MAX,Then what?,1
LORELAI,I leave and we go on with our lives and then at some point we buy some soup.,1
MAX,Lorelai...,1
LORELAI,What? Soup is good food.,1
MAX,Stop.,1
LORELAI,I don't want to leave here and forget this ever happened. I want to think of a solution that will make everything better. And I've been wracking my brain for an idea. Hence the babbling about soup being good food. But I can't think of anything.,1
MAX,I think we should talk.,1
LORELAI,What?,1
MAX,On the phone - you and me ab out us on a regular basis.,1
LORELAI,But -,1
MAX,We are not going to solve this staying away from each other.,1
LORELAI,No we're not.,1
MAX,And obviously we're not going to solve this by not staying away from each other.,1
LORELAI,But we'll burn more calories.,1
MAX,I want to solve this.,1
LORELAI,So do I.,1
MAX,So we'll talk?,1
LORELAI,We'll talk. Hey I thought we were supposed to be talking.,1
MAX,,1
RORY,Oh sorry.,1

TRISTIN,About what?,1
RORY,About you and Summer .,1

RORY,Ok. How'd you do on that biology test?,1
TRISTIN,What?,1
RORY,The test. It was hard wasn't it?,1
TRISTIN,Yeah it was hard.,1
RORY,I got a B+,1
TRISTIN,What are you doing?,1
RORY,Talking about the test.,1
TRISTIN,Why?,1
RORY,Because you said you didn't want to talk about Summer.,1
TRISTIN,I don't.,1
RORY,"Ok, so I moved to biology. Sorry did you want to talk about spanish?",1
TRISTIN,"You just loved it, didn't you?",1

TRISTIN,Yeah well. I am sorry.,1
RORY,I accept your apology.,1
TRISTIN,"Oh man, it's a great party huh?",1
RORY,Yeah not bad. It gave me a c hance to catch up on my reading.,1
TRISTIN,"You are very odd, you know that?",1
RORY,Thank you.,1
TRISTIN,"You're welcome. I'm sorry, what did I do? Did I bite your lip or something?",1

Do you know that every night at dinner, the Kennedy clan would sit around the table having lively debates about everything under the sun? They would quiz each other about current events, historical facts, intellectual trivia. Now the Gilmore clan is just as smart and worldly as the Kennedy's so come on - somebody - say something.",1

LORELAI,Whoa! Stupid naked angel butts? What did David Manic just stop by.,1
GRANDMA,Leave please.,1
LORELAI,Mom calm down.,1
GRANDMA,"I can't calm down! That lamp shade is missing, the china is cracked and I can't rememb er which table it is that she gave us for our 10 year anniversary!",1
LORELAI,"Mother, Grandma is a very old woman, I highly doubt that she's going to remember everything she ever bought you.",1
GRANDMA,She will rememb er down to the very last shrimp fork and do you know why?,1
LORELAI,No. Do you guys know why?,1
GRANDMA,"Because she doesn't just give you a present, she  gives' you a present and she tells you where to put it, how to use it, what it costs - for insurance purposes of course - and God forbid you should have a different opinion or you don't think it works in the space or you just get tired of waking up every morning with those horrifying animals staring at you!",1
LORELAI,She's just upset.,1
GRANDMA,Stop talking to the dogs!,1

RORY,So tell me mo re about her.,1
LORELAI,I don't really know that much.,1
RORY,Well you know more than I do.,1
LORELAI,"Well let's see. She moved to London when Grandpa died but she didn't like to travel so once a year Mom and Dad would go to visit her, usually leaving me behind, much to my relief by the way, and that's it. The rest I know from stories just like you.",1
RORY,Grandpa says I remind him of her.,1
LORELAI,That is the biggest compliment that can be wrenched out of Grumpy McFarlen believe me.,1

RORY,I hope she and Grandma get along.,1

PARIS,"I think that the basic structure of the Elizabethan government is relatively sound. The division of power between the monarchy, the privy council and the parliament all seem to work. Agreed?",1
MADELINE,Agreed.,1
LOUISE,Ditto.,1
PARIS,"Ok, so in establishing our own government, I think duplicating a similar structure would be good, with a few alterations. Queen Elizabeth chose to remain unwed. She took on the burden of leadership all by herself at a time w hen possibly marrying the Prince of France or the King of Spain would solidify her thrown while expanding her empire. And though it obviously worked for her, and the concept of a woman ruling without man is certainly politically correct these days, I think we need to take a different tact. I think we need to devise a nation with a truly solidified royal alliance...",1
MADELINE,She does know this is a make belief government right?,1
LOUISE,"You ask her, I'm afraid.",1
PARIS,"So in addition to the different political branches, we'll also need a King and Queen. Rory, Tristin, what about you?",1
TRISTIN,Us?,1
RORY,Oh.,1
TRISTIN,No.,1
RORY,"Yes, no.",1
PARIS,Why?,1
TRISTIN,Because..,1
RORY,I just don't want to be queen.,1
TRISTIN,Me either King - I don't want to be king.,1
RORY,What about you? You be queen.,1
PARIS,I'm going to be head of Parliament. I can't be queen.,1
RORY,Be both.,1
PARIS,I can't be both.,1
RORY,Why not? It's our government.,1
PARIS,It's not done that way.,1
RORY,"It can be though, let's vote.",1
PARIS,Rory.,1
RORY,Henry VIII started a new church when the old one wouldn't allow divorce.,1
PARIS,He also cut off his wife's head. Is he still your role model?,1
RORY,I'm just saying we have the opportunity to make any kind of government we want here.,1
PARIS,Why won't you be queen?,1
MADELINE,I'll be queen.,1
RORY,"There, make Madeline queen.",1
PARIS,"Fine, you're queen, Tristin's king.",1
LOUISE,I'll be the lady-in-waiting. The one with the low-cut blue velvet renaissance dress.,1
PARIS,Lady-in-waiting is not a political office.,1
LOUISE,No but they get all the sex.,1
PARIS,What?,1
LOUISE,Watch a movie.,1
PARIS,We are talking about government class not the movies. God why can't I get one person to care about this as much as I do?!,1
LOUISE,"Ok fine. I'll be the head of the Quarter Sessions court, but I'm still wearing the dress. Happy?",1
PARIS,"Out of my mind. Ok, so, I secured us the class room to work tomorrow and Sunday so that by Monday we'll be ready.",1
MADELINE,We're working all weekend?,1
LOUISE,You're kidding.,1
PARIS,"Take this. It's an outline for the entire system - point of methods, some basic laws and penalties plus some random ideas. Please be ready to discuss it tomorrow 9:00 in the morning, don't be late.",1
MADELINE,"Wow, she designed the flag.",1
PARIS,Question.,1
RORY,Ok.,1
PARIS,What's up with you and Tristin?,1
RORY,What do you mean?,1
PARIS,You just seem weird around each other.,1
RORY,"Nope, no weirder than usual.",1
PARIS,I disagree.,1
RORY,You usually do.,1
PARIS,I just think it's strange that you don't wanna be queen.,1
RORY,"You know, not all girls want to be queen Paris. Even Barbie ended up being a stewardess.",1
PARIS,"Ok, if you say so. Read my manifesto, I want your thoughts.",1
RORY,First thought - lose the word  manifesto'.,1
PARIS,Too cabin-in-the-woods?,1
RORY,Don't open your mail.,1
PARIS,Right. How about doctrine?,1
RORY,Better.,1
PARIS,"Ok, see you tomorrow.",1
RORY,Bye.,1
TRISTIN,Uh...you left this,1
RORY,Oh yeah I did. Thanks.,1
TRISTIN,Sure.,1
RORY,"Well, that could have been a potential Marx Brothers moment.",1
TRISTIN,You go first.,1
RORY,Ok. I think we need to talk.,1
TRISTIN,About what?,1
RORY,Tristin you know about what?,1
TRISTIN,No I don't.,1
RORY,"Look, we have a lot of work ahead of us. We also have about two and a half years of being in the same school. I don't want things to be weird between us. Don't you think it'd be good to at least try to talk about this?",1
TRISTIN,Ok.,1
RORY,Good. I'm gonna go first.,1
TRISTIN,,1
LORELAI,Ugh! It's still not working.,1
MICHELorelai,Well you did something wrong.,1
LORELAI,I didn't do anything wrong. I did the same thing I always do when I'm pulling up reservations for the upcoming month but nothing happened.,1
MICHELorelai,You typed in the name?,1
LORELAI,I typed in the name.,1
MICHELorelai,You clicked on the April 5?,1
LORELAI,I clicked on the April 5.,1
MICHELorelai,You double clicked on confirmation?,1
LORELAI,I double clicked.,1
MICHELorelai,Are you sure?,1
LORELAI,Yes I double clicked.,1
MICHELorelai,You clicked twice.,1
LORELAI,No I double clicked but I didn't click twice.,1
MICHELorelai,Because to successfully double click you must click twice.,1
LORELAI,I know what double click is.,1
MICHELorelai,Well apparently you do not or we wouldn't be having this conversation.,1
LORELAI,"Ooh, I'm going to pinch you so hard right now.",1
MICHELorelai,Well I don't know what you have done!,1
LORELAI,Well - ah!,1
MICHELorelai,Well I can't fix it if you don't move.,1
LORELAI,"I double clicked. Ooh, what's that?",1
MICHELorelai,What?,1
LORELAI,That flashy red thing with an  x' through it.,1
MICHELorelai,I do not know.,1
LORELAI,"Ooh, it happened when you pushed something funky.",1
MICHELorelai,I pushed nothing  funky'.,1
LORELAI,You have the funk my friend. Independence Inn.,1
GRANDMA,I need the hat rack.,1
LORELAI,The fish flies at night.,1
GRANDMA,What?,1
LORELAI,"I don't know, who is this?",1
GRANDMA,This is your mother.,1
LORELAI,"Oh well hi Mom, I didn't recognize your voice.",1
GRANDMA,I need the hat rack back.,1
LORELAI,What hat rack?,1
GRANDMA,The hat rack I gave you.,1
LORELAI,What hat rack?,1
GRANDMA,The hat rack I gave you for Christmas five years ago.,1
LORELAI,"Uh, well...",1
GRANDMA,"It's large, bronze with dragons or weasels - I don't know, some sort of lizard type animal that you hang your coats on.",1
LORELAI,"Yes, yes, I rememb er it.",1
GRANDMA,Thank God. I need it back.,1
LORELAI,You need a Christmas present back?,1
GRANDMA,Temporarily.,1
LORELAI,Why Mom?,1
GRANDMA,I need it back because Richard's mother gave it to us and she'll notice if it's not there.,1
LORELAI,You gave me a u sed present?,1
GRANDMA,"No, we never used it.",1
LORELAI,I can't believe it.,1
GRANDMA,You'll get it back.,1
LORELAI,"You gave me a s econd hand present, like something you got at the junk store.",1
GRANDMA,You're being a little dramatic. It was still in the crate.,1
LORELAI,"You actually went  Huh, what should I get Lorelai this year. You know what, I can't be bothered. Let's give her something we don't want anymore.'",1
GRANDMA,You're not funny.,1
LORELAI,What would Miss Manners say about this?,1
GRANDMA,"If she met your grandmother she'd understand. Now please, just bring the rack with you when you come tonight ok?",1
LORELAI,"Ok, sure.",1
GRANDMA,Thank you.,1
LORELAI,,1
CHILTONTRISTIN,So we're supposed to talk.,1
RORY,Yeah. Look about the other night.,1
TRISTIN,"Look, I was upset over Summer.",1
RORY,Yes and I was upset over Dean.,1
TRISTIN,"So, then it doesn't mean anything right?",1
RORY,Right.,1
TRISTIN,"So then - right, so then that's it. We just chalk it up to a bad night.",1
RORY,Ok. I'm sorry I cried.,1
TRISTIN,No problem.,1
RORY,I swear it had nothing to do with the kiss.,1
TRISTIN,"I kissed you, you cried. That had to do something with the kiss.",1
RORY,"No, I cried because I was confused. Because I hadn't cried. I didn't cry because of the kiss. It was a nice kiss.",1
TRISTIN,Yeah?,1
RORY,Very nice. Not at all crying material.,1
TRISTIN,Really?,1
RORY,Absolutely.,1
TRISTIN,Wanna try it again?,1
RORY,Well I think someone's recovering from their heartbreak just fine.,1
TRISTIN,Yeah I'm all better. I think I'm going to swear off girls for a while.,1
RORY,Ha!,1
TRISTIN,What?,1
RORY,"Uh, sorry, nothing. You said you were going to swear off girls - it's funny.",1
TRISTIN,You don't think I can?,1
RORY,"No I think you can, I just think it would be hard for you. It'd probably involve some kind of lock up facility, one of those Hannibal Lector masks.",1
TRISTIN,"Ok yes, it would be hard but not impossible.",1
RORY,Maybe it's not so much swearing off all girls but swearing off a certain kind of girl.,1
TRISTIN,Meaning?,1
RORY,"Meaning next time may be you should pick a girl with a little more substance. You know, a girl who's smart and is driven and has ambition. You know like Paris.",1
TRISTIN,Are you serious?,1
RORY,Yeah why not? Paris is smart and cute and interesting and yes she does bring her own unique set of baggage into the mix.,1
TRISTIN,A matching set.,1
RORY,But she likes you. She's crazy about you. She thinks you're amazing.,1
TRISTIN,You want me to date Paris?,1
RORY,Just think about it.,1
TRISTIN,Me and Paris.,1
RORY,"Louis, I think this is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.",1
TRISTIN,Who's Louis?,1
RORY,,1
LORELAI,"Come on, let's go.",1
RORY,"Relax, I'm almost ready.",1
LORELAI,We're gonna be late.,1
RORY,No we're not.,1
LORELAI,Well it's Friday night and traffic's bad on Friday night.,1
RORY,Since when?,1
LORELAI,Since the beginning of time. Here let me do that.,1
RORY,What's up with you?,1
LORELAI,Nothing.,1
RORY,You've been ready and bugging me for almost an hour. Usually I have to drag you out of here kicking and screaming to go to dinner.,1
LORELAI,Now then.,1
RORY,"You whine, you complain, you act like a child.",1
LORELAI,I do not.,1
RORY,I had to pay you five bucks once so you wouldn't go in sweats.,1
LORELAI,"Make your point and make it fast, as we move quickly to the front door.",1
RORY,My point is that you are mean.,1
LORELAI,I am not mean.,1
RORY,"You are. You want to go to dinner to see Grandma uncomfortable, that's mean.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, ok, look. I will admit, I work very hard and sometimes I am a little tired come Friday night for the Gilmore family dinner. But I had a light day today and my grandmother who I have not seen for years is going to be there.",1
RORY,And it has nothing to do with the fact that Grandma hates Great-grandma?,1
LORELAI,Not at all.,1
RORY,And when you see Grandma miserable and uncomfortable you're going to be sad and sympathetic?,1
LORELAI,Not at all.,1
RORY,Mean.,1
LORELAI,I'm kidding.,1
RORY,I want you to be nice.,1
LORELAI,I will be nice.,1
RORY,And no outward reveling in someone else's pain.,1
LORELAI,"I promise, internal reveling only.",1
RORY,"Ok then, we can go.",1
LORELAI,Ok good. Oh wait So the internal reveling can continue for years to come.,1
RORY,Mean.,1
LORELAI,,1
RORY,,1
RORY,"God, this thing weighs like a 1000 pounds.",1
LORELAI,"I know, I know. Here, put down.",1
RORY,What are we doing?,1
LORELAI,"Well, in case Gran comes to the door you know.",1
RORY,Good thinking.,1
LORELAI,I mean she's 80. The eyes have got to be gone right?,1
RORY,Let's just try to keep her inside the house.,1
LORELAI,Good thinking,1
GRANDMA,Do you have it?,1
LORELAI,We got it.,1
GRANDMA,"Hurry up, bring it in here.",1
LORELAI,Ah!,1
RORY,Sorry.,1
GRANDMA,"Ok, quiet, be quiet.",1
LORELAI,"Ok mom, thanks for the direction and all but, um, we need some help.",1
GRANDMA,Oh yeah sorry.,1
LORELAI,Careful honey.,1
GRANDMA,"Watch it, watch your head. Get it over here. Ok yes, yeah I think that was about - no I think it was maybe a little more on the left. Oh God I should have put tape down.",1
LORELAI,"Mom, you don't think that the coat rack could've moved a quarter of an inch in five years?",1
GRANDMA,"Yeah you're right. That's it. Ok, put your coats on it.",1
LORELAI,How'd you get her in here without her noticing it wasn't there?,1
GRANDMA,"Well I brought her in through the back way then I had Stella wax the floors, also she napped so that took up about an hour.",1
RORY,Where is she now?,1
GRANDMA,In the living room scratching the diamond pendant I bought her against a mirror.,1
LORELAI,So we shouldn't keep her waiting huh?,1
GRANDMA,"No you're right, we shouldn't. Oh, heaven help me!",1
RORY,Stop.,1
GRANDMA,"Mom, look who's here?",1
TRIX,Who?,1
GRANDMA,"Well, look.",1
TRIX,"If I wanted to look, I would look. I haven't looked therefore you must draw your own conclusions. Ah, thank you, dear boy.",1
GRANDPA,You're welcome Trix.,1
RORY,Trix?,1
LORELAI,Dad's pet name for Gran.,1
GRANDMA,Isn't it just darling?,1
LORELAI,Hi Gran.,1
TRIX,Lorelai.,1
LORELAI,"Yes, it's so good to see you again.",1
GRANDPA,"Trix, this is Rory. You haven't met her yet.",1
TRIX,"No, I don't believe I have.",1
RORY,Hello.,1
TRIX,Come. I want to get a very good look at both of you. They're tall.,1
GRANDPA,Well yes they are.,1
TRIX,How's your health?,1
LORELAI,"Oh, good.",1
RORY,Very healthy.,1
LORELAI,Mm-hmm.,1
TRIX,Good. That means that the majority of your blood is Gilmore blood. Gilmore's don't get sick. Am I right Richard?,1
GRANDPA,Oh we wouldn't dare Trix.,1
TRIX,That's right. Your mother is always sick.,1
GRANDMA,I'm hardly always sick.,1
TRIX,You're sick right now.,1
LORELAI,Are you sick now Mom?,1
GRANDMA,Headache.,1
TRIX,"Gilmore's don't have headaches, our heads are perfect. You don't drink?",1
LORELAI,"Uh, well...",1
TRIX,"Emily, get this woman a drink.",1
GRANDPA,Oh I'll do it.,1
LORELAI,Oh thanks Dad. White wine.,1
GRANDMA,I'm going to go get the hors d'ouevres.,1
TRIX,So you're Rory.,1
RORY,Yes ma'am.,1
TRIX,My son speaks of you constantly. He seems very fond of you.,1
RORY,Oh well I'm very fond of him too.,1
GRANDPA,This little girl is as smart as a whip Mom. I think she has a great deal of you in her.,1
TRIX,Really?,1
GRANDPA,Mm-hmm.,1
TRIX,How nice. Is this cheese?,1
GRANDMA,Yes it is.,1
TRIX,Am I supposed to eat that cheese?,1
GRANDMA,Well only if you like.,1
GRANDPA,"Emily, where are those spiced nuts that Trix likes so much?",1
GRANDMA,I'll get some.,1
TRIX,"So Lorelai, since I've seen you last, you've grown up, gotten pregnant out of wedlock, raised a child and still haven't bothered to get married. Have I left anything out?",1
LORELAI,"Well sometime in between growing up and getting pregnant, I got my ears pierced.",1
TRIX,"I've always hated a scandal. However I've always appreciated self-sufficiency. Tell me, how do you support this child?",1
LORELAI,I run an inn.,1
TRIX,Hard work?,1
LORELAI,Yes it is.,1
TRIX,Good. Hard work is good for a woman - makes her stronger. I admire people who enjoy hard work.,1
GRANDMA,"Here we go, spiced nuts.",1
TRIX,Thank you Emily. I suppose I can just put these nuts in my hand.,1
GRANDMA,I'll be right back.,1
LORELAI,"So Gran, um, when was the last time I saw you?",1
TRIX,"You were still in your teens, wild hair flying everywhere. I see you've taken care of that.",1
LORELAI,"Yes, I joined a support group, bought a hair brush and just taking it one day at a time.",1
TRIX,That was a joke?,1
LORELAI,Yes it is.,1
TRIX,Very good.,1
LORELAI,Thank you.,1
GRANDMA,I have dishes and napkins.,1
TRIX,"Good for you. Richard, I would like to be escorted into the dining room now.",1
GRANDPA,Your wish is my comman d.,1
GRANDMA,"Well, uh, I'm not sure that dinner is ready just yet.",1
TRIX,"Well perhaps our presence in the dining room will teach your help that when one is told dinner is at 7:00, people often expects dinner at 7:00.",1
GRANDMA,But it's only five after Mom.,1
TRIX,"Only five after? Richard, in the even that I am kidnapped and a ransom is demanded at a certain time, I would prefer that Emily not be in charge of the drop off.",1
RORY,"Grandma, this dinner's delicious.",1
TRIX,"Very good young lady, well all believe you. Now, let's talk about your education. Where are you attending school?",1
RORY,Chilton.,1
GRANDPA,Rory is in the top ten percent of her class.,1
GRANDMA,We're very proud of our Rory. She's going to Harvard.,1
TRIX,Harvard?,1
RORY,Yes ma'am.,1
TRIX,"Richard, how can you allow this girl to go to Harvard?!",1
GRANDPA,Now Trix -,1
TRIX,"You're a Yale man, your father was a Yale man!",1
LORELAI,Well we want Rory to be whatever kind of man she wants to be.,1
TRIX,That's enough jokes for this evening Lorelai.,1
LORELAI,Sorry.,1
TRIX,"Now if you don't mind my asking, Chilton is rather an expensive institution, I'm curious how the manager of an inn can afford such a luxury?",1
LORELAI,Ah well...,1
GRANDMA,We're helping Lorelai out a little.,1
GRANDPA,"Yes, we've seen to it that Rory's education is taken care of.",1
LORELAI,But it's temporary. It's a loan. I plan to pay them back every cent. They know this.,1
TRIX,"That's it, I'm done. Richard. Tomorrow, Rory, I shall plan the menu. When you've lived in Europe you learn a thing or two about food.",1
RORY,"Oh, I can't. I'm studying tomorrow. I'm in a study group and our presentation is due on Monday",1
TRIX,"Oh very well, your mother can tell you all about it.",1
LORELAI,"I will, I promise.",1
GRANDMA,Won't you have dessert?,1
TRIX,,1
LOUISE,What time is it?,1
MADELINE,It's almost nine. Hey maybe I'll own a magazine some day. Then I'll get all my nail polish for free.,1
LOUISE,I'm going back to sleep. Tell Paris I hate her.,1
MADELINE,Ok.,1
PARIS,Hi.,1
MADELINE,Hey Paris. Louise hates you.,1
PARIS,You'll thank me w hen you get into Sarah Lawrence.,1
LOUISE,Wanna bet?,1
RORY,Hey.,1
MADELINE,"Wow, did you bring coffee?",1
RORY,And doughnuts in the shape of clowns.,1
MADELINE,Hey they've got hats.,1
RORY,Well a clown just isn't a clown without a hat. Here is your decaf with soy milk.,1
PARIS,Thanks.,1
RORY,You're welcome. So I read your doctrine and I thing our imaginary kingdom is off to a pretty good start.,1
PARIS,Yeah?,1
RORY,Yeah. I mean the taxes are a little high and the landowner's power should be regulated a little more.,1
PARIS,It was a different time back then.,1
RORY,Yeah but the fundamental human needs were the same.,1
PARIS,We're supposed to set it up within -,1
LOUISE,"Ding, ding, ding. No debating until I've had coffee.",1
MADELINE,And a clown.,1
TRISTIN,Ladies.,1
MADELINE,Hi Tristin.,1
RORY,Hey.,1
TRISTIN,"Paris, can I talk to you for a sec?",1
LORELAI,"Oh, sure ok.",1
LOUISE,And that is about what pray tell?,1
MADELINE,I don't know. The project - maybe?,1
LOUISE,They could've talked project here. It's something else. Something private.,1
MADELINE,Scandal.,1
LOUISE,Maybe. Though it is Paris.,1
MADELINE,Scandal lite.,1
LOUISE,"All the taste, but much fewer calories.",1
MADELINE,We could spy.,1
RORY,Or we could wait for her to come back in to see if she wants us to know.,1
LOUISE,"Those who simply wait for information to find them, spend a lot of time sitting by the phone. Those who go out and find it themselves, have something to say when it rings.",1
RORY,Nietzsche?,1
LOUISE,Dawson.,1
RORY,My next guess.,1
LOUISE,"So, what was with the confab in the hallway?",1
MADELINE,We're dying here.,1
PARIS,"Well, Tristin, he...asked me out.",1
MADELINE,No!,1
LOUISE,"My, my, my.",1
MADELINE,"Wow, this is amazing. God I'm jealous.",1
LOUISE,"Details please. Don't leave out anything. We want every comma, apostrophe and ampersand.",1
PARIS,Well he just asked me out.,1
MADELINE,When?,1
PARIS,Tonight.,1
LOUISE,Hmm.,1
PARIS,What?,1
LOUISE,Nothing.,1
PARIS,"No, you  hmm'ed. Why did you  hmm'?",1
LOUISE,Forget it.,1
PARIS,Louise tell me w hy you  hmm'ed.,1
LOUISE,He asked you out for tonight.,1
MADELINE,Less than 24 hours notice.,1
PARIS,So? What does that mean?,1
LOUISE,Usually that someone else cancelled.,1
RORY,Or maybe he just got up the nerve to ask her out.,1
MADELINE,Maybe.,1
LOUISE,This is so amazing. I mean you are so far from Tristin's type.,1
MADELINE,"So, so far.",1
LOUISE,Tristin usually likes his girls bad.,1
MADELINE,Looks like we're going to have to do the Pink Ladies makeover on you.,1
LOUISE,"We'll turn you from a sweet Sandy to a sluty Sandy. Dancing at the school fair with high heels, black spandex and permed hair.",1
MADELINE,You can borrow my water bra.,1
PARIS,Excuse me?,1
MADELINE,My water bra. It's like a padded bra but it's filled with some sort of liquid so it moves.,1
PARIS,It moves?,1
MADELINE,Yeah.,1
PARIS,On it's own?,1
MADELINE,It makes you look natural.,1
PARIS,"Great. Thanks, but I'll pass. Everyone come on, let's get to work.",1
RORY,I think you're gonna have a really good time.,1
PARIS,"Yeah well, it's just a date right?",1
RORY,"Oh, right.",1
PARIS,"Ok, focus people.",1
RORY,,1
LORELAI,"Hi! Five minute talking break while I change. My day - big leak third floor, lots of things going squish that should not be squishing. Michel is not help. And now I'm late for dinner which by the way I'm completely bummed you're not coming to - which one - blue, black, good, bad?",1
RORY,Black.,1
LORELAI,Ok. Are you sure you can't come?,1
RORY,"Yeah I'm sure. If I'm not prepared tomorrow, Paris is gonna have me sent to the Tower. Although if things go well tonight, I bet it'll help tomorrow.",1
LORELAI,Tonight?,1
RORY,"Yeah, she's going out on a date with Tristin.",1
LORELAI,How'd that happen?,1
RORY,I did a little matchmaking.,1
LORELAI,"Lucy, how many times have I told you not to butt into there people's business?",1
RORY,Never.,1
LORELAI,Good going.,1
RORY,That's all.,1
LORELAI,"Alright, well I want details tomorrow now how do I look?",1
RORY,Beautiful.,1
LORELAI,Ok. My five minutes are up. Let's go. There is money on the kitchen table and there's really good chocolate cake that I took out and defrosted for you specially this morning and call me if you need me and I'll be home early and what else?,1
RORY,Don't be mean to Grandma.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, yeah broken record. Ok, I'm gone.",1
RORY,Be good.,1
LORELAI,Bye.,1
RORY,Bye.,1
PARIS,I don't know what to wear.,1
RORY,Ever?,1
PARIS,On my date with Tristin. I'm not trendy girl ok? I don't haunt the boutiques hoping to find that one fabulous little top. I study and then I think about studying and then I study some more.,1
RORY,Do you want to come in ?,1
PARIS,I only have one lipstick at home ok? And it's barely even a color. You put it on and it looks like you're not wearing anything which is why I liked it in the first place. But to date you need the fabulous little top and you need a lipstick that you can actually tell you're wearing.,1
RORY,Do you want to put that stuff down?,1
PARIS,You said once that if I ever needed to talk to anymore I could come talk to you.,1
RORY,Yes I did.,1
PARIS,Well here I am.,1
RORY,"Ok, can I ask you a question?",1
PARIS,Ok.,1
RORY,Why didn't you go to Madeline or Louise about this? I mean they seem to get that  fabulous little top' thing.,1
PARIS,Oh yeah that they get. The whole supportive  You're going to be fine and not throw up 12times on the way to his car' thing - that they don't get.,1
RORY,"Ok, let's just see what you got.",1
PARIS,I brought everything just in case there was some sort of hidden potential in something that I just didn't see. So?,1
RORY,Well you'd be one well dressed widow.,1
PARIS,Forget it. I'm not going.,1
RORY,Yes you are. Come on now. This is your entire wardrobe?,1
PARIS,Yes.,1
RORY,Nothing's left at home.,1
PARIS,Nothing but my Chilton uniform and my bat mitzvah dress which has menorahs on the collar.,1
RORY,Ok let's think. Come on.,1
PARIS,Where are you going?,1
RORY,to our one stop shopping store.,1
PARIS,Is this your mother's room?,1
RORY,Yes it is.,1
PARIS,I can't wear your mother's clothes.,1
RORY,"Yes you can, I do it all the time. What about this?",1
PARIS,My mother says the color pink makes my head look small.,1
RORY,"Ok, no pink.",1
PARIS,This whole thing is so insane.,1
RORY,Why?,1
PARIS,Tristin asking me out? Why would he do that?,1
RORY,Why would he not do that?,1
PARIS,Because he's gorgeous and experienced and only dates those most likely to become a trophy wife.,1
RORY,Tristin would be lucky to go out with someone like you. He's not going to have to read the menu to you or explain that the dancing trash bins in the movie theatre previews aren't real. It's going to be much less stressful.,1
PARIS,All these years I've hoped this would happen and now it has and I feel...I don't know. I don't have a lot of experience in the dating department. I mean if you can't put it on your transcriptwhat's the point right?,1
RORY,I know. Before Dean I'd never had a boyfriend. Or a kiss.,1
PARIS,Yeah.,1
RORY,I never even thought about dating.,1
PARIS,Then you met Dean.,1
RORY,Yeah. And he was so special and nice and made me completely nauseous.,1
PARIS,The best ones do.,1
RORY,I couldn't even talk around him.,1
PARIS,I saw you at the dance. You didn't seem to have any trouble talking. Or gazing annoyingly into each others eyes.,1
RORY,"But that was after we'd been dating a little. After we started going out and spending time together, I don't know, it just kind of got easier. And then by the third date everything was perfect.",1
PARIS,Do you miss him a lot?,1
RORY,"Yeah, a lot, a lot.",1
PARIS,Sorry.,1
RORY,Thanks. But tonight is not about me. Tonight is about you going out with Tristin in this outfit. What do you think?,1
PARIS,It's ok. It's great.,1
RORY,Put it on.,1
PARIS,Are you sure?,1
RORY,Yeah. Bathroom's down the hall and I'll get you a lipstick with some actual color in it.,1
PARIS,Ok.,1
RORY,"Uh, Paris. What are these cards that fell out of your jacket?",1
PARIS,Oh yeah. Those are notes for tonight.,1
RORY,Notes?,1
PARIS,Yeah. Just some reference points really - you know subjects to bring up in case the conversation lags.,1
RORY,Well can I suggest that you leave this one about the Spanish Inquisition out?,1
PARIS,It's not very romantic?,1
RORY,Not really.,1
PARIS,"Ok, I'm dressed.",1
RORY,How's it look?,1
PARIS,Bad.,1
RORY,Well I don't really trust your opinion on that subject so come out here please.,1
PARIS,Fine but it looks bad.,1
RORY,You look great!,1
PARIS,I feel weird.,1
RORY,Well then weird works for you because you look amazing.,1
PARIS,Really? You're not just saying that?,1
RORY,I swear to God.,1
PARIS,Are you atheist?,1
RORY,Excuse me?,1
PARIS,Because that affects the validity of your swearing to God.,1
RORY,You look great. And I wouldn't tell you you did if you didn't.,1
PARIS,"Ok, well if you think it looks ok.",1
RORY,I believe the word  amazing' was used.,1
PARIS,Then I'll wear it. Thanks.,1
RORY,Anytime.,1
PARIS,I have to go.,1
RORY,Lipstick.,1
PARIS,You're going to hold this evening over my head for the rest of my life aren't you?,1
RORY,Probably.,1
PARIS,,1
TRIX,What did you think about the rabbit?,1
LORELAI,"Oh, I thought it was wonderful.",1
TRIX,You know I brought it with me.,1
LORELAI,Excuse me?,1
TRIX,From London. London has the best game.,1
GRANDPA,Mm.,1
LORELAI,You brought it with you from London?,1
TRIX,Yes.,1
LORELAI,"What, did you get it a seat?",1
GRANDMA,Dry ice.,1
LORELAI,Wow! That's inventive.,1
TRIX,Well it looks like we're finished here.,1
GRANDPA,Let's retire to the living room for a brandy.,1
TRIX,"Yes. Lorelai, walk with me. I have something that I want to discuss with you.",1
LORELAI,Ok.,1
TRIX,I've been thinking about something I heard the other night.,1
LORELAI,What was that?,1
TRIX,That you borrowed money from your parents for Rory's school.,1
LORELAI,Well if you're worried about them getting the money back -,1
TRIX,You know Shakespeare once wrote  Neither a borrower nor a lender be'. Do you consider Shakespeare a wise man?,1
LORELAI,"Uh, sure, yeah.",1
GRANDMA,We certainly don't mind loaning Lorelai the money if that's what you're worried about.,1
GRANDPA,Certainly not. Rory is first priority in this house.,1
TRIX,"I'm not concerned about whether you mind or not. Loaning money is a dirty business. It's distasteful and I don't care for it. As you know, I came into town to check up on the family investments and to talk with our lawyers. I have some things to put in order, and one of them is setting up a trust fund for Rory.",1
LORELAI,Wh - that's amazing. Really?,1
TRIX,"Now normally I would set up a fund that she would have access to when she's 25. However, considering the situation, if you like, I will arrange for her to get it now.",1
LORELAI,Now?!,1
GRANDMA,Now?!,1
TRIX,That way she can use it to pay for Chilton.,1
LORELAI,"Oh Gran, I don't know what to say, that is so generous of you.",1
GRANDPA,My mother is a very special woman isn't she?,1
TRIX,You talk about me like I'm dead.,1
GRANDPA,Oh you're never going to die! You're too stubborn!,1
LORELAI,Gran this is - I don't know what to say.,1
TRIX,Nothing now would be preferable. I have arranged for you and your mother and I to have tea tomorrow before I leave. Say it then. Good night Emily.,1
GRANDMA,Good night.,1
GRANDPA,"Well I'll just uh, walk mother upstairs and be right back.",1
LORELAI,Wow! That was quite a b*mb she just dropped.,1
GRANDMA,It certainly was.,1
LORELAI,"God! Um, I guess I should be going. Thanks for dinner Mom. I'll see you tomorrow.",1
GRANDMA,Lorelai... You're not honestly considering accepting that money are you?,1
LORELAI,"Um yeah, of course I'm considering it.",1
GRANDMA,I don't think that's very wise.,1
LORELAI,Why not?,1
GRANDMA,Because she's a young girl. She won't know the first thing about managing that money.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah, well, I'll help her.",1
GRANDMA,You don't know the first thing about managing that money either.,1
LORELAI,"No, but I've very familiar with the second thing.",1
GRANDMA,How can you not see the pitfalls in accepting that money?,1
LORELAI,Mom.,1
GRANDMA,I mean you're the one that brags about how special your relationship with Rory is. I'm stunned that you want to jeopardize it like this.,1
LORELAI,What are you talking about?,1
GRANDMA,Well you know as well as I do that money is freedom.,1
LORELAI,And?,1
GRANDMA,If Rory has that money she won't need you anymore.,1
LORELAI,"I don't know Mom, she's 16. There's still a couple of ways I might come in handy, you know buying the beer that kind of stuff.",1
GRANDMA,Well I'm glad you thing losing your daughter is so funny.,1
LORELAI,Mom.,1
GRANDMA,"She'll be self sufficient, she won't need you to pay for anything, she won't have to turn to you.",1
LORELAI,Everything in a relationship isn't about money mom.,1
GRANDMA,She'll move out as soon as she can.,1
LORELAI,So what.,1
GRANDMA,"She won't need your help to put her through college, she won't need you to buy a car.",1
LORELAI,Ok you know what? Say goodbye to Dad for me as soon as the voices in your head subside.,1
GRANDMA,Why should she wait to backpack around Europe with you? She could afford to go herself. And she could take a friend or a boyfriend or anyone.,1
LORELAI,Yeah well she wants to go with me.,1
GRANDMA,Well now of course she does she doesn't have options. But the minute you give her options...,1
LORELAI,"Ok, that's it. You're nuts and I'm going - in that order.",1
GRANDMA,,1
SOOKIE,That is amazing!,1
LORELAI,"I know. One minute it's  pass the pot roast' the next minute it's  hey, here's have a pile of money'. Things are never boring at the Gilmore house.",1
SOOKIE,What did Rory say when you told her?,1
LORELAI,I haven't told her yet.,1
SOOKIE,What?!,1
LORELAI,She was asleep when I got home.,1
SOOKIE,"Hi, for that much money you wake her up! You hire a singing telegram! Women jump out of cakes! People dress up like bankers and dance around with those toasters!",1
LORELAI,"Well she's been working her butt off all week on this Chilton paper, so I let her sleep and I'll tell her tonight.",1
SOOKIE,"Call her now. Ooh, page her, or page her and have her call my cell phone and we can sing the money song from  Cabaret'. You be Liza, I'll be Joel.",1
LORELAI,I don't know.,1
SOOKIE,Hey I'm Joel.,1
LORELAI,"I don't want to bother her while she's at school. I can never decide, carnations tacky or trendy?",1
SOOKIE,You don't want to tell her.,1
LORELAI,Yeah I do. I think.,1
SOOKIE,Oh well I understand the hesitation.,1
LORELAI,You do?,1
SOOKIE,Absolutely. I mean who wants to be the bearer of good news. All that hugging and happiness - nightmare.,1
LORELAI,"I was, I was thrilled when Gran told me about it and I was going to tell Rory about it right away.",1
SOOKIE,But?,1
LORELAI,My mother...,1
SOOKIE,Ah.,1
LORELAI,...cornered me by the door saying all this stuff about how when Rory gets the money she's not going to need me an d she's gonna move out of the house sooner.,1
SOOKIE,What? That's crazy!,1
LORELAI,"I know it is, it's crazy and yet...",1
SOOKIE,"Honey come on. The woman's just trying to mess with your mind, you know that.",1
LORELAI,I do.,1
SOOKIE,She just doesn't want to lose control of you. She wants you to be permanently obligated to her.,1
LORELAI,"I know, I know that.",1
SOOKIE,So then what? You don't believe what she said do you?,1
LORELAI,"I don't know. I mean you're right - what you're saying about she wants to mess with my mind and make me feel obligated but I mean, what if the money does change our relationship?",1
SOOKIE,Impossible.,1
LORELAI,Well anything's possible.,1
SOOKIE,Come on.,1
LORELAI,I couldn't stand that. I like things the way they are now.,1
SOOKIE,"Lorelai, this is Rory we're talking about.",1
LORELAI,I know.,1
SOOKIE,She's like the most unmaterialistic kid in the world.,1
LORELAI,"Not it's not about what she would buy. I don't care if she buys a house or a boat or the elephant man's bones. It's just that - you know, it's about the freedom. I mean if I had access to all that money as a kid I would have left the house so fast.",1
SOOKIE,Faster than 17?,1
LORELAI,No I mean - God I know this is crazy. I have my mother's voice stuck in my head. It's like that annoying Cranberries song. I hate that I let her do this! I have that I let her get to me!,1
SOOKIE,Well then don't let her. Call Rory and tell her about the money and you'll see that nothing will be any different.,1
LORELAI,I don't want her to go to Europe without me. That was going to be our thing.,1
SOOKIE,She's not going to go without you. I promise.,1
LORELAI,Hey - Aw! No! I've got to go home.,1
SOOKIE,Why? What are you doing?,1
LORELAI,I have to change and go to tea with Gran and the cast of  Gaslight'.,1
SOOKIE,"Wow, I'll see you later.",1
LORELAI,,1
GRANDPA,"You're hysterical, I can't talk to you when you're hysterical.",1
GRANDMA,Well you make me hysterical.,1
GRANDPA,I am tired of fighting about this.,1
GRANDMA,You have to got to get her to take that offer back.,1
GRANDPA,No.,1
GRANDMA,Richard Gilmore I have put up with a lot from this woman over the years...,1
GRANDPA,Keep your voice down.,1
GRANDMA,But this time she's gone too far!,1
GRANDPA,Emily please.,1
GRANDMA,I can go louder!,1
GRANDPA,"If I do as you ask, I'll be insulting my mother. I will not do that.",1
GRANDMA,"Now you listen to me. I don't care if she demeans me and looks down on me. I don't care if she thinks I've tarnished the Gilmore name. I don't care if she thinks I'm the whore of Babylon. I've long ago given up any hope of getting into her psychotic good graces, but that woman is horrible and selfish. And she's not going to get away with it. I won't let her.",1
GRANDPA,This is my mother you're talking about.,1
GRANDMA,"Yes it is. Your mother, the one who stepped in without being asked and single-handedly wrecked everything!",1
GRANDPA,"Emily, what is this about?",1
GRANDMA,She'll never come back here you know.,1
GRANDPA,"Who? Mother, of course she will she -",1
GRANDMA,Lorelai.,1
GRANDPA,What?,1
GRANDMA,"If she gets that money, Lorelai will never come back here. She won't have to.",1
TRIX,"I've ordered a car, women shouldn't drive. Are you ready?",1
GRANDMA,Yes I'm ready.,1
TRIX,,1
PARIS,Well aren't we early. Trying to suck up to Parliament?,1
RORY,Hey how'd it go last night?,1
PARIS,It went.,1
RORY,It went well?,1
PARIS,Well he picked me up. We went to dinner and a movie. I didn't use my note cards once and he kissed me good night.,1
RORY,Paris I'm so glad!,1
PARIS,It was a great kiss.,1
RORY,See? All that nervousness for nothing.,1
PARIS,Yeah. God this is so weird. I can't stop smiling.,1
RORY,"Good, then it's a good time to talk about our over taxed peasants.",1
PARIS,Oh let them eat cake.,1
TRISTIN,Hey.,1
RORY,Don't look at me. I didn't kiss you.,1
PARIS,Hi.,1
TRISTIN,Hey.,1
PARIS,I just wanted to tell you again that I had so much fun last night.,1
TRISTIN,"Yeah, after five messages on my answering machine, I kinda got that impression.",1
PARIS,"Too much, sorry.",1
TRISTIN,"No forget it, it was cute.",1
PARIS,"You know, maybe we could do it again sometime. I mean a different movie of course but the same basic plan.",1
TRISTIN,Absolutely.,1
PARIS,"Great, because it was really fun.",1
TRISTIN,It was fun and we should do it again. I mean you know - as friends.,1
PARIS,"Oh, yeah as friends.",1
TRISTIN,You noticed it too right? That we're sort of more friends material than dating material?,1
PARIS,Yes I did notice. I have excellent deductive skills.,1
TRISTIN,"But hey, I'm glad we did it.",1
PARIS,Oh sure.,1
TRISTIN,"When Rory first suggested us going out I thought the idea was crazy but she made some good points. We do have some history and well, you never know right?",1
PARIS,"Yes you never know. Ok, so we're done here right?",1
TRISTIN,Uh sure.,1
PARIS,Great. Excuse me.,1
RORY,What?,1
PARIS,It was your idea?,1
RORY,Paris.,1
PARIS,"So what, I get all your cast offs now?! I'm just that pathetic?!  Jee I don't want them so maybe I can con the suckers into taking out Paris the loser'! Throw the dog a bone!",1
RORY,Ok let me -,1
PARIS,I am not your charity case!,1
RORY,"No it's not like that, I swear. I just thought you guys would make a good couple that's all.",1
PARIS,We did make a good couple - for one night! But obviously we're more suited to just being friends or at least that was what was conveyed so humiliatingly to me just five seconds ago.,1
RORY,"Paris, I'm sorry -",1
PARIS,I hate you!,1
RORY,You told her?,1
TRISTIN,I didn't know it was a secret.,1
RORY,Why would you tell her? What is wrong with you?!,1
TRISTIN,"Rory relax, we tried ok, it didn't work out, it's not big deal.",1
RORY,It's a huge deal to Paris and you didn't try. One date isn't trying.,1
TRISTIN,Rory -,1
RORY,You said you'd try.,1
TRISTIN,"Hey, I'm sorry Paris is upset ok? But is it better that I keep dating her even thought I like somebody else?",1
RORY,Oh.,1
TRISTIN,Yeah.,1
RORY,I didn't realize. So...you're still not over Summer huh?,1
TRISTIN,,1
LORELAI,Hi.,1
GRANDMA,Hello.,1
LORELAI,Where's Gran?,1
GRANDMA,Torturing the bathroom attendant I suppose.,1
LORELAI,"Ah. So um, this place seems clean.",1
GRANDMA,"Yes, it's famous for it's cleanliness. So what did Rory say when you told her? About the money I mean. She must have been very excited.",1
LORELAI,Yes she was. Rose tea. That's funny. That's not really tea is it? It's like rose petals in hot water. More like a bad floral arrangement.,1
GRANDMA,"Well what did Rory say, fill me in?",1
LORELAI,She was happy.,1
GRANDMA,Happy?,1
LORELAI,Yeah - she screamed she did that air-lasso thing over her head.,1
GRANDMA,Lorelai be serious.,1
LORELAI,She was asleep when I got home Mom so I couldn't tell her.,1
GRANDMA,She doesn't know?,1
LORELAI,No.,1
GRANDMA,Well...something I said must've really struck a chord with you.,1
LORELAI,Excuse me?,1
GRANDMA,You didn't tell her so you must have had a reason.,1
LORELAI,"Ah she was asleep Mom, I just told you that.",1
GRANDMA,The only thing I can think of is that you must have reconsidered based on our conversation.,1
LORELAI,I didn't reconsider.,1
GRANDMA,I mean yesterday you could hardly wait to get home to announce your great fortune to her. Today all you can talk about is rose petal tea.,1
LORELAI,"Yes well, it's a little weird.",1
GRANDMA,"And you haven't told her that now she has her own money to put herself through school, to go to Europe -",1
LORELAI,Stop right now. This is just like you to take something that should be great and twist it into something ugly. Why do you do that? What is wrong with you?,1
GRANDMA,There's nothing wrong with me.,1
LORELAI,Yes there is. There's something seriously wrong with you. You should be studied.,1
GRANDMA,I don't understand why you're getting so upset. I respect the decision that you made.,1
LORELAI,I made no decision.,1
GRANDMA,Whatever you say.,1
LORELAI,"Ok, you know what? I'm going to call her and uh, tell her right now.",1
GRANDMA,No you're not.,1
LORELAI,Yes in fact I am.,1
GRANDMA,What are you doing?,1
LORELAI,The reception sucks in here.,1
GRANDMA,"Stop it, you look like you're having a fit.",1
LORELAI,"Ok, well I'm gonna go find a payphone.",1
GRANDMA,You're grandmother will be back any second. Just have a sandwich.,1
LORELAI,Have a sandwich? That's what you have to say to me? Have a sandwich.,1
GRANDMA,Well what do you want me to say?,1
LORELAI,I want you to say that you are sorry you tried to talk me out of taking this money. That you realize that you're just being petty and controlling and mean and that you know there's no amount of money that can change the relationship Rory and I have. That's what I want you to say - say that.,1
GRANDMA,I will not.,1
LORELAI,"Well say it Mom, or I'm finding a payphone.",1
TRIX,Lorelai - you're here.,1
LORELAI,Hi Gran.,1
TRIX,So have you ordered the tea yet?,1
GRANDMA,No not yet.,1
TRIX,Well good because I'm afraid I'm going to have to take my leave of you a little earlier than I had anticipated.,1
LORELAI,"What, why?",1
TRIX,My train leaves tonight and I have a little last minute packing to do.,1
GRANDMA,Well I can help you with the packing.,1
TRIX,"Plus I really don't wish to witness anymore of this ugly little fight you two seem to be having. Raising your voice during high tea, who ever heard of such a thing. It's like Fergi all over again.",1
LORELAI,"Oh Gran please, I'm so sorry. We're done. Please don't leave.",1
TRIX,"I can see now that offering that trust fund was a bad idea. After all, taking into account the maturity level of those involved, this large amount of money would probably not be safe.",1
LORELAI,"No Gran, that isn't true. Rory is an incredibly mature kid.",1
TRIX,Oh I'm sure she is. It's you I'm worried about.,1
LORELAI,But -,1
TRIX,. And I'm sure she gets it from you.,1
GRANDMA,But -,1
TRIX,"Tell Rory goodbye for me. You two are welcome to visit me in London anytime. Emily, please get my coat. I will meet you outside.",1
LORELAI,Well you won.,1
GRANDMA,I did not win.,1
LORELAI,You didn't want me to take the money and I'm not taking the money. That's called winning.,1
GRANDMA,I'm sorry.,1
LORELAI,No you're not.,1
GRANDMA,Well...yes I am.,1
LORELAI,"Forget it Mom, it's not big deal.",1
GRANDMA,No it is a big deal. Here Rory had this wonderful opportunity and we - and I...maybe I can talk to her.,1
LORELAI,Oh yes that'll work.,1
GRANDMA,Well I'll go to your father.,1
LORELAI,Mom...,1
GRANDMA,He can talk to her. He can fix it. I'll make him fix it. Ugh damn reception. Well I'll go to a payphone.,1
LORELAI,"Mom, Mom, stay here.",1
GRANDMA,Yes but Chilton.,1
LORELAI,Rory can still go to Chilton unless you're rethinking our agreement.,1
GRANDMA,"No, not at all. I'm not rethinking anything.",1
LORELAI,Ok then we're good.,1
GRANDMA,Are you sure?,1
LORELAI,We're good.,1
GRANDMA,Well I'd better get out there before she leaves me here.,1
LORELAI,I'm sure you'll be sorry to see her go.,1
GRANDMA,"Oh yes, I don't know what I'll do with my self. We'll see you Friday?",1
LORELAI,,1
GRANDMA,Yes?,1
LORELAI,Can I ask you a favor.,1
GRANDMA,"Anything, anything at all.",1
LORELAI,Don't make us take the coat rack back.,1
GRANDMA,,1
LORELAI,Hi.,1
RORY,Hey.,1
LORELAI,Here,1
RORY,Thanks. I thought you were gonna have tea today.,1
LORELAI,"Uh, we did, we finished.",1
RORY,Finished early.,1
LORELAI,"Yeah well once you're done with those little sandwiches, there's not reason to pretend you like tea anymore.",1
RORY,Oh I totally understand. Listen there's something I have to tell you.,1
LORELAI,What?,1
RORY,I loaned Paris your black mini and there's a good chance you may never see it again.,1
LORELAI,Oh well there's something I have to tell you.,1
RORY,What?,1
LORELAI,"You lost out on $250,000 dollars today.",1

RORY,"Grandma, can I have some baby pictures of you and Grandpa?",1
EMILY,Any particular reason?,1
RORY,"Yeah, we're doing this visual family history project for school.",1
EMILY,"Oh. Well, if it's for school I suppose I could dig something up.",1
RORY,And I need some of Mom too.,1
LORELAI,I thought we already had this conversation.,1
RORY,"Yeah, but I don't believe you.",1
LORELAI,Mother tell her.,1
EMILY,I don't have any baby pictures of your mother.,1
LORELAI,Thank you.,1
RORY,How could you not have any baby pictures of Mom?,1
EMILY,"Because when your mother was seven, I came downstairs and found her burning all of her baby pictures.",1
Rory,Why would you do that? I'm sure you were a cute baby.,1
EMILY,She was. She was very cute.,1
Lorelai,"Four, three, two, one.",1
EMILY,In most respects.,1
Lorelai,Then we have lift off.,1
Rory,What does that mean?,1
Posted,05/08/01 02:39,1
Lorelai,Nothing.,1
EMILY,I don't see what the problem is. You certainly grew into it.,1
Rory,Grown into what?,1
EMILY,"As a child, your mother had an unusually large head.",1
Lorelai,"The best thing about it was that she would tell me constantly. My first complete sentence was, ""Big head want dolly.""",1
Rory,I can't imagine it being that bad.,1
EMILY,It wasn't. It just affected her balance a little so. . .,1
Lorelai,"Okay, can we please talk about something besides my formerly huge head?",1
Rory,Are these new chairs Grandma?,1
EMILY,"Why, yes Rory, they are.",1
LORELAI,They are?,1
EMILY,I got them from a dealer up in Maine last summer. He just finished restoring them.,1
LORELAI,They look exactly like the old ones.,1
RORY,They're nice.,1
LORELAI,Are you sure they're new?,1
EMILY,Of course I'm sure. I bought them.,1
LORELAI,I don't see any difference at all.,1
EMILY,"Well, the arch in the back is higher and they have a completely different leg.",1
Lorelai,"Hmm, no difference.",1
EMILY,"Of course I could only get ten of these, so I'm two chairs short of a set.",1
Lorelai,You're telling me.,1
EMILY,"Lorelai, do you realize how rare these chairs are?",1
Lorelai,No.,1
EMILY,I've searched for three years or them. I've combed every fine antique store on the East Coast and this is all I could find. I blame Peg Mosley.,1
Lorelai,"Hm, Peg Mosley. Evil, evil woman.",1
Rory,What did Peg Mosley do?,1
Lorelai,She lured these two German children to her gingerbread house and then she tried to eat them.Pass the artichokes please.,1
EMILY,I made the mistake of telling Peg all my favorite special spots and that woman moved in and completely wiped them out. You can't find a decent Biedermayer hutch in all of Connecticut. I'm desperate for new sources.,1
Rory,What about Kim's Antiques?,1
EMILY,What's Kim's Antiques?,1
Lorelai,Didn't that burn down?,1
Rory,"My best friend Lane, her parents have this great antiques store in Stars Hollow.",1
EMILY,Is that so? Why haven't you ever told me about it?,1
Lorelai,"Oh, I don't know Mom. I guess it just got lost in my big head.",1
Rory,Maybe you should come to Stars Hollow and I'll take you there. Like Saturday. You can come see the town.,1
EMILY,"Well, won't you have to study?",1
Rory,I can put off studying for one day.,1
Lorelai,I'm working.,1
EMILY,No one is asking you to do anything Lorelai. This is between Rory and me. I accept your offer Rory. I would love to spend Saturday with you.,1
Rory,Great.,1
Lorelai,"Well, I'm just sorry that I'm gonna miss it.",1
EMILY,,1
LUKE,"Okay, French toast with bacon crispy. Pancakes, two eggs over easy.",1
Lorelai,Oh.,1
LUKE,What?,1
Lorelai,You put the eggs on top of the pancakes.,1
Rory,Oops.,1
LUKE,What?,1
Lorelai,"Yeah, well, it's like two eyes staring at me. See, I can't eat it like this.",1
Rory,Hence the oops.,1
LUKE,What are you talking about? You always order the same thing.,1
Lorelai,"Yeah, but you usually put the eggs on the side so that my breakfast is not ogling me.",1
LUKE,It's the same food.,1
Lorelai,"Hmm, yeah, I need the eggs put on the side.",1
LUKE,You want a brand new plate.,1
Lorelai,Yes.,1
LUKE,"How about if I take this plate in the back, I take the eggs off the pancakes, I put the same eggs on the side and bring the plate back out. What happens then?",1
Lorelai,Then I can eat my breakfast.,1
LUKE,It's the same food just a different configuration.,1
Lorelai,I won't know that.,1
LUKE,I'm gonna take the plate in the back.,1
Lorelai,So what time does the judgmental express arrive?,1
Rory,Grandma gets here at noon.,1
Lorelai,Hmm.,1
Rory,Are you sure you won't do lunch?,1
Lorelai,"Oh no, I can't, lunch is bad.",1
RACHELorelai,"Lorelai, you're here. Good. Don't move.",1
Lorelai,I won't.,1
Rory,What are you doing at lunch?,1
Lorelai,"Oh, I have very important things to do.",1
Rory,Like what?,1
Lorelai,"Well, at noon I have to not have lunch with my mother.",1
Rory,Very nice.,1
RACHELorelai,"So I'm developing my pictures from the Firelight Festival. Some amazing stuff. And I'm thinking maybe there's a book here, faces of small town America. . .",1
Lorelai,"Ah, you should feel safe, you don't live near these people.",1
RACHELorelai,Exactly. And the very last shot on my roll was this.,1
Lorelai,Wow. When did you take this?,1
RACHELorelai,When you weren't looking.,1
LUKE,What's that?,1
Lorelai,"Oh, it's a picture of us.",1
LUKE,Us?,1
RORY,Rachel took it.,1
RACHELorelai,At the Firelight Festival.,1
LUKE,"Oh, sure, yeah. So, uh, here's your plate, no eyes.",1
Lorelai,Thank you.,1
RACHELorelai,Do you wear contacts?,1
Lorelai,Me? No.,1
RACHELorelai,"God, you've got amazing eyes. Doesn't she?",1
LUKE,"Oh, yeah. Sure, I guess. . . I mean, they're, you know, placed good. . . . symmetrical. I'm gonna get some mo re coffee.",1
RACHELorelai,Yeah.,1
Rory,"Oh wow. Mom, look at this.",1
Lorelai,What is that?,1
RACHELorelai,It's an old abandoned inn I ran across when I was exploring the other day.,1
Lorelai,This is Dragonfly. I totally forgot about this place.,1
RACHELorelai,"Well, it doesn't look like it's been operational in years.",1
Rory,"Look at all the trees. It's pretty. Oh, I'm buzzing.",1
Lorelai,What have I said about buzzing in public?,1
Rory,It's Lane. 911. That's trig. Gotta go.,1
Lorelai,Bye. Take a . . . yeah.,1
Rory,Bye Rachel.,1
RACHELorelai,"Bye. See, that is one really not annoying kid.",1
Lorelai,"Yes, she really is not.",1
RACHELorelai,"See, I might consider doing the whole mom thing if I could be guaranteed that I could get one just like her.",1
Lorelai,"Oh you can, you just have to go to Sears. God, where is this again?",1
RACHELorelai,"Uh, it's kind of behind the mill. You go over the little footbridge with the mean duck family living under it.",1
Lorelai,"Yes, the Armbrusters. Wow, it's really amazing.",1
RACHELorelai,Do you want to see it?,1
Lorelai,What?,1
RACHELorelai,The inn. I'm gonna head out that way in a little while.,1
Lorelai,"Oh, well. . .",1
RACHELorelai,"Come on, finish your breakfast. I'll drive us out there.",1
LUKE,Drive her out where?,1
RACHELorelai,"Oh, Lorelai and I are going to cruise the docks.",1
Lorelai,"Yeah, we're gonna see how many sailors we can get to tattoo our names on their butts.",1
RACHELorelai,So what do you think?,1
Lorelai,"Well, I have to check in at the inn first.",1
RACHELorelai,Well that's okay. Good. I'll pick you up there.,1
Lorelai,Okay. Good.,1
LUKE,So what was all about?,1
Lorelai,Oh nothing. We're just gonna go check out this old inn Rachel found.,1
LUKE,Hmm.,1
Lorelai,What?,1
LUKE,Nothing. I didn't know you guys were friends.,1
Lorelai,"Hm, well we're not really friends. I mean, I don't know her that well. But we're just hanging out. She seems really great.",1
LUKE,"Oh yeah, she is. She's great. She's just, you know, a lot different from you.",1
Lorelai,'Cause I'm not really great?,1
LUKE,"No, you're great. Just in a different way.",1
Lorelai,In a not really great way?,1
LUKE,"That's not what I meant. The two of you are just completely different people. Both great, but I'm just a little surprised that, you know, you're different types of greatness are, you know, melding and you're comfortably great together.",1
Lorelai,Is this bothering you?,1
LUKE,"This conversation, yes.",1
Lorelai,"No. Um, the idea of Rachel and I hanging out together. Is there some reason that's weird for you or something?",1
LUKE,Why would it be?,1
Lorelai,No reason I can think of.,1
LUKE,"Okay, well then it's not weird.",1
Lorelai,"Good, well I was just checking.",1
LUKE,"Okay, well then, you checked.",1
Lorelai,Okay. So are you gonna be pouring that coffee anytime or. . .,1
LUKE,Oh.,1
Lorelai,I'm glad it's not weird though because . . . . . that would be bad.,1
LUKE,,1
LORELAI,"Welcome Ichiro Motors to the Independence Inn. So the dining room is right through there. And breakfast is served 6 to 11:30, although our chef is an amazing overachiever and she'll be happy to prepare you anything you want any time of day. Now your itinerary for the conference will be in each of your rooms. And if you have any questions at all, just please feel free to ask, uh . . .",1
MICHELorelai,No.,1
LORELAI,,1
Lorelai,Rune is in the lobby.,1
SOOKIE,"Lorelai, hello. I made some coffee.",1
Lorelai,Rune is in the lobby.,1
SOOKIE,"Oh, I also made those little orange glazed muffins you like with warm cinnamon butter.",1
Lorelai,"Sookie, Rune is in the lobby.",1
SOOKIE,Uh huh.,1
Lorelai,Why?,1
SOOKIE,Your muffin's getting cold.,1
Lorelai,My muffin's fine. My muffin wants to know what the fruitcake is doing in the lobby.,1
SOOKIE,"Well, he's staying with Jackson.",1
Lorelai,Again?,1
SOOKIE,Still.,1
Lorelai,I thought he was only here for a weekend.,1
SOOKIE,"Yes, the lost weekend.",1
Lorelai,"Okay. Explain Yoko, because he's out there with the normal people and he's going to scare them",1
SOOKIE,He won't leave.,1
Lorelai,Jackson's house?,1
SOOKIE,Yes. Jackson's house. He won't leave and it's driving me crazy.,1
Lorelai,Well tell Jackson to kick him out.,1
SOOKIE,Jackson won't do it.,1
Lorelai,Why not?,1
SOOKIE,Because he says it's family and somehow he feels responsible for him.,1
Lorelai,"Well, okay yes, but has Jackson met him? I think that would change his mind.",1
SOOKIE,"Apparently, Rune had a rough childhood. His parents don't talk to him, his brothers and sisters don't talk to him, no one talks to him.",1
Lorelai,"So, then what's wrong with Jackson?",1
SOOKIE,I don't know. But he's determined to stand by him and I have to respect his decision.,1
Lorelai,"Well, that part I can understand.",1
SOOKIE,Good.,1
Lorelai,But the part I can't understand is what is Rune doing in the lobby?,1
SOOKIE,"Yeah, well, I don't . . .",1
JACKSON,Lorelai.,1
Lorelai,Jackson.,1
JACKSON,These are for you.,1
Lorelai,For me?,1
JACKSON,Yeah and I also brought some of my raspberry peach jam. I think you're gonna like it. Put it on ice cream.,1
Lorelai,Okay.,1
JACKSON,"Or take a graham cr*cker, spread a little on it, break up a chocolate bar, throw it in the broiler for a couple of minutes, and you're gonna be singing show tunes all evening.",1
Lorelai,Must be some good jam.,1
JACKSON,"Yeah, well, it's just my way of saying thanks for helping out Rune.",1
Lorelai,Thanks for helping out Rune.,1
SOOKIE,"Okay, I'm doing the spoon signal.",1
JACKSON,"Oh, I didn't notice.",1
SOOKIE,"Okay, I'm waving around like an idiot here.",1
JACKSON,So you haven't. . .,1
SOOKIE,No.,1
JACKSON,Ah.,1
SOOKIE,Yeah.,1
JACKSON,So I should . . .,1
SOOKIE,Good idea.,1
JACKSON,"Right. Um, enjoy the jam.",1
Lorelai,"Well, uh, would you mind explaining the thank you jam.",1
SOOKIE,"Well, I was supposed to ask you something about Rune.",1
Lorelai,Like what?,1
SOOKIE,"Well, he just not too long ago lost his job.",1
Lorelai,"Oh, attitude problem?",1
SOOKIE,Something like that.,1
Lorelai,Uh huh.,1
SOOKIE,"Anyway, when he lost his job, he couldn't pay his rent so then he got evicted. None of this was known to us when he came to stay with Jackson. I mean, but this is the situation. So I was thinking that if he could get another job and then he could save up some money and afford his own place and move out, and then I wouldn't end up stabbing him in the neck with a grapefruit spoon.",1
Lorelai,Ouch.,1
SOOKIE,Its gonna happen.,1
Lorelai,You want me to give him a job?,1
SOOKIE,Nothing important.,1
Lorelai,"Oh good, 'cause I was gonna put him in charge of legal.",1
SOOKIE,"I know it's a lot to ask, but I can't think of anything else.",1
Lorelai,What can he do?,1
SOOKIE,"Lots of things! He's always fiddling around, using screws. Once I saw him use a hammer.",1
Lorelai,A hammer ?,1
SOOKIE,I bet he could be a handyman. You are always looking for a good handyman.,1
Lorelai,Well I couldn't pay him very much.,1
SOOKIE,"Well, that's okay. Maybe he could just work for, uh, room and board.",1
Lorelai,You want him to live here?,1
SOOKIE,"No! Well, what about the old potting shed?",1
Lorelai,The old potting shed? That's where Rory and I lived when she was a baby. It has memories and little rosebud wallpaper. I don't want Boo Radley touching my rosebud wallpaper.,1
SOOKIE,The job is enough. You're right. He can save up money and eventually move out. I'll just have to deal with it.,1
Lorelai,The potting shed's fine.,1
SOOKIE,Really?,1
Lorelai,Yes.,1
SOOKIE,I love you!,1
Lorelai,"But I swear to God Sookie, the minute the guests start complaining or disappearing, he's out of there.",1
SOOKIE,More than fair.,1
Lorelai,"Mm, it's really good jam.",1
SOOKIE,,1
Rory,Grandma.,1
EMILY,"Rory, hello. What a lovely day to. . . ugh. I guess putting in a walkway never occurred to your mother.",1
Rory,Oh actually it occurs to her every day on the way to work. Here.,1
EMILY,,1
Rory,Are your shoes okay?,1
EMILY,They're fine. Just a little muddy that's all.,1
Rory,Here give 'em. I'll clean them for you.,1
EMILY,Oh you don't have to do that.,1
Rory,"My mom found this great shoe cleaner. It's gets out pretty much anything. Do you want something to drink, there should be some iced tea in the fridge.",1
EMILY,Iced tea would be nice. Oh my god. There's nothing in here.,1
Rory,"I know, it's a little sparse.",1
EMILY,It's the Grapes of Wrath.,1
Rory,Don't worry. We eat fine.,1
EMILY,"No food, no drink. Do you at least have plates?",1
Rory,"Yes, we have plates.",1
EMILY,There are women in bikinis on them.,1
Rory,"The original Charlie's Angels. It took us years to get a complete set. You can find the Kate Jackson's and the Shelly Hack's pretty easily. Even the Cheryl Ladd's. But the Farrah Fawcett's and the Jacklyn Smith's are a little harder to come by, but still accessible. The real trick however is to find the Tanya Roberts. We have three.",1
EMILY,You have three Tanya Roberts?,1
Rory,Yup.,1
EMILY,"And I was worried, silly me. How are you doing with those shoes?",1
Rory,All done.,1
EMILY,That's amazing. What is that you used?,1
Rory,"I don't know. We got if off one of those late night TV ads. Apparently it also gets rust off nails and hinges, waxes your car perfectly, and weatherproofs windows and doors.",1
EMILY,"Well, isn't that nice?",1
Rory,"Okay, about today. I think I should just give you the grand tour of the town. So we can start by walking to Kim's Antiques, which takes us by all the good sites.",1
EMILY,"Well, uh, Rory, I don't think I wore the right shoes for the grand tour. Why don't we just drive?",1
Rory,You can borrow some of my mom's shoes.,1
EMILY,"Uh, no, I don't think so. Rory hold on a minute.",1
Rory,"Grandma, you will be missing the true Stars Hollow experience if you don't walk. Trust me.",1
EMILY,"All right, but I won't wear anything with rhinestones or zebra stripes or anything that has batteries or that sings or make animal noises or moves on its own.",1
Rory,,1
LORELAI,Must have been something when it was all fixed up and nice.,1
RACHELorelai,Can I ask what the fascination with this place is?,1
Lorelai,"Oh, well, me an d my friend Sookie, we've been kind of toying with the idea of opening our own place together.",1
RACHELorelai,Really?,1
Lorelai,"Yeah. I mean someday, obviously not now. We're still saving up.",1
RACHELorelai,Are you close?,1
Lorelai,"No, not at all.",1
RACHELorelai,"Well, this looks like this could be a great place.",1
Lorelai,"Yeah it really does. God. A little paint, some pretty curtains, 150 thousand dollars of construction. We're open for business.",1
RACHELorelai,Did you always want to own an inn?,1
Lorelai,"Uh no, I was still dreaming of owning a red Camaro when Rory appeared on the scene.",1
RACHELorelai,Ah. Right,1
Lorelai,It's a new idea in the last couple years actually. How about you? Did you always want to be a photographer?,1
RACHELorelai,Not specifically. I just rememb er growing up thinking I want to be anywhere but here.,1
Lorelai,"Ah, that was you in the other room.",1
RACHELorelai,"I made sure to pick something that would keep me moving, constantly.",1
Lorelai,Sounds exciting.,1
RACHELorelai,"It is. Tiring too. And now that I'm here, back with Luke, I don't know.",1
Lorelai,Things seem to be going pretty well for you guys.,1
RACHELorelai,"I guess. But I tell you, these last couple weeks, it's become increasingly apparent to me that things just can't continue the way they've been.",1
Lorelai,What do you mean?,1
RACHELorelai,"I mean, I think it's time w e get serious. I'm ready to settle down, I guess, is the creepy oldfashion term for it. Pretty damn scary, huh?",1
Lorelai,,1
EMILY,I feel ridiculous.,1
Rory,You look great.,1
EMILY,I feel like a Clydesdale.,1
Rory,You look like you're comfortable.,1
EMILY,People are staring.,1
Rory,Because you look great.,1
EMILY,,1
EMILY,I think we came in through the storeroom.,1
Rory,"Nope, this is it.",1
EMILY,This is the antique store?,1
Rory,You have to dig but you can find some great stuff here.,1
EMILY,This is ridiculous. No one can run a quality business like this. This place is dusty and disorganized and you can't possibly. . . . Oh now that is gorgeous. Look at the woodwork. It's exquisite. I wonder if it has mate.,1
Rory,"Grandma, look at this. It's got like little flowers all over it.",1
EMILY,It's very pretty.,1
Rory,Is it something special?,1
EMILY,Do you like it?,1
Rory,Yeah.,1
EMILY,Then it's something special.,1
LANE,Hi.,1
Rory,"Lane, this is my grandma. Grandma, this is my friend Lane.",1
EMILY,"Well, I've heard a lot about you.",1
LANE,"It's nice to meet you. Uh, Rory can I talk to you for a sec?",1
EMILY,"Go, talk. I have a lot of looking to do here.",1
LANE,Problem.,1
Rory,Hit me.,1
LANE,"It's been a week since that party, and still he has not called.",1
Rory,Henry.,1
LANE,He said he'd call.,1
Rory,Maybe he's been busy.,1
LANE,Maybe he has a girlfriend.,1
Rory,Lane.,1
LANE,A tiny perfect Korean girl that his parents would love and approve of.,1
Rory,"Lane, you are a tiny perfect Korean girl that his parents would love and approve of.",1
LANE,"No, they'd know.",1
Rory,Know what?,1
LANE,Know that I listen to the wrong music and wish I could go blond without looking like an idiot. Or that I'd take a whopper over kimchi in a heartbeat.,1
Rory,Now you're just going crazy.,1
LANE,"So he doesn't like me, he's not gonna call. It's not the end of the world. I'll live. I'll go one. There's always college. Unless my parents get their way, and then it's 'I take thee Jesus to be my lawful wedded husband.'",1
Rory,"Lane, with all due respect to your fiancé, Henry will call.",1
LANE,No he's not.,1
Rory,Well then why did he talk to you all night. .,1
LANE,Well. .,1
Rory,. . and follow you around everywhere you went. .,1
LANE,'cause . . .,1
Rory,. .and ask you to dance six times?,1
LANE,Was it six times?,1
Rory,"It was six times. And he did not ask you to dance six times because you're a good dancer, because to tell you the truth and as much as I love you, you're not.",1
LANE,Really?,1
Rory,You are an embarrassment to the art of dancing.,1
LANE,,1
EMILY,,1
KIM,No.,1
EMILY,,1
KIM,Perfect condition!,1
EMILY,,1
KIM,Thirty-five hundred for the pair.,1
EMILY,,1
KIM,No. No joke.,1
EMILY,,1
KIM,Not a better pair on the East Coast.,1
EMILY,,1
KIM,You're from Hartford.,1
EMILY,,1
KIM,Ah.,1
EMILY,,1
KIM,Look on the bottom.,1
EMILY,,1
KIM,Look on the bottom.,1
EMILY,,1
KIM,,1
KIM,They're signed.,1
EMILY,,1
KIM,You have my word.,1
EMILY,,1
KIM,That too. LANE : It's like watching the Williams' sisters.,1
Rory,,1
KIM,. . .Insulting!,1
EMILY,,1
KIM,Then someone else will!,1
EMILY,,1
KIM,I can wait.,1
EMILY,,1
KIM,That's my last offer.,1
EMILY,,1
KIM,I'll waive the tax.,1
EMILY,,1
KIM,,1
EMILY,I like that woman. And you know what? I like these shoes.,1
Rory,You're becoming one of us Grandma.,1
EMILY,This way?,1
Rory,Yeah.,1
EMILY,,1
RUNE,Hey.,1
MICHELorelai,May I help you?,1
RUNE,"Yeah, I need to know where my room is.",1
MICHELorelai,"Uh, are you sure you are in the right place? Perhaps you want the YMCA or the local bus station.",1
RUNE,You speak English?,1
MICHELorelai,Do you have a reservation?,1
RUNE,I work here.,1
MICHELorelai,"Hm, I do not think so. You see, we have standards, and even if they were much much lower, you would still be poor boy out of luck.",1
RUNE,I'm the new handyman. Lorelai hired me,1
MICHELorelai,"Oh, you know Lorelai?",1
RUNE,I dated her.,1
MICHELorelai,Oh you did?,1
RUNE,"Yeah, but hey, don't spread it around, it's not one of my shining moments.",1
MICHELorelai,"Yeah, and you probably have so many to pick from.",1
RUNE,You're rude.,1
MICHELorelai,"You've caught me to the quick, out of here teeny tiny man.",1
RUNE,Look I will only be pushed so far.,1
MICHELorelai,And obviously it's down.,1
LORELAI,"Rune, you made it, great.",1
RUNE,Finally. Will you tell this guy who I am?,1
Lorelai,This is Rune.,1
MICHELorelai,You know him?,1
Lorelai,He's gonna be our new handyman.,1
RUNE,See! Handyman.,1
MICHELorelai,Be quiet.,1
RUNE,Go build us another statue.,1
MICHELorelai,You hired this man?,1
Lorelai,Yes.,1
MICHELorelai,Did you date him also?,1
Lorelai,"What! No, I didn't date him. Rune, I didn't date you. It was one night. .",1
MICHELorelai,"One night, you and him together?",1
Lorelai,I'll explain later.,1
MICHELorelai,"Oh, I cannot wait.",1
Lorelai,"Yeah. Listen, Rune, here, come w ith me, I'll show you where you're gonna stay.",1
RUNE,Can you ask your bellboy here to grab my stuff? I think I might've sprained my shoulder on the way over here.,1
Lorelai,Relax. I got it. Uh. Geez. Move it Rune.,1
RORY,"So, what do you think?",1
EMILY,"Well, I think it's very nice.",1
RORY,Mom's office is right back there. Oh and you have to see the dining room. They got the chandeliers from one of Martha Washington's houses.,1
EMILY,Do you spend a lot of time here?,1
RORY,"Yeah. I work here a couple afternoons a week, and I help out with special occasions. They have a lot of weddings here. I wonder where mom is.",1
EMILY,"Oh, don't bother your mother. I'm sure she's busy.",1
Rory,"Oh no, she'd want to say hi.",1
Rory,"Michel, where's Mom?",1
MICHELorelai,Off with her boyfriend.,1
Rory,What boyfriend?,1
MICHELorelai,"Small, dark, wanted in four states.",1
Rory,"Okay, well, do you know when she's coming back because my grandmother's here and we want to say hi.",1
MICHELorelai,Your grandmother?,1
EMILY,Emily Gilmore.,1
MICHELorelai,Michel Gerard.,1
EMILY,Enchantée. D'où venez vous?,1
MICHELorelai,Paris.,1
EMILY,J'adore Paris. Nous y allons chaque printemps.,1
MICHELorelai,"Oh, oui, le printemps à Paris...",1
EMILY,"Un cliché, mais pourtant...",1
MICHELorelai,"C'est si vrai, c'est si vrai...",1
RORY,"Okay, well, we better go find mom.",1
EMILY,It's been a pleasure meet ing you.,1
MICHELorelai,The pleasure is all mine.,1
EMILY,What a charming man.,1
Rory,"Uh okay. Mom, hi.",1
Lorelai,"Mom, hi.",1
EMILY,"Lorelai, it's quite a place you've got here.",1
Lorelai,"Oh, well it's not really my place, I just work here, so. . I thought you were gonna go antiquing.",1
Rory,Yeah we did. And then we had lunch.,1
Lorelai,"Oh, really? Where?",1
EMILY,Teriyaki Joe's.,1
Lorelai,You're kidding.,1
Rory,She picked.,1
Lorelai,You did?,1
EMILY,It looked festive.,1
Lorelai,I can't picture you at Teriyaki Joe's . . .or in jogging shoes. What's up working girl?,1
EMILY,"Well, Rory decided that we should take the grand tour of the town; that meant walking. I hope you don't mind, I borrowed your socks also.",1
Lorelai,"Oh, I don't mind. I wish I had a camera, but I don't mind.",1
Rory,I'm gonna go show her the grounds.,1
Lorelai,"Oh yeah, good. On the way back, show her the gym. Jump on the treadmill.",1
Rory,See you later.,1
Lorelai,Make sure you stretch first.,1
MICHELorelai,,1
RORY,"So the horses are up on that hill, and the tennis courts are over there.",1
EMILY,It's certainly impressive.,1
RORY,And this is my favorite place.,1
EMILY,The tool shed?,1
RORY,"No, this is where we used to live.",1
EMILY,What?,1
Rory,"Right when mom and I moved here, this was our apartment.",1
EMILY,But. .,1
Rory,"I know it's looks small, but it's really pretty. Come on. See we had our bed right over there, and mom put up this really pretty curtain around the tub so that it looked like a real bathroom. And we would just sit outside at night when the Inn would have parties and we'd just listen to music and feed the ducks and. . . Grandma? Grandma wait, what's the matter?",1
EMILY,Nothing.,1
Rory,Did something happen? Are you sick? Is it the teriyaki?,1
EMILY,"I'm fine. Its just getting late, I have to go.",1
Rory,But. . .,1
RUNE,Hey. Do you mind?,1
Rory,,1
RACHELorelai,"Hey! Good, you got my message.",1
LORELAI,Hail the glory of the answering machine.,1
RACHELorelai,Come on in. I just developed some sh*ts of the Dragonfly I think you're gonna love. Maybe they can help inspire you a little more.,1
Lorelai,"Oh, great! Hm, I've never been in Luke's apartment before.",1
RACHELorelai,Really? How long have you two known each other?,1
Lorelai,"Oh god, years. But our relationship is strictly ""Please can I have coffee?"", 'No,', 'Come on!, 'No, it makes you short.' Blah blah blah.",1
RACHELorelai,"Well, then let me give you the grand tour. This, is it.",1
Lorelai,"It's, uh, not how I pictured it. I mean, not that I've been picturing Luke's apartment. I haven't been picturing it at all.",1
RACHELorelai,I know what you meant.,1
Lorelai,Hmm. Nice touch.,1
RACHELorelai,"Oh, those aren't mine.",1
Lorelai,You're kidding.,1
RACHELorelai,"Nope. Frankly, a little too frilly for my taste.",1
Lorelai,I'm gonna give him so much crap about that.,1
RACHELorelai,Have a seat.,1
Lorelai,"Thanks. Man, you guys are living in pretty tight quarters here.",1
RACHELorelai,"Well this was originally his dad's office, so it was never really meant for anyone to actually live in.",1
Lorelai,But tell that to Luke.,1
RACHELorelai,Exactly.,1
Lorelai,Do you think about moving to a bigger place?,1
RACHELorelai,I don't think so.,1
Lorelai,"No? Oh right. Because tight quarters, romantic. Hello Lorelai.",1
RACHELorelai,"Yeah, well I don't think romance has a lot to do with it.",1
Lorelai,No?,1
RACHELorelai,I'm not sure I'm gonna be in Stars Hollow much longer.,1
Lorelai,Oh. But I thought. . .,1
RACHELorelai,"I know, I just, I can't seem to make Luke believe that I really want to stay this time.",1
Lorelai,Did you tell him all that stuff you told me?,1
RACHELorelai,Till I was blue in the face.,1
Lorelai,Well you just have to keep trying until he hears you.,1
RACHELorelai,"Hey, I don't blame him. I've given him no reason to believe me. I just hope that magically somehow he'd, I don't know, forget that I'd skipped out on him a million times before.",1
Lorelai,Have you told him that you're thinking of leaving?,1
RACHELorelai,Nope.,1
Lorelai,Are you going to?,1
RACHELorelai,"I don't know. I mean, I feel like I've been trying so hard to make everything good. But this town, you know, it's like living under a microscope. Everyone here is just waiting for you to screw up.",1
Lorelai,No that's not true.,1
RACHELorelai,Miss Patty?,1
Lorelai,"Oh, well yeah.",1
RACHELorelai,I don't know how long I can stick around here waiting for Luke when I feel like I don't have a friend in the world.,1
Lorelai,"Hey, if you can French braid hair, I'll be your friend.",1
RACHELorelai,Sorry.,1
Lorelai,"Oh, well, see ya.",1
RACHELorelai,I cannot find your pictures here. They must be in the bathroom.,1
Lorelai,So do not wanna know why.,1
RACHELorelai,"Hey, I know this is not so not cool to ask. But if the situation comes up and it's not too weird, a little word of encouragement from you might help a lot.",1
Lorelai,"Oh, yeah, sure. If it comes up.",1
RACHELorelai,Thanks,1
Lorelai,"What, you don't knock?",1
LUKE,What are you doing here?,1
Lorelai,Rachel invited me.,1
LUKE,Oh.,1
Lorelai,To look at some pictures.,1
LUKE,Good.,1
Lorelai,Yeah. And go through your underwear drawer.,1
LUKE,Where is she?,1
Lorelai,Freezing your bra.,1
LUKE,Where?,1
Lorelai,In the bathroom.,1
LUKE,Right.,1
Lorelai,It's a nice place you have here.,1
LUKE,Thank you.,1
Lorelai,I like the curtains.,1
LUKE,"Yeah, yeah, Rachel picked them out.",1
Lorelai,"Oh, she's got good taste.",1
RACHELorelai,Oh. Hey.,1
LUKE,Hi. I just had to put something in the safe.,1
RACHELorelai,We were just. . .,1
Lorelai,I told him about the underwear drawer.,1
RACHELorelai,And the baseball cap fashion show?,1
LUKE,Okay. I'm gonna go now.,1
Lorelai,,1
RORY,I like this song. It makes me gloomy.,1
LANE,Gloom is good.,1
Rory,Really gloomy.,1
LANE,Like Joy Division Gloomy? Nick Cave gloomy? Robert Smith gloomy?,1
Rory,Johnny Cash gloomy.,1
LANE,"So kind of like a San Quentin-y, it's a long road home and my horse just got shot but I've still got my girl by my side gloomy?",1
Rory,You read my mind.,1
LANE,I'm deep in a Charlie Parker gloomy.,1
Rory,Henry still hasn't called?,1
LANE,"Oh no, he called.",1
Rory,He did? Why didn't you tell me?,1
LANE,"Well I didn't talk to him. He left a message. I listened to it eight-and-a-half times, but then my mom came home an d I had to erase it. But I was so panicked that I broke it, which is better because now all evidence that a boy called me is in the trash.",1
Rory,Eight and a half times.,1
LANE,Well it was a good message the first couple times. Then I started parsing it for subtext.,1
Rory,What did he say?,1
LANE,"He said, and I quote, ""Hey Lane, it's Henry."" Not a good start.",1
Rory,How do you figure?,1
LANE,It's so gender neutral. It's how you start a conversation with a bowling pal.,1
Rory,He asked you bowling?,1
LANE,"Then he said ""It was fun meet ing you the other night.""",1
Rory,What?,1
LANE,"He didn't say which night. Like he didn't remember which night. Like he's mixing me up with another girl from another night. For all I know, he thought he was calling the hot blonde he met at a hopped up night at Balthazar's.",1
Rory,He's a 16 year old Korean boy.,1
LANE,Or so he led me to believe.,1
Rory,What's the bottom line here?,1
LANE,"Okay, the bottom line is that he wants me to call him back. But if I do that then he's probably gonna ask me out on a date. And if we go out on a date then it could lead to anotherdate, and then I'll have to introduce him to my parents. And once I do that, they're gonna like him. Because he's Korean and he's gonna be a doctor. And then once that happens, that's it. It'll be over. He'll be hideous to me. Now I'm a Lou Reed gloomy.",1
Rory,Hello?,1
EMILY,"Rory, hello. Do you have a minute?",1
Rory,"Uh, sure.",1
EMILY,Now I know this will probably seem silly but I was wondering what your favorite color is.,1
Rory,"Oh, I don't really have one. Blue I guess.",1
EMILY,Okay. What about flowers? Do you like flowers?,1
Rory,Sure.,1
EMILY,"Which would you say you like better, roses or lilies?",1
Rory,"Hmm, sunflowers.",1
EMILY,"Sunflowers it is. Now, what about music? N'sync or 98 degrees? R : Uh, N'sync or 98 degrees?",1
LANE,What kind of sick joke is this?,1
Rory,I don't think I could choose.,1
EMILY,What about that other group? The Backside Boys?,1
Rory,You mean the Backstreet Boys?,1
EMILY,Yes that's it.,1
Rory,"Um, I guess if I really had to choose, I'd say N'sync.",1
EMILY,Wonderful.,1
Rory,Are you writing this down?,1
EMILY,Maybe.,1
Rory,What for?,1
EMILY,You'll see. I'm looking forward to dinner on Friday.,1
Rory,"Okay, yeah, me too.",1
Rory,What was that?,1
LANE,Sounded like some sick take on the Gallup survey. I gotta go,1
Rory,Call him.,1
LANE,"I already left him a message, he's probably parsing it right now.",1
Rory,,1
LUKE,Hey.,1
Lorelai,Hey.,1
LUKE,Want some coffee?,1
Lorelai,"Oh, yeah coffee would be great.",1
Lorelai,Thanks.,1
LUKE,Watch the lid there.,1
Lorelai,"Yeah. Wow, it really looks, um, different from back here, ya know? All this is yours, as far as the eye can see.",1
LUKE,"Yes, it's quite an empire I've built for myself. I'm thinking of conquering the flower shop next door and expanding the freezer.",1
Lorelai,"Hey, I didn't mean to kick you out of your own apartment.",1
LUKE,"Oh, you didn't.",1
Lorelai,Well you left pretty fast.,1
LUKE,"Yeah, you guys looks like you were talking girl talk.",1
Lorelai,Girl talk.,1
LUKE,Yeah.,1
Lorelai,What's girl talk?,1
LUKE,"You know, pantyhose, nail polish.",1
Lorelai,Curtains.,1
LUKE,Yes. That stuff.,1
Lorelai,You didn't like me being up there?,1
LUKE,,1
Lorelai,"So, this is the fascinating storage area where fascinating acts of storage take place.",1
LUKE,"Yup, this is it.",1
Lorelai,Some good looking pickles.,1
LUKE,What are you doing?,1
Lorelai,I'm admiring your pickles.,1
LUKE,You shouldn't be in here.,1
Lorelai,Why not?,1
LUKE,'Cause my insurance covers only me.,1
Lorelai,That's not true. You're kidding right?,1
LUKE,"Its not safe, something might fall.",1
Lorelai,You don't like me hanging out with Rachel do you?,1
LUKE,"Oh, come on.",1
Lorelai,Am I right?,1
LUKE,You can hang out with anybody you want.,1
Lorelai,Not my question.,1
LUKE,Well that's my answer.,1
Lorelai,"Well, we're eight.",1
LUKE,Just a friendly piece of advice. Don't get too attached to her.,1
Lorelai,Rachel?,1
LUKE,"Yeah. She's got an interesting habit of getting bored and then leaving, usually without saying goodbye.",1
Lorelai,People break habits.,1
LUKE,Not often.,1
Lorelai,So you're just convinced that that's what she's gonna do?,1
LUKE,I'll bet you that's exactly what she does.,1
Lorelai,"Well, let's say that is what she does. Don't you think there's the teensiest possibility that ifRachel leaves Stars Hollow this time it s because she thinks you don't want her to stay?",1
LUKE,Are you guys talking about me?,1
Lorelai,No . . . Yes.,1
LUKE,"Okay, I don't mind if you hang out with her, but you will not talk about me.",1
Lorelai,"Why? It's fun. We wear plaid, take turns not shaving.",1
LUKE,There will be no Luke talk period.,1
Lorelai,Do you wanna know what I think about this situation?,1
LUKE,No.,1
Lorelai,Are you sure?,1
LUKE,"Look, if you're gonna tell me at least help me unload.",1
Lorelai,Can I use the fun cutter thingy?,1
LUKE,Not if you call it the fun cutter thingy.,1
Lorelai,Please.,1
LUKE,"Cut the box, not your hand.",1
Lorelai,"Good tip, you should teach. Ha! Fun!",1
LUKE,Talk.,1
Lorelai,"Well, I don't know exactly what's going on in Rachel's head because I'm not a Vulcan, but from the way she talks about you and the way she smiles when your name comes up, I'm pretty sure that she's serious about staying in Stars Hollow this time.",1
LUKE,"Yeah, let me guess. Rachel told you she wanted to put down roots, that she's serious this time, that she's tired of the road, and realizes what's lacking in her nomadic existence.",1
Lorelai,"She didn't use the phrase nomadic existence, but basically yes, that's what she said.",1
LUKE,I've heard the speech. I know the speech by heart.,1
Lorelai,"Well, I think she means it this time.",1
LUKE,You don't know her like I do.,1
Lorelai,I don't. But she seems sincere.,1
LUKE,How do you know?,1
Lorelai,Her nose didn't grow.,1
LUKE,Why are you taking her side?,1
Lorelai,I'm not taking her side.,1
LUKE,Well it sounds like you're taking her side.,1
Lorelai,"Well, wash out your ears, I'm not taking her side.",1
LUKE,I mean you're practically pushing her on me.,1
Lorelai,I just want you to be happy.,1
LUKE,And you know what makes me happy?,1
Lorelai,"No, I just know that you've been carrying a torch for her for a really long time.",1
LUKE,I have not been carrying a torch for her.,1
Lorelai,"Well, you wanted this to happen.",1
LUKE,How do you know what I wanted to happen?,1
Lorelai,Didn't you?,1
LUKE,"Yeah, I guess.",1
Lorelai,"Okay. So here it is, right in front of you. Just take it. Take the plunge. She could be ready. Just jump in and believe her. Unless, you know, there's some other reason you don't want to.",1
LUKE,Like what?,1
Lorelai,Like I. . . .I don't know.,1
LUKE,There's no other reason.,1
Lorelai,"Okay, well, fine. Then there's no other reason.",1
LUKE,I'll think about it.,1
Lorelai,"Okay. Well, thanks for letting me borrow your thingy.",1
LUKE,You're welcome.,1
Lorelai,,1
Lorelai,She actually asked if you like the Backstreet Boys?,1
Rory,Except she called them Bac kside Boys.,1
Lorelai,Ha! That is high comedy. What inspired that woman?,1
Rory,I don't know. It was weird.,1
Lorelai,"Sudden interest in pop music I sat her down to listen to a Prince song once, and she looked like she was having a stroke. Wait a minute. I know what she's doing.",1
Rory,What?,1
Lorelai,"She's trying to be your pal now. Ah, that sneak. You spend one day together and she wants to know all about you. She's picturing you guys chatting about boys, and painting each other's toenails.",1
Lorelai,"Oh hey Kirk. You getting a cold? You know you should try that dinametichemphemital. Knocks it right out. Don't drive a forklift though, 'cause it'll make you drowsy.",1
Rory,"Oh wow, when's the last time you think Luke's been to a movie?",1
Lorelai,I don't know but I think the guy had to crank the projector by hand.,1
KIRK,Do you mind?,1
Lorelai,"Kirk, the movie hasn't even started yet.",1
KIRK,I like to have silence in order to cleanse my mental pallet and achieve calm before enjoying a motion picture.,1
Lorelai,"Oh you got that out of a book. Luke looks happy, doesn't he?",1
Rory,"Yeah, he looks happy.",1
Lorelai,"And they seem really right together, don't they?",1
Rory,Just right.,1
Lorelai,"Good, good, he deserves it. So I did the right thing by butting in the way I did.",1
Rory,You butted in for all the right reasons. You were concerned about a friend.,1
Lorelai,"So if Rachel turns out to be an evil fembot and murders Luke in his sleep, I'm not responsible am I?",1
Rory,Only in an intergalactic court.,1
Lorelai,Good. And Rachel seems really great. . .,1
KIRK,You are now officially disturbing not just me but every person in this theater.,1
Lorelai,"Kirk, you're the only one who's disturbed.",1
Lorelai,Uh! Shhh!,1
KIRK,Hello?,1
Lorelai,"Shhh! Shh! God, don't you hate that?",1
KIRK,,1
EMILY,"Hello, hello, hello.",1
Lorelai,"Wow, Mom, hi. Uh, check the rubbing alcohol.",1
EMILY,How was the drive?,1
Lorelai,The drive was fine.,1
EMILY,Good.,1
Lorelai,The foyer looks great.,1
EMILY,I have a surprise for you.,1
Lorelai,The rest of the house ran away?,1
EMILY,No.,1
Lorelai,No.,1
EMILY,"Rory, come w ith me.",1
Lorelai,,1
EMILY,Voila.,1
Rory,Oh my. Um Grandma what is this?,1
EMILY,This is your room.,1
Rory,What?,1
EMILY,"Since you've been spending so much time here lately, I thought you should have a special place all your own.",1
Rory,But you didn't have to do this.,1
EMILY,Do you like it?,1
Rory,"Yeah, it's beautiful.",1
Lorelai,Do you see the N'Sync poster?,1
Rory,Thank you Grandma.,1
EMILY,"You're welcome sweetheart. Now come on, lets go downstairs and see if dinner's ready. Are you coming?",1
Lorelai,You bought her CosmoGirl.,1
EMILY,Well the young girls enjoy the articles.,1
Lorelai,You bought boy band posters and Hello Kitty notepads.,1
EMILY,A lovely young girl at the store helped me pick them out.,1
Lorelai,You filled the room with sunflowers.,1
EMILY,Rory likes sunflowers.,1
Lorelai,I know Rory likes sunflowers.,1
EMILY,What is the matter Lorelai?,1
Lorelai,Nothing. I don't know. It's just a little weird that's all.,1
EMILY,Why is it weird to do something for my granddaughter?,1
Lorelai,"I don't know. I mean, it's not like you bought her a car. By the way, don't. It's a room and . . .you know, you're right. It's nice. I'm sorry. I'm just being silly.",1
EMILY,"Maybe you don't like the fact that now she has a place away from you, some place that's just her own.",1
Lorelai,I said I was fine.,1
EMILY,Or maybe its because its so large and spacious and has four solid walls around the bathtub.,1
Lorelai,What?,1
EMILY,"I mean, it may not be exciting or bohemian, but at least it doesn't have shovels propped up against the sofa either, now does it?",1
Lorelai,"I'm sorry. I missed the checkered flag, when did the argument start?",1
EMILY,Is it because it's not a shack in the woods? Or is it the proximity to me that's making it so uncomfortable for you?,1
Lorelai,What are you talking about?,1
EMILY,You hated us that much?,1
Lorelai,What?,1
EMILY,"You had to take that little girl away. That was bad enough. But to that? To live there, in a shed, like a hobo?",1
Lorelai,Who uses the word hobo anymore?,1
EMILY,"I saw it. I saw that horrible little pit you so proudly ran to. I saw what you chose over your own family. You would've lived in the gutter, in the street, it a cardboard box, anywhere as long as you didn't have to be near us, isn't that true?",1
Lorelai,Mom. .,1
EMILY,Isn't that true Lorelai?,1
Lorelai,"Mom, I was very young and I was very unhappy and I needed to be some place that wasn't here.",1
EMILY,,1
Rory,You're awfully quiet.,1
Lorelai,I am.,1
Rory,You hardly said anything at dinner.,1
Lorelai,I was chewing.,1
Rory,You didn't say anything on the ride home.,1
Lorelai,I was concentrating.,1
Rory,So. .,1
Lorelai,"Well, I feel I've gotten sloppy with this whole ""10 and 2"" hand position thing.",1
Rory,Mm hmm.,1
Lorelai,"Yeah seriously, the other day I caught myself doing a ""9 and 4.""",1
Rory,Mom. .,1
Lorelai,"Well, if left uncorrected, that can only lead to a ""6 and 12"", or worse yet, an ""8 and 11"", which is not only dangerous but damn uncomfortable.",1
Rory,Talk please.,1
Lorelai,I just wish sometimes that certain things could be different.,1
Rory,Like what?,1
Lorelai,"Like, um, wouldn't it be great if once, just once, I could make my mother hear me. I mean really hear me ev en if it was just for one second.",1
Rory,Are you talking about the room?,1
Lorelai,"The room, the potting shed, my entire life after age 6.",1
Rory,It's my fault.,1
Lorelai,How is it your fault?,1
Rory,I shouldn't have taken her there.,1
Lorelai,Oh Rory.,1
Rory,I just thought if she saw how we lived and how pretty it was with the lake and the swans. . .,1
Lorelai,That she'd do a happy dance?,1
Rory,That she'd feel included and then maybe . .,1
Lorelai,"The whole me running away thing wouldn't be such a big deal? Oh honey, me running away from them is always gonna be a big deal. There is nothing you can do to change that.",1
Rory,Can I ask you a question?,1
Lorelai,"Yes, I would date Steven Tyler.",1
Rory,Can I ask you a question whose answer wouldn't horrify me?,1
Lorelai,"Oh, go ahead.",1
Rory,Do you think you and Grandma will ever be able to talk about all the things you've gone through?,1
Lorelai,No.,1
Rory,You didn't even consider it.,1
Lorelai,I'm sorry. . . . No.,1
Rory,Why?,1
Lorelai,Because it would just end badly.,1
Rory,It doesn't have to.,1
Lorelai,It would be like the first 15 minutes of Saving Private Ryan but at least those guys got to be in France.,1
Rory,You've never tried.,1
Lorelai,"Oh no, that's not true. I have tried. I have tried my whole life. But my mother and I, we speak a different language. I talk, I think I'm being clear, and all she hears is 'Blah blah blah Ginger.'",1
Rory,"But if you won't talk and she won't listen, then how is anything ever gonna change?",1
Lorelai,,1
Lorelai,Thanks. Don't tell me you're closed?,1
LUKE,Would it change the outcome if I did?,1
Lorelai,No.,1
LUKE,Two coffees.,1
Rory,Yes please.,1
RACHELorelai,Any pie to go with that?,1
Lorelai,"Oh, pie!",1
Rory,We just had cake at Grandma's.,1
Lorelai,"Yeah, but that was crabby cake, let's have happy pie.",1
Rory,Have whatever you want as long as there's coffee.,1
LUKE,I'll put on a fresh pot.,1
RACHELorelai,"Hey, listen, I just wanna say thanks.",1
Lorelai,"Oh, for what?",1
RACHELorelai,For whatever it was you said to Luke the other day.,1
Lorelai,It was no big deal.,1
RACHELorelai,"It was a very big deal. I was sitting upstairs and suddenly he comes in, empties out his sock drawer and gives it to me.",1
Lorelai,Oh that's great. You got a drawer.,1
RACHELorelai,And a set of keys.,1
Lorelai,Well you can put the keys in the drawer.,1
RACHELorelai,He's accepting it. He's believing it. And it's all because of you.,1
Lorelai,"Actually, it's because of you.",1
RACHELorelai,I'm not gonna screw it up this time.,1
Lorelai,I know you won't.,1
RACHELorelai,Well I owe you one.,1
Lorelai,So you're gonna be in Stars Hollow for awhile then?,1
RACHELorelai,"Yeah, quite awhile.",1
Lorelai,"Wow, that's great.",1
RACHELorelai,Yeah. You want any ice cream with that pie?,1
Lorelai,Well I did get you a drawer.,1
RACHELorelai,"If I throw in a little hot fudge, you think you can weasel me half the closet?",1
Lorelai,I'll see what I can do.,1
RACHELorelai,Thank you.,1
Rory,Here.,1
Lorelai,Ah thanks.,1
Rory,Sure.,1
Rory,Huh. Does it taste different to you?,1
Lorelai,,1
Lorelai,So what do you think?,1
Rory,It's got a great view.,1
Lorelai,Yeah. And good highway access.,1
Rory,I love that window back in the . . .,1
Lorelai,"Library? Oh no, lobby. No, uh, bathroom?",1
Rory,I'd get that decided before you open.,1
SOOKIE,,1
Lorelai,We'll build a new kitchen Sookie.,1
SOOKIE,I'll need plenty of ventilation. And an area for an outdoor fireplace for barbecues. Plus storage. Where do these people put anything? Ooh! And a pantry. And a canning room. And I'd love to smoke our own meats.,1
Lorelai,Absolutely.,1
SOOKIE,"I don't know if this is gonna work. I mean, I have to do some floor plans. Where is that plumbing?",1
Rory,"Wow, your own inn.",1
Lorelai,"Cool, huh?",1
Rory,It's gonna be a really big job.,1
Lorelai,"Yeah. Well, maybe I'll get Rune to manage the place for me.",1
Rory,How's he doing?,1
Lorelai,He put a tip jar on the reservation desk.,1
Rory,Ah.,1
Lorelai,Michel tried to beat him senseless with the reservation book.,1
Rory,"Yeah, how did that go?",1
Lorelai,"Oh, Rune got away.",1
Rory,Really?,1
Lorelai,Well Michel can't run in new shoes.,1
Rory,So how long you think before you guys own this place?,1
Lorelai,"Oh sweetie, it's going to be a very very very long time.",1
Rory,You think it'll still be here?,1
Lorelai,,1

LORELAI,"So then he starts ripping my twenty dollar bill into like a million pieces. And I'm thinking to myself, there is a store full of people, why am I the one on line with the crazy magician? Okay, I'll cut to the end. So he couldn't put it back together again and he had to pay me back in quarters.",1
RORY,Very good story.,1
LORELAI,You look tired.,1
RORY,I just haven't been sleeping very well lately.,1
LORELAI,How come?,1
RORY,Just have a lot on my mind.,1
Lorelai,Anything I can do?,1
Rory,Flag down the coffee.,1
Lorelai,"Arm going up now. Honey, you gotta wake up. Wanna play?",1
Rory,"One, two, three?",1
Lorelai,I'll go first.,1
Rory,And one.,1
Lorelai,Pass.,1
Rory,Why?,1
Lorelai,Because I'm not Anna Nicole Smith. Next.,1
Posted,05/15/01 09:32,1
Rory,Two.,1
Lorelai,"Hmm, pass.",1
Rory,Why?,1
Lorelai,Because I'm not Mary Kay LeTourneau.,1
Rory,Okay.,1
LUKE,What are you looking for?,1
Lorelai,My new husband.,1
Rory,She's already passed up two perfectly good prospects.,1
Lorelai,But I'm feeling pretty good about number three.,1
LUKE,Do I want to know what you're doing?,1
Rory,"Hey, Luke came to the table, does that make him number three?",1
LUKE,No.,1
Lorelai,You don't even know what we're doing.,1
LUKE,The safest answer in anything involving the two of you is no.,1
Lorelai,"We're playing one, two, three, he's yours.",1
LUKE,I didn't ask.,1
Rory,"You can take the first guy that walks by, or if you decide to pass, assuming there's somebody better out there, you can take the next guy that walks by, or if you don't take him, you're automatically stuck with the third guy.",1
Lorelai,Got it?,1
LUKE,I'm not playing.,1
Lorelai,Well of course not. Its still my turn.,1
Rory,"Okay, guy number 3 is crossing the street right now.",1
LUKE,Why am I looking?,1
Lorelai,Because it's like a train wreck.,1
Lorelai,"Aww, no!",1
Rory,Daddy!,1
Lorelai,Not Kirk!,1
Rory,Maybe he'll buy me a p ony.,1
Lorelai,I wanna go back to the old guy.,1
LUKE,Congratulations man.,1
KIRK,"Uh, thank you.",1
KIRK,What?,1
Lorelai,Nothing,1
KIRK,"Okay, did somebody put the kick me sign on my back again?",1
KIRK,It wasn't funny last week and it's not funny now! I have asthma.,1
Rory,"Mom, quick he's leaving!",1
Lorelai,"Oh no, Kirk come back, I love you! Drat. All right, your turn.",1
Rory,"I don't know Mom. You already got Kirk, how's a girl to top that?",1
Lorelai,"You're right, he's yours.",1
Rory,And one.,1
Lorelai,"Okay, so, we should order.",1
Rory,"Yeah, ordering's good. INDEPENDENCE INN",1

MAX,Personal.,1
MAX,Is anybody there? Hello?,1
Lorelai,"Yes, Hello, hi.",1
MAX,Lorelai?,1
Lorelai,Max!,1

Lorelai,You must be very popular.,1

Lorelai,I want to play Wild Kingdom.,1
MAX,I am not making a gorilla sound.,1
Lorelai,"I'll tell you what color underwear I'm wearing. Had you considering the gorilla sound, didn't I?",1
MAX,Yup.,1
Lorelai,I'm good.,1
MAX,"Okay, I need you to be serious now.",1
Lorelai,Says the man with no pants.,1
MAX,We've been having these very successful phone calls for a couple of weeks now.,1
Lorelai,Yes we have.,1
MAX,And I think that all the talking has done us a lot of good.,1
Lorelai,Yes it has.,1
MAX,"So I was thinking that maybe this weekend instead of a phone call, we should have a date. Let's have dinner.",1
Lorelai,"Hmm, at the same restaurant?",1
MAX,At the same table.,1
Lorelai,Interesting idea.,1
MAX,I think its time.,1
Lorelai,You know what? So do I.,1
MAX,"Saturday night, 8 o'clock?",1
Lorelai,"Okay, wear some pants.",1
MAX,I make no promises.,1

RORY,"Well, this is good too.",1
LANE,He wasn't in there.,1
Rory,What?,1
LANE,Dean. He wasn't in there.,1
Rory,Oh.,1
LANE,In case you were wondering.,1
Rory,I wasn't.,1
LANE,"Okay, well I just thought you might be. So I mentioned it.",1
Rory,"Well, I'm not.",1
LANE,Okay.,1
Rory,Okay.,1
LANE,I just thought you'd might like to know for future reference that Dean is not in the store on Wednesdays so you can mark it down on that little list you're hiding from me that says where Dean is so that you can avoid him at any time.,1
Rory,I was not avoiding the market.,1
LANE,"Oh, my mistake.",1
Rory,I wasn't.,1
LANE,Okay. So what are you doing tonight?,1
Rory,"Well homework, and then homework, and if I get all that done in time, some homework. You?",1

Rory,Fun.,1
LANE,"Yes, science is fun.",1
Rory,Call you later?,1
LANE,Okay.,1

Lorelai,At the cat club?,1
LUKE,Yeah.,1
Lorelai,You had a couple things to pick up at the cat club?,1
LUKE,"Yeah I did, okay?",1
Lorelai,"Okay, I just never took you for a cat lover, a 97 year old woman, or. . . Hey what'd you buy?",1
LUKE,Nothing.,1
Lorelai,You've got a little bag there.,1
LUKE,I know that.,1
Lorelai,It's got a cat paw stamped on it and a little cat nip bow.,1
Lorelai,"Wise man. Wow, pot holders.",1
LUKE,Yes.,1
Lorelai,Little kitty pot holders. They meow.,1
LUKE,It's a present.,1
Lorelai,For someone you hate?,1
LUKE,"It's Rachel's birthday okay. And don't say anything, she doesn't want anybody to know. She hates birthdays.",1
Lorelai,Not as much as she's gonna hate these pot holders.,1
LUKE,"I don't know how to buy gifts, okay, I don't like to buy gifts. I don't like getting gifts. I mean, this whole give giving and getting process is completely insane.",1
Lorelai,The rant begins!,1
LUKE,"I mean suddenly, on a certain date, the level of my affection for a person isn't measured by the way that I treat them or what we share.",1
Lorelai,No!,1
LUKE,"I mean just because I didn't buy her furry slippers or a giant shoe tree, all of a sudden, I suck.",1
Lorelai,"Luke, stop. You know you cannot give her these pot holders.",1
LUKE,Yeah I know.,1
Lorelai,Why don't you go to the mall and walk around a little?,1
LUKE,"No, no malls.",1
Lorelai,Luke.,1
LUKE,I hate malls.,1
Lorelai,"Ladies and gentlemen, rant number two.",1
LUKE,"They underpay employees and overprice merchandise, they contribute to urban sprawl, they encourage materialism, and the parking's a horror. You drive in, you pay a buck, and even if you're only there for five. .",1
Lorelai,"Okay, Emma G oldman, I'll tell you what. I'll go for you.",1
LUKE,You're gonna shop for me?,1
Lorelai,I've got the day off tomorrow. I was gonna go anyway.,1
LUKE,You're serious?,1
Lorelai,"I'll go get a bunch of stuff, all returnable. I'll bring it to you. You can pick what you want and the rest I'll return. I'll do all the work; all you'll have to do is point.",1
LUKE,Point.,1
Lorelai,"One finger, preferably your index.",1
LUKE,I don't know.,1
Lorelai,"Luke, this is the first special occasion you and Rachel have shared since she's been back. Don't you want to give her something nice?",1
LUKE,Well I am taking her out to dinner.,1
Lorelai,Luke.,1
LUKE,"Yeah, I gotta get her something nice.",1
Lorelai,So then let me help.,1
LUKE,"All right, thank you.",1
Lorelai,"Oh, you're welcome.",1
LUKE,"Nothing too out there, okay? She's not into all that trendy stuff. She likes simple, clean nature, okay. Elephants, candles, okay. Oh hey, if you can find a candle shaped like an elephant, that would . .",1

LANE,You know we're breaking our agreement.,1
DEAN,What agreement?,1
LANE,Out agreement not to talk about Rory.,1
DEAN,We didn't have an agreement not to talk about Rory.,1
LANE,Well it was an unspoken agreement.,1
DEAN,Well it was really unspoken 'cause nobody spoke it.,1
LANE,Well I just think that if we have to study together it would be better if we didn't discuss Rory.,1
DEAN,Fine.,1
LANE,"Fine. You know, she can't go into the market.",1
DEAN,Why not?,1
LANE,Because you're there.,1
DEAN,Not on Wednesdays,1

DEAN,,1
LANE,Can I ask you a really personal question?,1

LANE,"Look, I'm just saying that I . . .",1
Rory,I should've called. I'm sorry.,1
LANE,Rory! I'm sorry I didn't tell you.,1
Rory,It doesn't matter.,1
LANE,I didn't think you'd want to know.,1
Rory,I got it.,1
LANE,"Rory stop. Okay, that's the opposite of stop.",1
Rory,"Lane, forget it. You didn't tell me, now I know. Life goes on.",1
LANE,Don't be mad.,1
Rory,,1
Lorelai,"Time to get up. Hey, I have a huge dilemma that I need your opinion on.",1
Rory,What!,1
Lorelai,Am I more beautiful today than I was yesterday?,1
Rory,Oh boy.,1
Lorelai,"I'm just not sure. I mean at first I looked in the mirror and I thought, well yes, definitely, huge improvement.",1
Rory,Can I have my pillow back?,1
Lorelai,"But then I thought maybe its not that I'm more beautiful today. Maybe I was just as beautiful yesterday, only I lacked the self-esteem to recognize it.",1
Rory,I'm gonna go take a shower.,1
Lorelai,"Well, hurry up and I'll drive you to school.",1
Rory,No thanks.,1
Lorelai,Why so charming this morning?,1
Rory,I had an annoying visit from the Stars Hollow wake up fairy. Where's my tie?,1
Lorelai,In your drawer.,1
Rory,I'm looking in the drawer.,1
Lorelai,Hmm. Check the living room,1
Rory,Why would my tie be in the living room?,1
Lorelai,"Because it's been seeing the doily on the coffee table. I'm sorry, I did not want you to find out this way.",1
Rory,"Don't take this personally, but get out.",1
Lorelai,"Okay, you're crabby. Do you know what the perfect cure for crabbiness is? A fabulous trip to the mall. Huh? What do you say? You can blow off school and come with me. We can shop, go to the movies, maybe talk a little.",1
Rory,No thanks.,1
Lorelai,"Come on, just this once. It might make you feel better.",1
Rory,I feel fine and I don't want to shop.,1
Lorelai,"Honey, I know you've been in a funk over Dean, but you have to try not to dwell on it all the time.",1
Rory,I'm gonna be late for school.,1
Lorelai,"Okay, then just meet me in town around four, and we'll get some Indian food and spoil our dinner. What do you say to that?",1
Rory,Whatever.,1
Lorelai,,1
LUKE,"Luke's. Yeah. Hang on. Okay. Cheeseburger. Fries well. Vanilla shake. Coke. Yes we have salad. One salad with cheese, one with ranch. Got it, 20 minutes. What the hell is this?",1
Lorelai,The results of my shopping trip all accomplished in two hours.,1
LUKE,Impossible.,1
Lorelai,I'm a savant.,1
LUKE,And everything's returnable.,1
Lorelai,"Yes, yes, now sit down and relax. Let me show you what I got.",1
LUKE,Can I have my credit card back?,1
Lorelai,Fine.,1
LUKE,Looks tired.,1
Lorelai,Where's Rachel?,1
LUKE,She's out running some er rands.,1
Lorelai,"Good. Okay, last week we were talking about Meryl Streep and the whole accent thing and Rachel said that she loved ""Out of Africa"" but she'd never read the book, remember?",1
LUKE,Nope.,1
Lorelai,"Okay, so I was like, ""Are you crazy? Isak Dinesen is amazing, I love her."" Which is kind of crap because I'd never read the book either, but Rory told me it was amazing, so I felt pretty confident in my recommen dation of ""Out of Africa"".",1
LUKE,You bought her a book?,1
Lorelai,"No, you bought her a book, to be put in her brand new camera bag.",1
LUKE,She's got a camera bag.,1
Lorelai,It's nylon.,1
LUKE,So?,1
Lorelai,"This one's leather. Beautiful leather. Feel it, smell it.",1
LUKE,I'm not gonna smell that bag.,1
Lorelai,"Fine, don't smell it, but trust me, she's gonna love it. Her old bag is falling apart so she was gonna get a new one eventually and now you will have beaten her to it.",1
LUKE,So it's practical.,1
Lorelai,And pretty!,1
LUKE,"Well, that seems right.",1
Lorelai,You like?,1
LUKE,Yeah thanks.,1
Lorelai,Good.,1
LUKE,What's all this?,1
Lorelai,"Well Luke, timing is a beautiful thing.",1
LUKE,It is?,1
Lorelai,"It is. So I'm at the mall, and I've already found Rachel's gifts, and I've had two sugar cinnamon pretzels and I'm buzzed on the sugar and jazzed about the purchases and I decide to take a victory lap through Bloomingdale's, and it just so happens that there was an amazing sale in the men's department. I mean gorgeous stuff. Look at this. Huh! Forty percent off! I got three different colors!",1
LUKE,For who?,1
Lorelai,For you.,1
LUKE,For me?,1
Lorelai,"Yeah. And then of course, beautiful pants. So soft, I don't know what this fabric is but I think I wanna have its baby.",1
LUKE,"Okay, hold on a minute here.",1
Lorelai,"Also, I got this fabulous belt to go with the sweater and the pants. Simple. Black. But look at the buckle.",1
LUKE,I don't need a belt.,1
Lorelai,"Great buckle! Sixty percent off, can you believe it?",1
LUKE,No I cant. Look. .,1
Lorelai,Oh and I also picked up a couple of shirty shirts in case you didn't have a nice one to go with your suit.,1
LUKE,What suit?,1
Lorelai,This one!,1
LUKE,Did no one at that mall notice that you were going through some sort of psychotic episode?,1
Lorelai,This suit. 175 percent off.,1
LUKE,You were not supposed to be shopping for me.,1
Lorelai,Well I thought you might like a little something new to wear when you take Rachel out tonight.,1
LUKE,Well thank you but take it back.,1
Lorelai,"Aw, just try them on.",1
LUKE,No way.,1
Lorelai,You might like how you look.,1
LUKE,I'm fine with the clothes I have.,1
Lorelai,"Okay, see this blazer? It was 175 thousand percent off.",1
LUKE,Why the sudden need to dress me?,1
Lorelai,I just thought you might look nice in some of these things and since they were 600 thousandpercent off. .,1
LUKE,No!,1
Lorelai,"Come on Luke, just try something on. How about this sweater?",1
LUKE,No!,1
Lorelai,"Okay, how about the pants? Pretty pants!",1
LUKE,I'm not trying anything on.,1
Lorelai,"Hey, its not like the lumberjack look will ever go out; it won't. But just once wouldn't it be nice not to be dressed like an extra from ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers""?",1
LUKE,Take it back.,1
Lorelai,"Come on. Just the jacket. Just once, be too sexy for your shirt and do a little dance on the catwalk.",1
LUKE,,1
MAX,"If we read his works in order we can see his progression from a narrative of clear simplicity to one of one of rich complexity. Now this is not homework but I strongly urge you, if you have not already read ""The Art of Fiction"", read it. It's a remarkable manifesto that contains basic trues that still apply to fiction in any form.",1
MAX,"All right, so Henry James, the man of the moment. Pick your book. Read it carefully. A full report on my desk one week from today. Any questions? Ms. Gilmore, any questions?",1
PARIS,Oops.,1
MAX,Ms. Gilmore?,1
Rory,Yes?,1
MAX,Did you hear the assignment?,1
Rory,"Um no, I'm sorry.",1
MAX,Henry James. Pick your novel. A report on my desk in one week. You got it?,1
Rory,Yes. I got it.,1
MAX,See you tomorrow.,1
PARIS,You didn't take one note. You resorting to the osmosis theory of learning?,1
Rory,Why do you care?,1
PARIS,"I don't, just making an observation.",1
Rory,"Great, we'll build a dome over you and jam a telescope in your head.",1
MAX,"Ms. Gilmore, can I talk to you for a minute?",1
Rory,"Oh, okay.",1
LOUISE,Tootles.,1
MADELINE,Ta.,1
PARIS,I'll get working on that dome.,1
MAX,"So, how are you?",1
Rory,Fine.,1
MAX,Seemed a little distracted today.,1
Rory,Oh. I didn't sleep well last night.,1
MAX,You've seemed to be a little distracted for quite a while now.,1
Rory,My grades are fine.,1
MAX,"I'm not concerned about your grades. I'm concerned about you. Look Rory, I know that you've been going through kind of a tough time lately and I just want you to know, if you want to talk, I'm here.",1
Rory,Tough time?,1
MAX,Breakups are really hard. We've all been there.,1
Rory,How do you know about that?,1
MAX,Your mom told me.,1
Rory,She what?,1
MAX,"Please, don't be upset at her. It just came out in one of our conversations. She was very concerned about you, very frustrated because. .",1
Rory,You've been talking to my mom?,1
MAX,Well yes.,1
Rory,Since when?,1
MAX,"Its been a couple, 3 weeks now I guess.",1
Rory,Are you dating?,1
MAX,"No, not really, I mean we were talking about possibly this weekend having dinner. You didn't know anything about this, did you? Well the look on your face makes perfect sense now. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to spring this on you like this.",1
Rory,"Its fine, don't worry about it.",1
MAX,I'm sure your mom was gonna tell you soon.,1
Rory,I'm sure too.,1
MAX,"Okay, so . .",1
Rory,Bus.,1

Lorelai,"Come on! LUKE : I hate you, very much.",1
Lorelai,Save the sweet talk for Rachel. Get out here!,1
Lorelai,"Excuse me sir, do you know where Luke is?",1
LUKE,Very funny.,1
Lorelai,"Oh my God, Luke, is that you?",1
LUKE,I feel ridiculous.,1
Lorelai,That's because you don't have the belt on. Here.,1
LUKE,What are you doing?,1
Lorelai,Its called accessorizing.,1
LUKE,"I can put a belt on by myself, thank you.",1
Lorelai,"Okay, sorry. Hmm.",1
LUKE,What?,1
Lorelai,I just. . .,1
LUKE,What?,1

COUNTERory,"Hey Fabio, I need the ketchup.",1
LUKE,Can you get that guy some ketchup?,1
Lorelai,Why me?,1
LUKE,Because if I spill any stuff on this I won't be able to return it.,1
Lorelai,You're not returning those clothes.,1
LUKE,Oh yes I am.,1
Lorelai,"Here, try on the suit again.",1
LUKE,I already tried it on twice.,1
Lorelai,"I know, but I want to see it with the black shirt.",1
LUKE,I'm not wearing a black suit with a black shirt.,1
Lorelai,Regis does.,1
LUKE,"Okay, you've won me over now.",1
Lorelai,At least try on the jacket again.,1
LUKE,"This is how you like your guys, all GQ'ed up huh?",1
Lorelai,"Its not GQ'ed up, its just a little less casual.",1
LUKE,And you don't like casual.,1
Lorelai,I like casual fine.,1
LUKE,Just not on me.,1
Lorelai,"No, it just adds variety. Its not lets make a new Luke, its lets see another side of the old one.",1
LUKE,Uh huh.,1
Lorelai,You missed a loop. Come here. What did you do?,1
LUKE,Oh hi.,1
Lorelai,"Oh hi. Uh, this is not what it looks like.",1
RACHELorelai,It looks like you're dressing him.,1

LUKE,There was a sale at Bloomingdale's and she. .,1
Lorelai,Six trillion percent off.,1

LANE,Hi.,1
Rory,Hi.,1
LANE,"I thought you might like some coffee, since you always do.",1
Rory,Thanks.,1
LANE,So this feels very awkward.,1
Rory,"You know, I'm a big girl Lane. I don't need you to protect me from things.",1
LANE,I just didn't want to make you any sadder than you already are.,1
Rory,How is you telling me that Dean is your study partner gonna make me sadder?,1
LANE,I don't even want to bring up his name around you.,1
Rory,That's crazy.,1
LANE,Have you seen your face when you mention Dean?,1
Rory,My face is fine.,1
LANE,Your face is not fine. Your face is far from fine.,1
Rory,I'll get over it.,1
LANE,Well you're not over it yet.,1
Rory,Maybe I'd get over it a little quicker if everyone weren't so busy running around trying to protect me from all the bad scary things in the world.,1
LANE,"Fine, I won't protect you anymore.",1
Rory,"Great, glad to hear it.",1
LANE,"Next time w e're walking down the street and you're about to walk head long into oncoming traffic, I'll just give you a little push.",1
Rory,Exactly what I'm talking about.,1
LANE,"And in the spirit of not protecting you anymore, I was gonna tell you that I couldn't study tonight because I had bible class, but that's not true. I have to meet Dean again.",1
Rory,Great. Thanks for the honesty.,1
LANE,And I'll probably have to see him again this weekend because the project's due on Monday.,1
Rory,Whatever. I don't care. I'll see you when I'll see you.,1
LANE,Fine.,1
Rory,Fine.,1
LANE,Bye.,1
Lorelai,"Hey, where's Lane going?",1
Rory,Away.,1
Lorelai,"Okay, you've been in this mood for a week now and while I love the unexpected ups and downs of motherhood, I've got to say I'm tired of Goofus and I'd like my Gallant back.",1
Rory,"You can't just say a normal sentence right? Just 'Hey, lets talk' is too dull for you.",1
Lorelai,Hey lets talk.,1
Rory,About what? Oh wait I know. How about you and Mr. Medina?,1
Lorelai,What?,1
Rory,I've heard you've gotten back together again.,1
Lorelai,Did you talk to Max?,1
Rory,He had me stay after class today to talk about my difficult breakup situation.,1
Lorelai,We are not dating. We had been talking and we just now decided to start dating.,1
Rory,Why didn't you tell me you'd been talking?,1
Lorelai,Because it was too much like the whole Todd and Nevina Cutler thing.,1
Rory,The what?,1
Lorelai,"When I was in junior high, I had a boyfriend, Todd something or other. Not a soul mate, but I was crazy about him and he dumped me. I was completely crushed and I could do nothing except lie around and cry and listen to Air Supply, very low point in my life. Two days after the breakup my best friend Nevina Cutler got back together with her boyfriend, Randy something or other, who had dumped her days before Todd dumped me. And she was so happy and gloaty and couldn't stop talking about how great it was that she had her boyfriend back that it made me feel horrible.",1
Rory,The end. Lets go.,1
Lorelai,"Look, I didn't want to be Nevina Cutler, okay? You were so miserable about Dean. What was I supposed to do? Walk in and say, 'Sorry about you and Dean but I got Max back and aren't we happy.' Would that have been good?",1
Rory,That would've been great.,1
Lorelai,"I was going to tell you, okay? I just wanted to give you some space and a chance to come up for air. I was trying to protect you, that's all. Hey.",1
Rory,"You know, actually, it doesn't matter whether you tell me about Max or not because you're just gonna break up again anyway.",1
Lorelai,Excuse me?,1
Rory,Well that's what you do best.,1
Lorelai,"Hey, stop right there.",1
Rory,"You'll break up, cry, get back together, break up. It doesn't really matter. I'd rather not have to keep track, so tell me w hen you're down to the final inning.",1
Lorelai,"You know what, that is way too snotty a thing even for alternate universe Rory to say. I'd like an apology.",1
Rory,Fine. I apologize. Let's go home.,1
Lorelai,"Yeah, lets go home an d try that apology again.",1
Rory,What are you doing?,1
Lorelai,We need light bulbs.,1
Rory,We're fine.,1
Lorelai,We're in the dark. It'll take a minute. I assume you won't come in.,1
Rory,Is it Wednesday?,1
Lorelai,No.,1
Rory,"Well then I can't, can I?",1
Lorelai,What does Wednesday have to do with anything?,1

RICHARD,"Well, who cares?",1
EMILY,"As president of the horticultural society, I have to care.",1
RICHRAD,The last thing I need is to spend four hours being bored out of my skull by the same people I'll be bored out of my skull by tomorrow night at the symphony fund-raiser.,1
EMILY,"Which reminds me, we need to get your other tux back from the cleaners tomorrow.",1
RICHARD,I'll be dead tomorrow. I plan on flinging myself off the roof tonight right in the middle of Pittie Salinger's opening speech.,1
EMILY,Pittie Salinger is a dear friend and you will be nice to her.,1

EMILY,I don't know what she's doing here. Just pay the man and I'll find out.,1
RICHARD,For Pete's sake.,1
EMILY,"Come in side. So tell me, what is going on?",1
Rory,I had a fight with mom.,1
EMILY,You had a fight with your mother?,1
Rory,I just couldn't take it anymore. I had to get out of there.,1
EMILY,Out of your house?,1
Rory,"Out of that house, that town. Everything. I just had to go.",1
RICHARD,He tacked on an extra five dollars just for waiting. Feel like I'm back in Prague. Do you want a cocktail?,1
Rory,No thanks.,1
EMILY,Richard!,1
RICHARD,"Oh, sorry, sorry. I'm just a little confused here.",1
Rory,You're all dressed up. You were going out. I'm so sorry!,1
RICHARD,"Oh, please, don't be.",1
EMILY,"It doesn't matter, Rory.",1
Rory,I'm sorry. Please go out. I didn't mean to ruin your evening. Oh I didn't think! I should've called.,1
EMILY,Now you calm down right now. You do not need to call before you come over here. You are welcome an y time.,1
RICHARD,Tonight especially.,1
EMILY,Do you want to talk about what happened?,1
RICHARD,"Emily, don't pry.",1
EMILY,"I'm not prying, Richard.",1
RICHARD,The girl obviously needs some peace.,1
EMILY,How do you know that?,1
RICHARD,I can tell.,1
EMILY,"Oh, you're a mind reader now, how nice. We'll get you a turban and a little booth by the train station.",1
RORY,Would it be okay if I stay here tonight?,1
EMILY,"Oh, well, of course.",1
RICHARD,You can stay here as long as you want.,1
Rory,Thanks.,1
EMILY,Would you like some dinner? I can get Rosa to make you something.,1
RORY,"No, I'd just like to go to bed if that's okay.",1
EMILY,"Of course. Whatever you like. Your room's all ready. There are pajamas in the dresser, and a new toothbrush in the bathroom. It's pink with sparkles. I thought you'd like it.",1
Rory,Thanks. Goodnight Grandpa.,1
RICHARD,Goodnight Rory.,1
EMILY,"Everything's going to be fine. Richard, say something encouraging.",1
RICHARD,"Uh Rory, I'm sorry you're upset, but I applaud your timing.",1
Rory,See you tomorrow.,1
RICHARD,"Emily, what is all this about?",1
EMILY,,1
Lorelai,"Mrs. Kim? It's Lorelai. Is Lane there? Well do you know where she is? Huh. That's unbelievable, you always know where she is. Um, the one time I need you to be crazy prison guard lady you're all, hey man whatever. Um, you know what, I will never be able to explain that to your satisfaction, so um could you just ask Lane to call me please when she gets back. I'm looking for Rory. No I don't know where she is. I uh. . don't ""ha"" me, you don't know where Lane is either.",1
Lorelai,Anything?,1
SOOKIE,"Patty hasn't seen her but she's been working all day. She's not at the library, and she's not at Luke's.",1
Lorelai,Where is she? Why didn't she leave a note? Dammit !,1
SOOKIE,Honey calm down.,1
Lorelai,But Rory doesn't take off. She knows it would make me crazy. She knows it would make me worry. I'm crossing over into panic now.,1
SOOKIE,Don't cross. Come back.,1
MAX,Hey.,1
Lorelai,Hey.,1
MAX,You find her?,1
Lorelai,"No, nothing. No one's seen her.",1
MAX,"Okay, um, what about that old boyfriend of hers?",1
Lorelai,Dean! Dean!,1
SOOKIE,On my way.,1
Lorelai,"Good suggestion. You get crisis points. Max, I'm freaking out.",1
MAX,"Its gonna be okay. Sookie's here, I'm here. We will find her.",1
Lorelai,Rory?,1
EMILY,I just thought I should let you know that Rory is here with us.,1
Lorelai,What?,1
EMILY,She arrived a few minutes ago.,1
Lorelai,She's there? Is she okay?,1
EMILY,She's fine. She asked to spend the night.,1
Lorelai,"Okay, um, she's there with you. So how did she get there?",1
EMILY,She took a cab.,1
Lorelai,"Well, let me talk to her.",1
EMILY,She seems quite upset. She said you'd had a fight.,1
Lorelai,We had a disagreement.,1
EMILY,She said fight.,1
Lorelai,"Will you just put her on the phone please, Mom.",1
EMILY,I think we should give her a little time to collect herself.,1
Lorelai,Thank you for your input. Can I please talk to my daughter?,1
EMILY,She went to her room Lorelai.,1
Lorelai,"Her room is here, Mom. I'm standing here looking at her room and she's not in it.",1
EMILY,"Lorelai, I did not come to your house and kidnap this child. She ran from you and she came here. She's tired and she's upset. Now I think we should just let her sleep and in the morning we can argue about how to best handle the situation. Maybe a little time away from each other will do both of you some good.",1
Lorelai,I'll pick her up in the morning.,1
EMILY,She has school tomorrow and her school is ten minutes from here.,1
Lorelai,I'll pick her up after school.,1
EMILY,"Why don't you just call tomorrow when she gets back from school? Make sure she wants to go. You don't want to haul her back home just to have her jump in a cab again, do you?",1
Lorelai,I'll talk to you tomorrow.,1
EMILY,Good night Lorelai.,1
MAX,So?,1
Lorelai,She's with my parents in Hartford.,1
MAX,Good.,1
Lorelai,Good?,1
MAX,Bad?,1
Lorelai,"Bad, very bad.",1
MAX,She's safe.,1
Lorelai,She's with my mother. No one is safe with my mother.,1
MAX,She needed some space.,1
Lorelai,"No, that house is not safe. It's like the Amityville Horror without all the good times.",1
MAX,If it's that bad maybe you should go get her.,1
Lorelai,"No, she wanted to get away from me . She wants to be alone. Give her her space.",1
MAX,Are you okay?,1
Lorelai,I can't believe she left me to go there. We used to always be able to work this stuff out.,1
MAX,What did you two fight about?,1
Lorelai,Oh you.,1
MAX,Me?,1
Lorelai,"Well it started with the you and the fact that I hadn't told her we were talking again, but I know that was only part of it because she's been in such a bad place lately with this whole Dean thing and so, I don't know, I guess it was coming. I just wish she hadn't run away.",1
MAX,"Hey, she will be back and you two will work everything out.",1
Lorelai,"You're good at the comforting thing, you know?",1
MAX,Thank you.,1
Lorelai,Do you want some coffee?,1
MAX,Sure. Can I ask you a question?,1
Lorelai,I think you've earned it.,1
MAX,Why didn't you tell Rory about us?,1
Lorelai,"Oh, she was just so upset about Dean, I didn't think it was the best time to give her my happy news.",1
MAX,Okay. But you've told other people?,1
Lorelai,Like what other people?,1
MAX,I don't know. Friends. Sookie.,1
Lorelai,"Um, no actually, I haven't.",1
MAX,Any reason?,1
Lorelai,Just hasn't come up.,1
MAX,It hasn't?,1
Lorelai,No.,1
MAX,You're not by any chance avoiding talking to people about it are you?,1
Lorelai,"No, Max, come on.",1
MAX,It just seems a little strange to me.,1
Lorelai,Why is it strange?,1
MAX,Well we've been talking for at least two weeks. I would've thought at some point in there it would've come up.,1
Lorelai,"You just don't say to people out of the blue, 'Hey, Max and I are talking again.' I mean, I was just waiting for it to come up naturally.",1
MAX,"Well yes, but somehow for me it managed to come up naturally within two days at three different times.",1
Lorelai,Well you're obviously a much better people person than I am.,1
MAX,I just want to know if there's a reason why you don't want people to know. . .,1
Lorelai,Max!,1
MAX,. . .then we should talk about that.,1
Lorelai,There's no reason.,1
MAX,Are you sure?,1
Lorelai,Yes I'm sure.,1
MAX,Okay.,1
Lorelai,Do you believe me?,1
MAX,"If you said there's no reason, there's no reason.",1
Lorelai,There's no reason.,1
MAX,So you've said.,1
Lorelai,So I mean.,1
MAX,Okay.,1
Lorelai,All right.,1
MAX,That's fine.,1
Lorelai,"Uh, I should page Sookie and tell her that Rory's okay.",1
MAX,,1
Rory,Good morning.,1
EMILY,"Rory, good morning.",1
Rory,"Hey Grandma, any thoughts on where my skirt might be?",1
EMILY,"I gave it to Rosa to press. Here sit down, have some breakfast. Your skirt will be done by the time you're finished.",1
Rory,Okay.,1
EMILY,"Now, we have eggs, fruit, toast, pancakes, blintzes.",1
Rory,Anything would be fine.,1
EMILY,"Well, what do you usually eat?",1
Rory,Mostly I just grab a Pop Tart.,1
EMILY,That sounds delicious. I'll have Rosa whip one up for you.,1
Rory,"No, eggs would be great.",1
EMILY,I'll go tell her.,1
Rory,"So Grandpa, what's new in the world today?",1
RICHARD,"As usual, it's going to hell in a hand basket.",1
Rory,Its nice to have something you can always count on.,1
RICHARD,It is at that. Would you like part of the paper? : Please.,1
EMILY,Your eggs will be right out.,1
Rory,Thanks.,1
EMILY,So did you sleep well?,1
Rory,The bed was very comfortable.,1
EMILY,But you didn't sleep well?,1
Rory,"No I did, I just. . .",1
EMILY,I talked to your mother last night. I told her you were going to stay here. She said she'd call this afternoon.,1
Rory,Was she mad?,1
EMILY,She was concerned. So do you get your lunch at school or do you bring it with you? Because Rosa made a fabulous leg of lamb yesterday. I bet it'd make a wonderful sandwich.,1
RICHARD,Take her up on that. It is good. And demand a slice of strudel.,1
Rory,Okay. I demand some strudel.,1
EMILY,Good. So what's going on at school today?,1
Rory,"Uh, I have a test in Spanish.",1
RICHARD,Hmm. Are you prepared?,1
Rory,Oh yeah. I like Spanish. Biology on the other hand . . .,1
RICHARD,"Oh, I'm still waiting for the day when my knowledge of the inner workings of a frog's intestinal system can be applied to my work in the insurance industry.",1
Rory,Perhaps if you were insuring the frog.,1
RICHARD,Ah.,1
Rory,Thank you. This looks great.,1
EMILY,Well good.,1
Rory,Thanks again for letting me stay.,1
EMILY,It's nice having you here. You got your grandfather to put down his newspaper at the breakfast table. That's a first.,1
RICHARD,"Aw now, Emily.",1
EMILY,,1
LUKE,"Geez, what happened to you?",1
Lorelai,A happy 'how do you do' to you too.,1
LUKE,"Sorry, you just look bad.",1
Lorelai,Well I didn't get much sleep last night.,1
LUKE,Why not?,1
Lorelai,Rory and I had a fight and she ran away.,1
LUKE,What! Where! Did you. .,1
Lorelai,She's fine. She's at my mother's.,1
LUKE,"Geesh, throw that information in with the first part. You'll scare a person to death.",1
Lorelai,"You know, I got in my car three times to go get her. I drove halfway there and drove back, drove halfway there and drove back. I actually ran of gas driving halfway there and back.",1
LUKE,She'll cool off and come home.,1
Lorelai,I know. Just breaking up with Dean has been so hard on her.,1
LUKE,Yeah.,1
Lorelai,"I just hate that she's going through this. I mean, she's such a good kid. She's so nice to everyone, she cares about everyone. And she's walking around in this unbelievable pain and there's nothing I can do about it. She still won't talk to me. She won't tell me what happened.",1
LUKE,I'll tell you what happened. That Dean kid is a jerk and he finally let her know it.,1
Lorelai,I wish I could just pinch his head right off.,1
LUKE,I'll help.,1
Lorelai,"I warned him. I warned him when I first met him, if he hurt her . . Ah. Maybe I could key his car.",1
LUKE,"Or better yet, you can key Taylor's car and tell him Dean did it.",1
Lorelai,Yeah. That'd be good.,1
LUKE,"You can key Taylor's car, tell him Dean did it and also tell him that Dean littered and walks his dog without a leash.",1
Lorelai,He'll run him out of town.,1
LUKE,Good.,1
Lorelai,All right. I should go. Rory's probably out of school by now and I want to be home in case she decides to call.,1
LUKE,Coffee's on the house.,1
Lorelai,"Oh thanks. Hey, is that the belt I bought you?",1
LUKE,Oh yeah yeah yeah. The old one broke.,1
Lorelai,"Oh, lucky you happened to have a spare.",1
LUKE,,1
Lorelai,Got a minute?,1
DEAN,"Actually I'm, uh. .",1
Lorelai,I just want to tell you that I think you are scum.,1
DEAN,Gee thanks.,1
Lorelai,"You are gonna be hard pressed to find another girl as fantastic as Rory, you know that? She is beautiful and she is smart and she did not deserve to be treated that way by you.",1
DEAN,Treated what way?,1
Lorelai,I thought you were a good guy. I thought you were going to make her happy. I'm such an idiot that I actually thought you were a good pick. But I was wrong and I hate to be wrong.,1
DEAN,"You know, I am sick and tired of everyone blaming this thing on me. I mean, you and the whole stupid town looking at me like I'm a criminal. I say 'I love you' and she just sits there and I'm the jerk? I'm the bad guy?",1
Lorelai,What?,1
DEAN,,1
Lorelai,Where is she?,1
EMILY,I thought you were gonna call.,1
Lorelai,Where is she mom?,1
EMILY,I haven't had any time to prepare her for this.,1
Lorelai,Mom where is she?,1
EMILY,Upstairs in her room.,1
Lorelai,Thank you.,1
EMILY,She got home from school but she just went right upstairs. Now she didn't want a snack but I had Rosa make her one anyway. I haven't checked to see if she's eaten it. She had a decent breakfast this morning but she did seem a little tired and when I went into her bathroom the aspirin bottle was out so I assume she had a headache. Now I don't know if it was last night or. .,1
Lorelai,"Excuse me, Mr. Cosell. I appreciate the play by play but I just want to talk to my daughter now.",1
EMILY,Do you want me to go in there with you?,1
Lorelai,More than anything.,1
EMILY,Well try and be nice.,1
Lorelai,,1
Lorelai,Hey.,1
Rory,Mom!,1
Lorelai,"Okay, so I thought when you said, 'I'll see you at home,' you meant our home. My mistake.",1
Rory,I'm so sorry.,1
Lorelai,Its okay.,1
Rory,All those things. .,1
Lorelai,I know.,1
Rory,And then the. . .,1
Lorelai,Its no big deal,1
Rory,I'm just so. .,1
Lorelai,"I know, I know, I know. So last time I saw you you were headed home, you wanna fill in the blanks?",1
Rory,I don't know. I just snapped and I got sick of everything. I wanted to go anywhere.,1
Lorelai,So you picked hell?,1
Rory,It was the first place that came to mind.,1
Lorelai,"I respect that. Listen, the need to run is a feeling I am very well acquainted with. But we have to be able to talk always. No matter how mad or upset we get with each other our particular special thing only works if we agree to that, get it?",1
Rory,I get it.,1
Lorelai,"Good. Rory, tell me w hat happened with you and Dean.",1
Rory,I don't want to talk about it.,1
Lorelai,Well I do.,1
Rory,Why?,1
Lorelai,Because I had a little chat with him today.,1
Rory,What? Why?,1
Lorelai,"Well, because I was upset and I was in the mood to do a little yelling.",1
Rory,You didn't.,1
Lorelai,Did.,1
Rory,No.,1
Lorelai,"There he was stacking cookies and I'm railing on him about what a great kid you are and how it sucked that he dumped you, and then he said that he told you he loved you and I started feeling a little stupid.",1
Rory,He did tell me.,1
Lorelai,And you didn't say anything?,1
Rory,No.,1
Lorelai,Well that must have been rough on him.,1
Rory,He looked so hurt. I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to hurt him.,1
Lorelai,I know.,1
Rory,I just got scared and I sat there.,1
Lorelai,"I understand. You know, I'm still learning this stuff too and since I'm still learning, I think I haven't thought enough about what I'm supposed to be teaching you.",1
Rory,What are you talking about?,1
Lorelai,"I'm talking about my own personal lack of commitment skills. I mean, look, I love that you have my eyes and my coffee addiction and my taste in music and movies, but when it comes to love and relationships, I don't necessarily want you to be like me. I would hate to think that I raised a kid who couldn't say I love you.",1
Rory,Mom.,1
Lorelai,"I'm not even talking specifically about Dean. I mean just generally in life. For example, say you're dating Taylor Hanson.",1
Rory,Why am I dating Taylor Hanson?,1
Lorelai,"It's a hypothetical scenario, go with it. So, uh, you and Taylor have been seeing each other pretty regularly. .",1
Rory,How did I meet Taylor Hanson?,1
Lorelai,"You went to his concert, you got backstage, your eyes met across the crowd and you've been seeing each other ever since.",1
Rory,Hanson's still together?,1
Lorelai,They're the new Bee Gees. So. .,1
Rory,And why would you not stop me from going to a Hanson concert?,1
Lorelai,"Hey, someone's trying to make a point here.",1
Rory,Sorry. Go ahead.,1
Lorelai,"So you and Taylor have been dating for awhile, and things are great, and, um, you're happy, and you feel all those crazy mushy things that people feel when they're in love. I want you to be able to say to him, Taylor, I love you.",1
Rory,"Okay, can we pick a new hypothetical 'cause this one's wigging me out.",1
Lorelai,"My point is that it's scary to be in love, that much I know, but it's also wonderful and special and if you can't say it or fully express it then you're never gonna be able to experience it and I want you to experience everything that's great because you're so great. Are you hearing me?",1
Rory,"Yeah, I'm hearing you.",1
Lorelai,"I'm not saying you say ""I love you"" at the drop of a hat. It has to be right and real and it has to take a lot of thought. But someday with someone it will be right. I want you to be ready for that moment when it happens.",1
Rory,Are you ready for that moment when it happens?,1
Lorelai,,1
Rory,Thank you guys so much.,1
EMILY,It was our pleasure.,1
Lorelai,What do I owe you for the cab?,1
RICHARD,"Oh, don't worry about that.",1
Rory,Thanks for sharing the paper.,1
RICHARD,Anytime.,1
Lorelai,And thank you mom.,1
EMILY,Of course. She's our granddaughter.,1
Lorelai,"All right, we'll see you tomorrow night.",1
EMILY,Seven o'clock.,1
Lorelai,"Oh really, is it seven 'cause I wasn't sure if. .",1
EMILY,Goodbye Lorelai.,1
Lorelai,Bye.,1
RICHARD,Well it looks like it's just the two of us again.,1
EMILY,,1
Rory,I was almost tempted to see if she could make a Pop Tart.,1
Lorelai,"Wow, home cooked breakfast, homema de lunch, I'm trying to remember why I left there. Oh yeah, my parents.",1
Rory,"Funny, funny girl. Hey, let me out here.",1
Lorelai,Oh okay.,1
Rory,I'll meet you back at the house.,1
Lorelai,Excuse me?,1
Rory,I'll show up this time.,1
Lorelai,,1
MAX,Hello?,1
Lorelai,,1
MAX,Lorelai. .,1
Lorelai,"After I've called everyone in here, I'm going to makes sure to spread the word at the inn.",1
MAX,Uh huh.,1
Lorelai,I thought I'd put little notices in everyone's,1
rooms,"""Welcome to the Independence Inn. Max and Lorelai are back together.""",1
MAX,Can I see you after your dinner tomorrow night?,1
Lorelai,Oh I don't know. I have a lot of phone calls to make. Ooh! The Internet! Let's go global!,1
MAX,Good night Lorelai.,1
Lorelai,Goodnight.,1

LORELAI,Hey!,1
RORY,What?,1
LORELAI,You are not sleeping through this.,1
RORY,Through what?,1
LORELAI,The freaking Blue Man Group is outside our house!,1
RORY,I was sleeping through it!,1
LORELAI,It had to have woken you up.,1
RORY,,1
LORELAI,Hey.,1
LUKE,Hey.,1
LORELAI,How are you today?,1
LUKE,"Good, how are you?",1
Posted,05/22/01 12:36,1
LORELAI,"Good, good. What are you doing?",1
LUKE,Fixing your porch rail.,1
LORELAI,That's right. You are. You're fixing my porch rail. . . . At six thirty in the morning!,1
LUKE,It was the only time I could do it.,1
LORELAI,Why? Why?,1
LUKE,It was broken. I noticed last time I was here. It could hurt somebody.,1
LORELAI,"Luke, we sleep around here. Okay, we like it. It makes us pretty and keeps us from k*lling our crazy friends.",1
LUKE,You're gonna wake the neighbors.,1
LORELAI,UGH! Could you pound one more thing while you're out here? Your head! And a for-sale sign on the lawn because we're moving. So that's two things. The sign and your head. And in that order 'cause otherwise you'll be too dizzy to do the sign thing.,1
LORELAI,Ugh. Oh sh**t. RORY!,1
LUKE,You locked out?,1
LORELAI,You don't exist! RORY!,1
LUKE,You shouldn't have closed the door.,1

MICHELorelai,I cannot.,1
LORELAI,"Michel, we've been over this, we all cover the phone, that includes you.",1
MICHELorelai,"Don't misunderstand. I want to answer it, I truly did, but today, today I am suffering from ennui.",1
LORELAI,Ennui?,1
MICHELorelai,"Severe ennui. You know what ennui is, yes?",1
LORELAI,"Yes. Um, Webster's defines ennui as a lazy soon to be out of work French concierge who won't answer the phone.",1
MICHELorelai,"Look, I've had my peace with the fact that everyone who calls here is a notch above brain dead, and that the pennies I am thrown each week are in exchange for me dealing with these people in a nonviolent manner. And usually that is fine, but today, sorry lady, I have ennui.",1
LORELAI,"So, you're sleepy?",1
MICHELorelai,It's a metaphysical angst.,1
LORELAI,"So, you wanna go beddy bye?",1
MICHELorelai,"You make light, it increases my ennui.",1
LORELAI,,1
LORELAI,"I need coffee. Extra strong. Double cafe. Triple cafe. No, forget the cafe. Throw in the whole cow and serve it to this man right here! What's wrong with you?",1
SOOKIE,"I don't know. It might sound a little weird, but I think I've got . .",1
LORELAI,Oh no.,1
SOOKIE,Ennui.,1
LORELAI,You explained ennui to her.,1
MICHELorelai,"She asked me w hat was wrong with me earlier, so I told her.",1
LORELAI,"Michel, you know that Sookie ends up thinking she's coming down with whatever illness other people else have.",1
SOOKIE,Nuh uh!,1
LORELAI,Oh no? What was that whole conversation last week when I had to convince you you didn't have a prostate.,1
SOOKIE,Oh. How is Al?,1
LORELAI,Hello?,1
MAX,Is this a bad time?,1
LORELAI,"For the hotel industry, but not for you.",1
MAX,"I've only got a second, but I wanted to say hi.",1
LORELAI,Hi.,1
MAX,And thank you for last night.,1
LORELAI,"It was a good night, wasn't it?",1
MAX,Several novels will be written about it.,1
LORELAI,"I say we do it again, and next time, I'll be the gypsy queen.",1
MAX,Do you know the more I see you the more I want to see you.,1
LORELAI,Same here.,1
MAX,It's like a vicious circle.,1
LORELAI,It's an achy feeling.,1
MAX,Like withdrawal pains.,1
LORELAI,Totally distracting.,1
MAX,Completely wonderful. Oh I gotta go.,1
LORELAI,"No, don't!",1
MAX,Okay.,1
LORELAI,I gotta go.,1
MAX,Don't.,1
LORELAI,Okay.,1
MAX,This would be another example of a vicious circle.,1
LORELAI,So we should both go.,1
MAX,We definitely should.,1

MAX,Hang up. . .,1
LORELAI,"No, you hang up!",1

SOOKIE,,1
LORELAI,"I had the weirdest dream last night. We were in our house, but it wasn't our house, it was a Kentucky Fried Chicken.",1
RORY,I'm hooked.,1
LORELAI,"I had to get dressed, but my clothes were in the back. And the guy manning the giant oil vat would not let me though.",1
RORY,"Oh my God! That's so weird. When you said oil vat, that just reminded me, I had this dream last night we were swimmin g in a pool, only it wasn't water, it was like oil or honey or something.",1
LORELAI,Hey.,1
RORY,What?,1
LORELAI,You totally did the thing.,1
RORY,What thing?,1
LORELAI,"The thing where one person is describing their dream and it reminds the other person about their dream, and suddenly it's all about their dream and the first person is just standing there like, um, hey man, what about my dream.",1
RORY,"I'm sorry, the oil vat guy was being mean.",1
LORELAI,Yes. And we knew him. He used to live in town. He was that guy who used to run the auto body shop before Maven Hughes bought it. Remember him?,1
RORY,No.,1
LORELAI,"Yes, you do. He's really skinny",1
RORY,Peter Stringbean?,1
LORELAI,No. That was the tall circus freaky guy who worked for him. This was the owner guy. What was his name?,1
RORY,I don't know.,1
LORELAI,Yes you do. Come on. Ugh. It's gonna bug me all day. He was short and fat and his name was. . .,1
RORY,Johnny McShort-and-Fat.,1
LORELAI,,1
LORELAI,"Hey, who was the guy who used to run the auto body shop?",1
LUKE,The Stretch Cunningham guy?,1
LORELAI,"No, the d*ck Tracy guy.",1
LUKE,"Big, always had a half-smoked cigar in his mouth?",1
LORELAI,,1
LUKE,Always had an ING at the end.,1
LORELAI,"Yes. Uh, Banning.",1
LUKE,Glanning.,1
LORELAI,Dunning.,1
LUKE,That's it.,1
LORELAI,"Ooh! Hey! Jim Dunning was the d*ck Tracy guy. Jim Dunning, that's the d*ck Tracy guy.",1
LORELAI,"Oh. The Dean box. Okay, I know I was supposed to throw it away, but I couldn't. I mean, you're young and your head's all weird, and you don't have any perspective because of that whole young weird headed thing, so just please listen to me before you get mad. You're gonna want that stuff one day, when you're old and married, and looking back and thinking, I certainly had an interesting life. And then you can pull out all your old boyfriend boxes. Which is good, because I threw away stuff I'd k*ll to have today. Look, I put it in with the Max box so they could chat and keep each other company and commis erate about how they had Gilmore girl and lost a Gilmore girl and . . .sorry.",1
RORY,,1
LANE,"What I wanted to say was, Janie Fertman, you are a vacuous bimbo who will be turning letters as a profession one day. And the only way you'll know which letter to turn is when it dings and lights up. And I have no desire to stop and talk to you. Ever. But what I said was 'what Janie?' And then she goes, 'You're cheerleader material.' Cheerleader material! Just like that. I couldn't believe it! I almost went full matrix on her. Have you heard a word I've said?",1
RORY,No.,1
LANE,I resent that. I'm a witty conversationalist.,1
LANE,What?,1
RORY,I'm going in.,1
LANE,You can't.,1
RORY,I'm going in.,1
LANE,It's Thursday afternoon.,1
RORY,I know.,1
LANE,He works on Thursday afternoons.,1
RORY,I know.,1
LANE,We're talking you know who.,1
RORY,I know.,1
LANE,Oh my god!,1
RORY,Calm down.,1
LANE,Oh my god!,1
RORY,You're making a spectacle.,1
LANE,You're getting back together with Dean!,1
RORY,If you keep jumping like that I'm gonna videotape it and send it to Janie Fertman as your cheerleader audition.,1
LANE,When did this happen?,1
RORY,"Nothing's happened. I don't even know what I'm doing exactly. Or what he's thinking or whether he's burned all my letters and pictures or hates me or what, but I'm going in.",1
LANE,"I so encourage this. I love you, but you've been mopey, dopey, and about 12 other melancholy dwarves for the past 5 weeks and I miss the old Rory.",1
RORY,I miss the old me too.,1
LANE,And I've been feeling bad for the new Rory.,1
RORY,Well she's staging a comeback.,1
LANE,And may it be more successful than Peter Frampton's.,1
RORY,Wish me luck.,1
LANE,,1
TAYLORory,Rory.,1
RORY,"Oh, Taylor, you scared me.",1
TAYLORory,What are you doing? You're walking around like . . .,1
RORY,Like what?,1
TAYLORory,"Dare I say, like a shoplifter.",1
RORY,"Oh, I'm not here to shoplift.",1
TAYLORory,"Well, you currently fit 4 of the 8 characteristics.",1
RORY,I do?,1
TAYLORory,"You're alone, you look nervous, you're meandering in an aimless fashion, and you're wearing a baggy coat.",1
RORY,"Oh, I tend to run cold.",1
TAYLORory,So what are you here for?,1
RORY,I'm looking for your checkout boy. I had a question and I didn't want to bother you.,1
TAYLORory,"He's stacking on six. Over here please! Mikey, this is Ms. Gilmore, she needs some help. Take care Rory. Watch her.",1
MIKEY,Yeah?,1
RORY,"Hi. Uh, I was just wondering, do you like working here?",1
MIKEY,What?,1
RORY,"I mean, do you enjoy the whole boxboy trade as a profession?",1
MIKEY,No.,1
RORY,,1
LANE,Well?,1
RORY,He's not there.,1
LANE,But he always works Thursday.,1
RORY,I guess he's taking Thursday afternoons off now. That's not good.,1
LANE,How is that not good?,1
RORY,Because that means he's moved on.,1
LANE,What are you talking about?,1
RORY,Obviously he's met one of those Thursday afternoon girls.,1
LANE,What's a Thursday afternoon girl?,1
RORY,They're those slutty girls that get guys to switch their Thursday afternoons with another checkout guy so they can go do slutty Thursday afternoon things.,1
LANE,"Okay, you're reading way too much into this.",1
RORY,I shouldn't have gone in.,1
LANE,No it's good to go in.,1
RORY,Taylor thinks I'm casing the place. Like I would ever shoplift there.,1
LANE,You have shoplifted there.,1
RORY,"Lane, I'm gonna ask you a question and I want you to be more honest with me than you've ever been before in your life. Have you ever seen him with another girl at school?",1
LANE,No.,1
RORY,Lane.,1
LANE,No.,1
RORY,"You'd tell me, right?",1
LANE,"Yes. No, I wouldn't because it would break your heart, but I haven't.",1
RORY,You swear? On the life of the lead singer of Blur?,1
LANE,"On the soul of Nico, I swear to you that I have not seen Dean with another girl.",1
RORY,Okay.,1
LANE,He's miserable.,1
RORY,Fine.,1
LANE,Suicidal.,1
RORY,Good.,1
LANE,And in desperate need of haircutting.,1
RORY,,1
TRISTIN,You should decorate this thing.,1
RORY,I did.,1
TRISTIN,Well I mean with something other than a bunch of dead black and white women.,1
RORY,"What, like curtains?",1
TRISTIN,You know what I mean. I did mine up.,1
RORY,"Yeah, I saw that. The naked picture of the Siamese twins is particularly classy.",1
TRISTIN,You know what these are?,1
RORY,They look like tickets.,1
TRISTIN,To PJ Harvey.,1
RORY,"Wow, you have good taste. I'll give you that.",1
TRISTIN,"You're into PJ Harvey, right?",1
RORY,"Yeah, how'd you know?",1
TRISTIN,"Why, I'm all knowing.",1
RORY,How Godlike of you.,1
TRISTIN,One of these is for you.,1
RORY,"Oh, I don't think we should go to a concert together.",1
TRISTIN,Reason?,1
RORY,It would seem like a date.,1
TRISTIN,Well it would seem like a date because it would be a date.,1
RORY,I can't date you Tristin.,1
TRISTIN,Well I give you permission.,1
RORY,And on that humble note.,1
MADELINE,"Oh, Rory, favor, big one. Look at the face.",1
RORY,"Sure, what?",1
MADELINE,"Can I get your biology notes from Tuesday, I was out.",1
LOUISE,To lunch.,1
MADELINE,Please.,1
RORY,"Sure, I have them at home. I can bring them later.",1
MADELINE,"Thank you, thank you, thank you.",1
PARIS,One more and you're done.,1
MADELINE,Thank you.,1
MADELINE,So I've decided I'm now completely into Judy Garland. Did you see the TV movie? Pretty intense.,1
LOUISE,I think they used my mother's medicine cabinet in that.,1
MADELINE,She was the Courtney Love of her day.,1
PARIS,Show me a t rend and I'll show you Madeline.,1
MADELINE,Judy Garland is trendy?,1
PARIS,Completely.,1
LOUISE,She was neo-addict retro chic.,1
MADELINE,No one tells me these things.,1
PARIS,Hi.,1
TRISTIN,Hey.,1
MADELINE,"Ooh, what are those?",1
TRISTIN,"Oh, PJ Harvey tickets.",1
LOUISE,Really?,1
MADELINE,Cool.,1
LOUISE,Who are you going with?,1
TRISTIN,Rory.,1
PARIS,What?,1
LOUISE,Rory's going out with you?,1
TRISTIN,"Yes, she is.",1
MADELINE,"Wow, I didn't think she liked him.",1
LOUISE,Neither did I.,1
LOUISE,"Hm, do you think she's mad?",1
PARIS,"What are you two waiting for, a tram? Let's move!",1
MADELINE,,1
PATTY,"Flutter flutter, quick quick, flutter flutter, quick quick. And your hearts are broken, your prince has betrayed you, you've been shot with an arrow, and now . . you're dead.",1
LORELAI,Hi Patty.,1
RACHELorelai,Lorelai.,1
LORELAI,Hey Rachel.,1
RACHELorelai,"Hey, have you seen Luke around?",1
LORELAI,"Oh, he's probably at the diner.",1
RACHELorelai,"Nope, he's supposed to be at the diner, but he's not.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, well . .",1
RACHELorelai,"We were supposed to meet for lunch, but he didn't show.",1
LORELAI,Oh.,1
RACHELorelai,Again.,1
LORELAI,Ah.,1
RACHELorelai,I made tuna.,1
LORELAI,Nice.,1
RACHELorelai,"Yeah, yeah, he usually comes back upstairs for a break between lunch and dinner, but recently he's been other places. Uh, your place actually.",1
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, well, Rachel, he's just fixing some things.",1
RACHELorelai,I know.,1
LORELAI,"The porch rail, a couple roof shingles, then the porch rail again after he fell off the roof onto to the porch rail.",1
RACHELorelai,"Yeah, yeah, he's been telling me",1
LORELAI,Good.,1
RACHELorelai,"Look if you see him can you tell him to just, I don't know, check in.",1
LORELAI,"Yes, will do.",1
RACHELorelai,Thanks.,1
LORELAI,Thanks.,1
RACHELorelai,Bye.,1
LORELAI,,1
LORELAI,Hello?,1
LORELAI,Hold it right there! Oh! Oh!,1
LUKE,It's only me!,1
LORELAI,You scared me half to death!,1
LUKE,Who'd you think it was?,1
LORELAI,"Well, I don't know! I heard some thudding upstairs and Rory weighs like ten ounces, and it either had to be an escaped elephant, or some strange large man who should not be in the house. How did you get in here anyway?",1
LUKE,Through the back door.,1
LORELAI,The back door's locked.,1
LUKE,"No, that's why I came, the back door lock was broken.",1
LORELAI,The back door lock was fine.,1
LUKE,The back door lock was cheap.,1
LORELAI,The back door lock came w ith the house. It's been a very fine back door lock.,1
LUKE,It's the kind of lock burglars look for.,1
LORELAI,Why do burglars look for that lock?,1
LUKE,Because it's easy to break into. I proved that.,1
LORELAI,You proved that by . . .?,1
LUKE,Breaking in through the back door.,1
LORELAI,Oh my God!,1
LUKE,It's the only way I could get in.,1
LORELAI,You have crossed over into the dark side Luke.,1
LUKE,It's not that big a deal.,1
LORELAI,UH! You broke into my house!,1
LUKE,I'm gonna fix it!,1
LORELAI,Ugh! Step away from that lock.,1
LUKE,What?,1
LORELAI,"Get off. Come. Sit down. You have almost no free time w ith all your work at the diner, and lately every spare moment has been spent not with Rachel.",1
LUKE,That's not true.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, she was looking for you today and she didn't know where you were.",1
LUKE,I'm not hiding from her.,1
LORELAI,I didn't say you were hiding from her.,1
LUKE,Sounded like you were implying it.,1
LORELAI,Well someone's sensitive about the accusation.,1
LUKE,I think I'm hiding from her.,1
LORELAI,I think you are too.,1
LUKE,It's just a little weird having her in my place.,1
LORELAI,I thought that's what you wanted.,1
LUKE,It was. Is. I'm just. . I've just been living alone since forever. And I just got use to putting the milk someplace in the fridge and finding it in the exact same spot. You know what I mean?,1
LORELAI,"Oh, we don't even keep milk in the house.",1
LUKE,"Well, then cookies.",1
LORELAI,Cookies almost never make it out of the car.,1
LUKE,You know what I mean.,1
LORELAI,Yeah. Well maybe you can train Rachel to use a magic marker to mark the milk exactly where you left it.,1
LUKE,It's not just about milk. I'm not used to someone expecting me.,1
LORELAI,Expecting you to. . .,1
LUKE,"Come home, do things, be with her.",1
LORELAI,"Aw, most people would k*ll to have that in their lives.",1
LUKE,"I know, but I'm different, I'm a loner.",1
LORELAI,Oh no. No no. I don't want to hear about the romance of being a loner.,1
LUKE,Some guys are just naturally loners.,1
LORELAI,"Yes, lonely guys.",1
LUKE,Independent guys.,1
LORELAI,Sad guys.,1
LUKE,Maverick guys.,1
LORELAI,Lee Harvey Oswald.,1
LUKE,John Muir.,1
LORELAI,The unabomber.,1
LUKE,Henry David Thoreau,1
LORELAI,Every one of these sad and lonely guys.,1
LUKE,"It just not what I thought it would be like having Rachel back. You know, it's not the fantasy I was toting around all these years.",1
LORELAI,"Well, Luke, life is not a fantasy. Maybe you have to lower your expectation bar a little bit.",1
LUKE,So you're saying that life is just settling for whatever comes along?,1
LORELAI,"Wow, you think having Rachel is settling?",1
LUKE,"No, I didn't mean that. Rachel's great.",1
LORELAI,"And she's crazy about you. And if her worst trait is she's a milk whore, you have it pretty good.",1
LUKE,Yeah.,1
LORELAI,And you just need to give this situation a fair chance.,1
LUKE,I know.,1
LORELAI,And that starts with ceasing work on the Winchester mystery house here.,1
Luke,Okay. Thanks.,1
LORELAI,,1
CLARA,Hi.,1
RORY,"Oh, hi. How are you today?",1
CLARA,Fine.,1
RORY,"Good, good.",1
CLARA,Are you here to see my brother?,1
RORY,"Oh, no. No. Not at all. I'm, um, with . . the Girl Scouts.",1
CLARA,I'm gonna be a Girl Scout someday. I'm a brownie now.,1
RORY,"Oh, well good, that's an excellent stepping stone.",1
CLARA,Where's your uniform?,1
RORY,"Oh we're not doing uniforms anymore. You know, we're trying to blend in, relate better to the average person. It was a very successful strategy for the Hari Krishnas, so. . .",1
CLARA,You look like someone.,1
RORY,I do?,1
CLARA,You're the girl in the pictures.,1
RORY,What pictures?,1
CLARA,The ones Dean has in his room.,1
RORY,Dean has pictures in his room?,1
CLARA,There's a funny one of you sticking out your tongue. He had a lot.,1
RORY,"Wait, wait, has or had?",1
CLARA,What?,1
RORY,"You went from has to had, that's a big difference.",1
CLARA,It is?,1
RORY,Yeah. What's your name?,1
CLARA,Clara.,1
RORY,"You're a pretty girl, Clara.",1
CLARA,Thanks.,1
RORY,Now was it has or had?,1
CLARA,I don't know.,1
RORY,You do know Clara. Had is past tense. Has is present. Now think.,1
CLARA,I'm trying.,1
RORY,Can you go to his room now?,1
CLARA,He doesn't like me in his room.,1
RORY,"Sneak in, he'll never no.",1
RORY,"Oh, no no no, Clara, don't cry. Oh, I didn't mean to make you cry. I'm a nice person. I'm a Girl Scout.",1
DEAN,Clara?,1
RORY,Bye!,1
DEAN,What's the matter?,1
CLARA,She sacred me.,1
DEAN,Who?,1
CLARA,,1
MAX,"Okay, we've got food, drink, reading material, chocolate covered espresso beans. Have I left anything out?",1
RORY,I think that about covers it.,1
LORELAI,You're such a good provider.,1
MAX,I try my best.,1
LORELAI,Are you sure you wanna go to this thing?,1
MAX,You've been talking about these town meetings for months. I've got to see one for myself.,1
LORELAI,"Well, they're never dull.",1
RORY,"And if you're lucky, you'll see some crazy lady throwing French fries at the people she disagrees with like last time.",1
MAX,So were they cold?,1
LORELAI,"No, I was just full.",1
Max,"Ah. Oh, oh, I forgot. One for you and one for you.",1
RORY,What are these?,1
MAX,Those are rings. And the diamond is actually candy so you can eat it.,1
LORELAI,"Max, that's very sweet, but we're not eight.",1
LORELAI,What do you got?,1
RORY,Grape. Yours?,1
LORELAI,Red,1
RORY,Trade you!,1
LORELAI,,1
TAYLORory,"Enough, enough of this arguing. Its time to put this to a vote. All right now, let's see a show of hands. All those in favor. . . .",1
LORELAI,Oh rats. It started already.,1
TAYLORory,"All those opposed. Lorelai, you don't even know what were voting on.",1
LORELAI,"Yeah, but I'm a-gin it!",1
TAYLORory,"All right, the nays have it. Let the record reflect it. Lorelai, I hope that's not food in those bags. Food is not allowed at town meet ings.",1
LORELAI,"No, Taylor its not. Its, um, diapers for the little ones.",1
TAYLORory,What?,1
LORELAI,Dorsal fins and cucamonga.,1
TAYLORory,What did she say LORELAI : I confuse him till he loses his train of thought and then he moves on. Hot dog?,1
TAYLORory,"All right, I'd like to open the meeting up for miscellaneous issues.",1
TROUBADOURory,I have an issue.,1
TAYLORory,Who are you?,1
TROUBADOURory,The town troubadour.,1
TAYLORory,The what?,1
BABETTE,"You've seen him Taylor, with his guitar.",1
TAYLORory,,1
PATTY,"Yes, he plays on all the street corners.",1
LUKE,He loiters on street corners.,1
TAYLORory,We're two peas in a pod Luke.,1
LUKE,Scary thought Taylor.,1
BABETTE,Go on honey.,1
TROUBADOURory,"Thank you. I've been the town troubadour for six months now, and I think I've done a pretty good job and then, he shows up . TROUBADOUR 2: Hey. TROUBADOUR 1: And there's no room for a second troubadour in Stars Hollow.",1
MOREY,Clearly.,1
TAYLORory,This is hands down the silliest thing I have ever heard.,1
LORELAI,Hear them out Taylor. It can't hurt. These are not fries. They are farfignugen sugen dugen.,1
TAYLORory,I opened the floor for issues of substance. This does not qualify.,1
MOREY,Note beyond cool Taylor. Music is substance.,1
TAYLORory,"Watch out Morey. After that anatomically explicit epithet your wife yelled at me earlier, you're both on probation. TROUBADOUR 1: All I'm asking is that the town troubadour laws be enforced.",1
TAYLORory,,1
PATTY,There ought to be something.,1
KIRK,I've got the town handbook right here.,1
TAYLORory,"I don't get this people. This man is practically a vagrant. I mean, where do you even live? What do you do for a living? TROUBADOUR 1: I don't want people to know those things!",1
TAYLORory,Why not? TROUBADOUR 1: Because that's part of being a troubadour.,1
TAYLORory,What is part of being a troubadour? TROUBADOUR 1: The mystique!,1
TAYLORory,"Oh, this is absolutely ridiculous. Do you subscribe to this troubadour mystique? TROUBADOUR 2: I run a Kinko's in Groton. TROUBADOUR 1: You see, that proves it. He doesn't respect the code. You're not supposed to talk. You're not supposed to run a Kinko's. You're supposed to speak through your music. That's the whole point.",1
TAYLORory,What is your scam buddy? TROUBADOUR 1: My scam?,1
TAYLORory,,1
PATTY,"No Taylor, he doesn't accept money. I know, I tried.",1
TAYLORory,"He may not now, but he will. This troubadour act is a money making scheme. Why else would he be doing it?",1
RORY,"Because sometimes you have something you need to say but you can't because the words won't come out or you get scared or you feel stupid, so if you could write a song and sing it then you could say what you need to say and it would be beautiful and people would listen and you wouldn't make a complete idiot out of yourself, but all of us can't be songwriters so some of us will never be able to say what we're thinking or what we want other people to know that we're thinking so we'll never get the chance to make things right again ever. So give this guy a license.",1
LORELAI,"Well, I liked that little speech. CLARA : That's the Girl Scout.",1
TAYLORory,"In the interest of not talking about this subject for another second, I hereby designate 'Mystique Guy' over here the official town troubadour. And no other troubadour may usurp his territory, meaning this other guy.",1
LORELAI,Do you want some fries? We have extra.,1
LUKE,"Nah, Rachel's minding the store so I should probably get going.",1
LORELAI,"Yeah, I agree.",1
LUKE,,1
RACHELorelai,"Oh, you're back.",1
LUKE,"Yeah, nothing much pressing at the town meeting.",1
RACHELorelai,"Okay. Well, the bread shipment's all put away, and I sent Ceasar home since it was pretty dead.",1
LUKE,Good. Good call.,1
RACHELorelai,Thanks.,1
LUKE,So you're leaving huh?,1
RACHELorelai,Yeah.,1
LUKE,Were you even gonna tell me?,1
RACHELorelai,I was waiting for you to get back so I could say goodbye.,1
LUKE,"Yeah, you at least always do that. So go.",1
RACHELorelai,Don't you even want to know why?,1
LUKE,I know why.,1
RACHELorelai,I don't think you do.,1
LUKE,"It's just like all the other times Rachel. You're the anywhere but here girl, you're restless, you're bored, it is what it is.",1
RACHELorelai,That's not it.,1
LUKE,Then what is it? Is there another guy?,1
RACHELorelai,No.,1
LUKE,Then what?,1
RACHELorelai,It's another girl.,1
LUKE,What? You telling me you're. . .,1
RACHELorelai,"The other girl isn't for me Luke, it's for you.",1
LUKE,Okay. Now that's crazy.,1
RACHELorelai,Yeah?,1
LUKE,Yeah.,1
RACHELorelai,No.,1
LUKE,"You feel you need a different excuse this time to mix things up a little, fine. But you are not leaving because of me.",1
RACHELorelai,"I'm sure you tried Luke. But admit it, you're heart wasn't in it.",1
LUKE,"My heart was in it. I was here, I didn't leave. . . .I don't get this.",1
RACHELorelai,Luke.,1
LUKE,"And what are you talking about, another girl. What other girl? Oh Rachel, no, you don't mean. . . She and I are just friends. I told you that a thousand times.",1
RACHELorelai,No. You told it to me once. And you could barely get it out then.,1
LUKE,"Okay, this is crazy. You've got it wrong here. It's not. . .She and I are. . .uh. . .",1
RACHELorelai,I'm gonna go. I'll miss you Stay in touch.,1
LUKE,"Rachel, come on.",1
RACHELorelai,So don't wait too long okay.,1
LUKE,To what?,1
RACHELorelai,,1
RORY,Hey Madeline. I've got the notes you wanted.,1
MADELINE,No thanks.,1
RORY,No these are the ones you asked for. The biology notes from Tuesday. The other day you said you. . .,1
MADELINE,No thanks.,1
RORY,But. . What's wrong with her?,1
LOUISE,Nothing's wrong with her Mary.,1
RORY,"Mary? Oh no, not this Virgin Mary thing again.",1
LOUISE,Not virgin. Typhoid.,1
RORY,What?,1
PARIS,"You know, when we met at the beginning of the year, I didn't like you because I thought you were some rube from the sticks and I have no patience for rubes.",1
RORY,How very enlightening.,1
PARIS,But then I discovered that you're not so dumb. You even seemed modestly interesting at times. That's when I made a very big mistake. I let my guard down. That won't happen again.,1
RORY,What is all this about?,1
PARIS,It's about using people for your own sick ends. It's about making enemies where you should have made friends.,1
RORY,How did I make you my enemy?,1
PARIS,Oh I think you know.,1
RORY,What? Was it setting you up with Tristin? I'm sorry about that. I thought I was just being nice.,1
PARIS,Oh sure you did.,1
RORY,"I helped you get ready. I loaned you my mother's clothes, which I still haven't gotten back by the way.",1
PARIS,"Oh my God, you're right. I hope those weren't the ones Skippy had her puppies on. I'll check when I get home.",1
RORY,Tell me w hat I did. Paris!,1
PARIS,Think about it at PJ Harvey.,1
RORY,Is that what this is about? I'm not going to PJ Harvey.,1
PARIS,Tristin says you are.,1
RORY,"Well, then he lied.",1
PARIS,I saw the tickets.,1
RORY,He bought those tickets on his own.,1
PARIS,"Look, I'm over Tristin so don't back out on my account.",1
RORY,There's nothing to back out of.,1
PARIS,"I don't have time for things like concerts anyway. I'm already lining up my extracurriculars for next year. By the way, are you still going out for the school paper?",1
RORY,You know I am.,1
PARIS,You're going to need a faculty recommendation.,1
RORY,I think I can swing it.,1
PARIS,And the support of the student editor.,1
RORY,I'm not worried.,1
PARIS,Worry. I just got the job.,1
RORY,Oh. Congratulations.,1
PARIS,"Thank you. And don't worry, you'll have some role. How's covering the new parking lot landscaping sound?",1
RORY,Peachy.,1
PARIS,"Too bad I already filled the spot for music coverage. You know, record reviewing and such. You'd have been perfect for it. I gave the job to Louise.",1
RORY,Louise owns two CDs.,1
PARIS,,1
LORELAI,"You're annoyingly on time ag ain! Ugh. Okay, stairs then shoes, stairs then shoes. Oh hi.",1
LUKE,Hey. You're all dressed up.,1
LORELAI,"Oh, I'm going out.",1
LUKE,Oh sorry. I forgot my toolbox so I just thought I'd come pick it up.,1
LORELAI,"Oh yeah. It's right over here. Rory and I couldn't lift it or we would've brought it to you and then we got used to having it here, so we named it Bert and we'd say Goodnight Bert and it'd say Goodnight girls and we spend too much time home alone.",1
LUKE,"Well, thanks for taking care of it.",1
LORELAI,Our pleasure.,1
LUKE,So Rachel left.,1
LORELAI,What!,1
LUKE,Last night. She left. For good.,1
LORELAI,"Oh no, Luke I'm so sorry. What happened?",1
LUKE,"Ah, it's hard to explain.",1
LORELAI,I can't believe it. I thought she was really in it for the long haul this time.,1
LUKE,"Yeah well, she had her reasons.",1
LORELAI,Really? What?,1
MAX,Hello? I'd tried to be late.,1
LORELAI,Oh and an utter failure at one minute past.,1
LORELAI,"Um, so uh, Max Medina this is Luke Danes. Luke owns the diner. He has the greatest coffee.",1
MAX,Oh right. I saw you at the town meeting,1
LUKE,Yeah I saw you too.,1
MAX,Nice to meet you.,1
LUKE,Uh huh.,1
MAX,"Mm hmm. So, we should be going.",1
LORELAI,Oh yeah.,1
LUKE,"Yeah, I 'm gonna get going. I just left my toolbox from when I was here earlier fixing things. I do a lot of little things around here for Lorelai.",1
LORELAI,"Yeah, you're very handy. So Luke, we'll talk later.",1
LUKE,Yes we will.,1
MAX,Although probably not tonight. We won't be back until late.,1
LORELAI,"No, I meant not tonight.",1
MAX,"Oh, I misunderstood.",1
LORELAI,I meant tomorrow. So tomorrow.,1
LUKE,Absolutely. We see each other most everyday.,1
MAX,"Well sure, you've got the coffee.",1
LUKE,And she needs the coffee. So I'll see you tomorrow.,1
LORELAI,Tomorrow.,1
LUKE,Same time as always.,1
MAX,I'd count on a little later.,1
LUKE,Doesn't matter what time it is. I'll always be around.,1
LORELAI,Bye.,1
MAX,So are we going?,1
LORELAI,"Uh, yeah. Just wanted to make sure you two were through swinging those things around. Someone's bound to lose an eye.",1
MAX,What are you talking about?,1
LORELAI,Nothing. I'll get my purse.,1
MAX,"So not to be blunt, but is that over?",1
LORELAI,Is what over?,1
MAX,Whatever's going on that I just walked in on.,1
LORELAI,"Oh Max, come on, that's Luke.",1
MAX,I kind of picked something up there.,1
LORELAI,"Okay. Well, drop it back on the ground and kick it under the couch, because there is no there there.",1
MAX,"Hey, it's okay. I mean, we were apart for quite a while. I never assumed you joined a convent.",1
LORELAI,Max.,1
MAX,"I mean, it's not like I didn't date while we were apart.",1
LORELAI,You dated?,1
MAX,A little.,1
LORELAI,A little person?,1
MAX,"No, I dated a little.",1
LORELAI,"Okay. Well, I didn't expect you to join a manvent or whatever the male equivalent of that is called. Who did you date?",1
MAX,A monastery.,1
LORELAI,You dated a monastery?,1
MAX,"No, a monastery is the male equivalent of a convent.",1
LORELAI,Thank you Mr. Medina. I'll make a note for the quiz on Friday.,1
MAX,I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.,1
LORELAI,"No, I get it. Yes. We were apart. And, uh, you know, I didn't exactly remain inactive.",1
MAX,So you did date Luke?,1
LORELAI,"No, I did not date Luke.",1
MAX,You can tell me.,1
LORELAI,I did not date Luke.,1
MAX,There was a vibe.,1
LORELAI,There was no vibe. What is with the questioning? You won't tell me who you dated.,1
MAX,There's no one you know.,1
LORELAI,"Okay, well, did you date like casual nothing type dating or did you date like get down, soul train kind of a dating?",1
MAX,"Well, I wouldn't have phrased it that way, but to be honest, it was the latter.",1
LORELAI,"Good, good. Okay. Well, I like your honesty. Because I mean you could've lied and left that part out to spare my feelings which would've been unnecessary. So thank you, that was good. I slept with Rory's dad.",1
MAX,Let's change the subject.,1
LORELAI,On my parents' balcony.,1
MAX,I want to change the subject.,1
LORELAI,"Okay, well you started it.",1
MAX,I did not mean for this to become a who slept with whom contest.,1
LORELAI,"Well, how did it get that way?",1
MAX,I don't know. Why do we do this? Why do we let it get weird between us just when it's getting good again?,1
LORELAI,I don't know.,1
MAX,I don't like it.,1
LORELAI,I don't either.,1
MAX,And I'm sick of it.,1
LORELAI,"Well, so am I.",1
MAX,We can't keep getting this close just to have something completely derail us again. And frankly there's only one thing I can think of that could solve it.,1
LORELAI,Break up.,1
MAX,Ugh.,1
LORELAI,"Well, I'm not interested in a m*rder-su1c1de kind of thing. .",1
MAX,We should get married.,1
LORELAI,Give me a c lue as to whether you're kidding or not.,1
MAX,I am not kidding.,1
LORELAI,Good clue.,1
MAX,What do you say?,1
LORELAI,"Nothing. Max, you did not just propose to me.",1
MAX,Yes I did.,1
LORELAI,No. A proposal had to be something more than the desperate desire to end a bickering match.,1
MAX,It was more than that.,1
LORELAI,"No, it has to be planned. It should be magical. There should be music playing and romantic lighting and a subtle buildup to the popping of the big question. There should be a thousand yellow daisies and candles and a horse and I don't know what the horse is doing there unless you're riding it, which seems a little over the top, but it should be more than this.",1
MAX,You're right.,1
LORELAI,I am right.,1
MAX,I'm sorry.,1
LORELAI,It's okay.,1
MAX,Let's start the evening over.,1
LORELAI,Ding dong.,1
MAX,"Oh, now I'm five minutes late.",1
LORELAI,"Well, you're making good progress.",1
MAX,Let's go?,1
LORELAI,,1
TRISTIN,So I'm a little tired of this game.,1
RORY,What game?,1
TRISTIN,Are we meet ing there or what?,1
RORY,What are you talking about?,1
TRISTIN,The concert's tonight.,1
RORY,Well I hope you and the empty seat next to you have a lot of fun.,1
TRISTIN,I'm started to get a little irritated here.,1
RORY,So am I.,1
TRISTIN,What are you mad about?,1
RORY,You've been telling everyone that I'm going to this thing with you.,1
TRISTIN,Just a couple.,1
RORY,You told Paris. Paris and I had just started getting along and now she hates me again.,1
TRISTIN,"Well, the damage is done. You might as well go to PJ Harvey with me.",1
RORY,Never never. I am never going anywhere with you ever.,1
TRISTIN,"You know, these tickets cost me a fortune.",1
RORY,They cost your daddy a fortune.,1
TRISTIN,I don't even know anybody else who's even into this stupid guy.,1
RORY,PJ Harvey's a woman.,1
RORY,What are you doing?,1
TRISTIN,You'll get them back when you agree to go with me.,1
RORY,You're pathetic Tristin. Keep the books. I'm leaving. Dean? Dean. What are you doing here?,1
DEAN,I'm leaving.,1
RORY,Don't go.,1
DEAN,I shouldn't have come.,1
RORY,No wait.,1
DEAN,I feel like an idiot.,1
RORY,Why?,1
DEAN,'Cause I come al l the way out here and I see you with him. That's just great.,1
RORY,"No, Tristin was just . . .",1
DEAN,I don't care.,1
RORY,No listen.,1
DEAN,He's got your books Rory.,1
RORY,But he took them and wouldn't give them back. Please just tell me why you're here.,1
DEAN,I don't even know.,1
RORY,Yes you do.,1
DEAN,'Cause I thought you . . Forget it.,1
RORY,No say it.,1
DEAN,I thought you were trying to talk to me.,1
RORY,Oh.,1
DEAN,"I mean, you came to my house.",1
RORY,That wasn't me.,1
DEAN,It was you.,1
RORY,It must've been someone that looked like me.,1
DEAN,My sister recognized you from the pictures in my box.,1
RORY,In what box?,1
DEAN,The box of stuff I have of us. Pictures and letters and everything from you.,1
RORY,You have a Rory box?,1
DEAN,"And what was going on at the town meeting, all that stuff about writing a song?",1
RORY,I don't know what I was talking about.,1
DEAN,That had nothing to do with me? Well I must have imagined it all then. Your boyfriend's waiting.,1
RORY,He's not my boyfriend. I hate him.,1
DEAN,Whatever.,1
RORY,Dean.,1
DEAN,What.,1
RORY,Stop.,1
DEAN,Why.,1
RORY,,1
MICHELorelai,"Do you understand what I'm trying to explain to you? Do you speak English? Are you listening to me? Ah, what took you?",1
LORELAI,"Sorry, I got here as quickly as I could. Hi Kirk.",1
MICHELorelai,Do not address him. He's a scoundrel.,1
KIRK,I'm just doing my job.,1
LORELAI,What's going on?,1
MICHELorelai,Am I or am I not the head man in charge of floral deliveries?,1
LORELAI,"Yes, and one of the few men I know who would proudly declare that fact.",1
KIRK,I'm just doing my job.,1
MICHELorelai,Stop saying that.,1
LORELAI,This has to do with flowers we ordered?,1
MICHELorelai,Flowers we did not order.,1
KIRK,I'm just doing my job.,1
MICHELorelai,Say that one more time an d I'm going to punch your nose.,1
LORELAI,It must be a mistake.,1
KIRK,There's no mistake.,1
MICHELorelai,I did not order these flowers.,1
KIRK,It says that you have to be here to personally accept them.,1
LORELAI,That I have to be here? Well that's. . . .,1
MICHELorelai,I am head man in charge of flowers.,1
KIRK,I just do what I'm told.,1
MICHELorelai,,1
KIRK,That's not what I was saying before.,1
MICHELorelai,It is a little variation that will still lead to a punch on the nose.,1
MICHELorelai,"Daisies no less. As if I would order these pitiful little things. Foul things, these daisies. And just a notch up from weeds. And look how many. I mean, there must be at least. . .",1
LORELAI,A thousand of them. A thousand yellow daisies.,1
KIRK,"That's right. There's exactly a thousand of them. The order states that there is to be exactly 1000. Not 1001, not 999, but 1000. You ask for 1000, I bring 1000. I don't question the orders. I merely fill them.",1
MICHELorelai,"Job well done, Mr. Adolph Eichmann.",1
MAX,I couldn't find a horse.,1
LORELAI,You didn't have to.,1
MAX,"Don't say anything, okay, please. You were right last night. I shouldn't have proposed to you like that. It was stupid. It was the wrong place, and the wrong time, and I kicked myself the entire night for doing it. But you were wrong about something too. I didn't propose to you because we were fighting. I proposed because I love you. We're in a bad pattern Lorelai and we have to break it. And other than that m*rder su1c1de thing you were talking about, which would be illegal and messy, I can only think to be impetuous.",1
LORELAI,Max.,1
MAX,"No, listen, I woke up this morning and I realized that I have studied and talked a great literature all my life and those stories are replete with characters that let opportunities slip by. But what I teach is more than just literature, its lessons in life. And if I don't follow the tenets of those lessons, I'm not the man I thought I was. The man I want to be.",1
LORELAI,"God, you talk so good.",1
MAX,I don't want an answer now. I've thought about this. I want you to do the same. I love you Lorelai Gilmore. And I know this to be true. I'll talk to you later.,1
LORELAI,,1
LORELAI,Rory!,1
LUKE,"Geesh, you made me spill.",1
LORELAI,"Sorry! Uh, she's not here?",1
LUKE,"No, what's the matter?",1
LORELAI,"I sent her a message to meet me here at 7 and she's supposed to meet me here at 7, so what time is it?",1
LUKE,Seven.,1
KIRK,I'm damp.,1
LORELAI,Where is she?,1
LUKE,"Calm down, is everything okay?",1
LORELAI,"Yes, maybe, I think so. I don't know.",1
LUKE,So what's going on?,1
LORELAI,Big things. Big potentially life-changing things.,1
LUKE,You get a promotion?,1
LORELAI,"Oh yeah, they made me head salesman of the Northwest Territories. No I run an inn, there's no place to promote me too.",1
LUKE,So it's nothing to do with work?,1
LORELAI,Where is she?,1
LUKE,Have some coffee while you wait.,1
LORELAI,"No, I couldn't take coffee, big hole, through the roof, very bad.",1
LUKE,You're saying no to coffee. This is big. Can't tell me what it is?,1
LORELAI,I just really need to tell Rory first.,1
LUKE,But you're happy about this news.,1
LORELAI,"I might be. Maybe. It's just kind of a, wow I can't believe this is happening to me kind of a mindblowing moment. . Oh there she is! I'm gonna go The whole town gets one today.",1

LORELAI,"All the way from home, same topic. There's tons of stuff going on in the world. Big stuff.",2
RORY,Like?,2
LORELAI,Balkans.,2
RORY,That was ages ago. Read a paper.,2
LORELAI,Ugh. They make my hands black.,2
RORY,Oh! You should walk down the aisle to Frank Sinatra with a huge bouquet of something that smells really good.,2
LORELAI,Pot Roast.,2
RORY,And you should wear a long veil with your hair up.,2
LORELAI,"Ugh, I'll take any other subject in the world for two hundred Alex.",2
RORY,Why don't you want to think about this?,2
LORELAI,"Because I haven't made my mind up about the yes or no part, so I don't want to start fantasizing about dresses and flowers or doves and tulle until I do, so please change the subject.",2
RORY,I think the bridesmaids should be able to pick their own dresses.,2
LORELAI,You know how on All in the Family when Edith would be yapping about something and Archie would pretend to make a noose and hang himself or sh**t himself in the head?,2
RORY,Yeah?,2
LORELAI,I don't know. Something about this moment just made me think of that.,2

LANE,"No, I'm not okay.",2
RORY,What's wrong? Did she find your CD burner?,2
LANE,My mother and father are sending me to Korea for the summer to visit my cousins.,2
RORY,So?,2
LANE,They're sending me to Korea and they won't tell me when I'm coming back.,2
RORY,What do you mean they won't tell you when you're coming back?,2
LANE,"I mean, they bought me a o ne way ticket. One way! The plane goes there and stops!",2
RORY,Are you sure?,2
LANE,"I called the airline to confirm it, and my parents were in their room whispering all morning. And when my mother came out, she looked very happy. She was hummin g. I swear, they're planningto send me Korea for the rest of my life.",2
RORY,"Lane, come on.",2
LANE,"It's gonna be just like that Sally Field movie when her husband took them to Iran and wouldn't let them come back, except that I won't have to keep my head covered.",2

LORELAI,What is with this place? Why will nobody believe me?,2
RORY,They believe you.,2
LORELAI,No they don't.,2
RORY,I promise they believe you.,2
LORELAI,You are pacifying me.,2
RORY,Just a little.,2
LORELAI,"Well, I don't like it",2
RORY,I'll see if I can stop.,2
LORELAI,I can't wait for the movie theater to reopen.,2
LORELAI,"Hmm. Let's see, what looks good. I'm so unbelievably hungry I'm gonna have to order breakfast and lunch, crazy huh?",2
RORY,"Mom, go tell him.",2
LORELAI,I will.,2
RORY,Now.,2
LORELAI,Why?,2
RORY,Because in five minutes somebody's about to be pushed through that window.,2
LORELAI,This is crazy. Why is everybody making such a big deal about this?,2
RORY,Because everyone knows that Luke has a thing for you.,2
LORELAI,Luke does not have a thing for me.,2
RORY,Tell him.,2
LORELAI,"Uh, we can barely get through a single conversation without biting each other's heads off.",2
RORY,Tell him.,2
LORELAI,"Everything about me repulses that man. My coffee drinking, my eating habits. Remember when I called him Ran ger Bob last week, he hated that!",2
RORY,Will you get me a mu ffin when you're up there?,2
LORELAI,Okay. God. Fine. Hey.,2
LUKE,Fresh coffee will be ready in a minute unless you wanna just roll up a dollar bill and go nuts.,2
LORELAI,"No thanks, I can wait.",2
LUKE,What the hell's going on with them?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, I don't know.",2
LUKE,Crazy people. Whole town should be medicated and put in a rec room with ping pong tables and hand puppets. What?,2
LORELAI,"Nothing. I. . . well, I have something to tell you. No I have something to share with you actually.",2
LUKE,To share with me.,2
LORELAI,"Yes, 'cause when exciting things happen in your life, you want to share them with the people in your life who you think will find them exciting, which I think you will.",2
LUKE,What is it?,2
LORELAI,"Well, it's very. . .",2
LUKE,"Exciting, I've heard. I'm all prepared to jump up and down if necessary.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, here it is. Um, Max has asked me to marry him.",2
LUKE,"Yeah, I figured.",2
LORELAI,You did?,2
LUKE,"Well, it was obvious. You know, you too were getting kind of close. He was around a lot. Then last night with that life changing thing comment, you know, I put two and two together and figured it out.",2
LORELAI,Oh.,2
LUKE,Congratulations by the way.,2
LORELAI,Thank you.,2
LUKE,You set a date?,2
LORELAI,"No, I haven't answered him yet.",2
LUKE,You're gonna say yes.,2
LORELAI,How do you know?,2
LUKE,"Well, you're making a big deal about telling me he proposed.",2
LORELAI,"Uh, I don't think I'm mak ing a big deal.",2
LUKE,And you wouldn't do that if you weren't gonna say yes.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, I'm sharing something with you. Sharing is not making a big deal, sharing is a nice gesture. Like when you're a kid and you have one of those popsicles and you break it in two and offer half to another kid. That is sharing, that is what I'm doing.",2
LUKE,You offered me half a popsicle?,2
LORELAI,"Yes. Okay, so now you know.",2
LUKE,Now I know.,2
LORELAI,"Uh, I guess I'll just have two blueberry muffins and some coffee.",2
LUKE,Coming right up.,2
LORELAI,Okay.,2
LUKE,"You know, I think it's good you're doing this.",2
LORELAI,"You do? Good, me too. I mean, not that I'm definitely doing it, but if I do, then it'll be good.",2
LUKE,Where you gonna live?,2
LORELAI,What?,2
LUKE,Here? Hartford?,2
LORELAI,"Here. I don't know, we haven't talked about it actually.",2
LUKE,"Hartford's probably good, closer to Rory's school.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, I guess.",2
LUKE,"Of course, it is a little far from the inn.",2
LORELAI,"Uh, yeah.",2
LUKE,But who knows how long you'll work after you're married.,2
LORELAI,Excuse me?,2
LUKE,"Oh, but you probably already talked about that, right?",2
LORELAI,"Uh, no, but I do think he and my father have come to an agreement on how many goats I'm worth.",2
LUKE,"Hey, I'm just talking here. It's great, really. You gonna have more kids?",2
LORELAI,"Hi, personal.",2
LUKE,"I mean, he wants kids right?",2
LORELAI,"In the world? Yes, he wants kids.",2
LUKE,You haven't talked about that either.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, you know, what we have and have not discussed is none of your business.",2
LUKE,Joint checking accounts?,2
LORELAI,Luke!,2
LUKE,You do know his last name don't you?,2
LORELAI,I want my popsicle back.,2
LUKE,"Fine, it's your business.",2
ORELAI,Yes it is. It's my business.,2
LUKE,"Hey, some people go their entire lives without having these kinds of conversations. My parents didn't discuss a damn thing my entire childhood. Worked fine for them. Of course, when my mom died she had to tell my dad where the coupon drawer was. Took him ten years to find it. Used a coffee can the whole time.",2
LORELAI,Okay.,2
LUKE,"I don't care what anybody says, a coupon can is not as good as a coupon drawer.",2
LORELAI,How are those muffins coming?,2
LUKE,"But you know what, you might like a coupon can. You never know. Here you go. Two blueberry muffins.",2
LORELAI,Thank you.,2
LUKE,And congratulations again.,2
LORELAI,Now what's going on?,2
RORY,Kirk passed out.,2
LORELAI,Here's your muffin.,2
RORY,Thanks. How'd he take it?,2
LORELAI,"Fine, he took it fine.",2
RORY,Are you okay?,2
LORELAI,"Fine, I'm just tied to the emergency break.",2
RORY,How did you do that?,2
LORELAI,"With a flourish and a big ending. Okay, I got it. Let's go. Oh, my coat.",2
RORY,It's pretty warm out for a coat.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, well, it tends to cool off the minute I get in that house.",2
RORY,You good?,2
LORELAI,I'm good. My keys.,2
RORY,Mom.,2
LORELAI,"They're in the ignition. Okay, I got 'em. Let's go.",2
RORY,What is wrong with you?,2
LORELAI,Nothing.,2
RORY,You got lost coming here.,2
LORELAI,I took a wrong turn.,2
RORY,Six times.,2
LORELAI,"Well, my self preservational instincts at work ladies and gentlemen.",2
RORY,And then the coat and the keys and the . . .,2
LORELAI,I got stuff on my mind.,2
RORY,Max stuff?,2
LORELAI,"No, stuff stuff.",2
RORY,You're lying.,2
LORELAI,I'm being mysterious. That's what women do.,2
RORY,Mom.,2
LORELAI,"Oh look, doorbell. Pretty sound.",2
RORY,"You know, you always make me tell you what I'm thinking.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, and the lesson we have learned from that is you should never become a spy.",2
EMILY,"You're here. Richard, they're here.",2
RICHARD,Wonderful!,2
EMILY,"Come in , come in , come in .",2
LORELAI,"Uh, no.",2
EMILY,Why?,2
LORELAI,Because you're scaring Rory.,2
EMILY,"Oh stop that. Get in here. Scaring Rory, you're so silly sometimes. Let's get you a drink. Put your coat down. Oh, and are you hungry? I had Antonia make some Roqueford puffs. Antonia, bring the puffs! Come, sit down, sit down. Richard!",2
RICHARD,Say nothing until I get there.,2

EMILY,"Well, as a matter of fact. Oh for goodness sake. Richard, dammit!",2
LORELAI,"Mom, why don't you just tell us what's happening now?",2
EMILY,"Oh, all right. I can't wait for your grandfather any longer. Well, you know I'm very good friends with Bitty Charleston, the headmaster's wife.",2
LORELAI,Mm Hmm.,2
EMILY,"Well, we had this little arrangement where she keeps me aprised of all the goings on at Chilton. You know, she tells me al l the gossip on the students and their parents, and any piece of information I might find useful. Well, this afternoon she called to tell me the class list just came out, and Rory has finished in the top three percent!",2
LORELAI,I know.,2
EMILY,"You do? Well, who do you know at Chilton?",2
LORELAI,"Um, Rory.",2
EMILY,Oh.,2
RORY,"It wasn't definite, but I had a pretty good idea.",2
RICHARD,"Rory, wonderful news. You finished in the top three percent of your class.",2
LORELAI,"Oh yeah, Dad, J. Edgar Hoover over here was just telling us.",2
RICHARD,What? I told you not to say anything before I got here.,2
EMILY,"Well, you took too long.",2
LORELAI,"No, no, we already knew.",2
RICHARD,It's a simple request.,2
EMILY,Just hang up the phone.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, good news either way. Let's all agree on that.",2
RICHARD,I am immen sely proud of you Rory.,2
EMILY,"Yes, we knew you could do it.",2
RICHARD,"Oh, we certainly did.",2
EMILY,We have to celebrate. Next week we will have a special dinner.,2
RORY,"Grandma, all of your dinners are special.",2
EMILY,"Well, this one will be extra special. We'll make all your favorite foods, and you can invite some of your friends.",2
RICHARD,There's an excellent chance that presents might be involved.,2
RORY,You guys do not have to do this.,2
RICHARD,For the top three percent?,2
EMILY,We most certainly do.,2
RICHARD,"You start late, have to catch up, and by the end of the year, you've overtaken everyone. A true Gilmore.",2
EMILY,Through and through.,2
ANTONIA,Dinner is ready.,2
EMILY,Thank you Antonia. Shall we?,2
RICHARD,"Ah ah ah ah, after the top 3 percent in her class.",2
RORY,"Well, thank you very much.",2
LORELAI,"Uh, just go ahead and Start without me. I gotta check in at the inn. Michel's there by himself, people could die.",2
EMILY,"Well, hurry up.",2
MAX,Hello?,2
LORELAI,Where are we gonna live?,2
MAX,Lorelai?,2
LORELAI,Where are we gonna live?,2
MAX,"Well, I. . .",2
LORELAI,"Your house, my house?",2
MAX,I don't know.,2
LORELAI,"I mean, we should figure this stuff out. I have a life and a kid, and both of them require a house of some sort.",2
MAX,"Okay, but. . .",2
LORELAI,"And I have stuff. I have a lot of stuff. You haven't seen my closet yet, but you would not believe the amount of stuff one person can accumulate. I don't even know what this stuff is, but it's there and it's mine and it needs a place to live.",2
MAX,Well. . .,2
LORELAI,And I want to work.,2
MAX,What?,2
LORELAI,And I like my bank.,2
MAX,Okay hold on.,2
LORELAI,It's small and the teller's name is Margie and she can't count. And I think there's something so poetic about banking at a place where the teller can't count.,2
MAX,Lorelai.,2
LORELAI,What?,2
MAX,Calm down. Talk to me.,2
LORELAI,"It's just. . . . If I die, I want you to know where the coupon drawer is.",2
MAX,"Well, I would like that too. I think.",2
LORELAI,"Well, we need to figure these things out before. . .",2
MAX,Before what? Are you saying yes?,2
LORELAI,What?,2
MAX,Are you saying yes?,2
LORELAI,Why are you asking me that?,2
MAX,"Because you call me, out of the blue, completely panicked about where we're gonna live and bank and coupon drawers and Margie.",2
LORELAI,"Well, these are important things to discuss.",2
MAX,"I agree. They're extremely important things to discuss, especially if you're saying yes. Are you?",2
EMILY,I am extremely thrilled about this. Do you think you'll get a certificate?,2
RORY,I'm not sure.,2
EMILY,"Well, they certainly should give you a certificate or a plaque or something. I'll talk to Bitty about that tomorrow.",2
RICHARD,I can't wait to tell Tellman McCabe about this.,2
EMILY,Oh Richard.,2
RICHARD,"Oh, he's always bragging about that simpleton grandson of his.",2
EMILY,William is a lovely boy.,2
RICHARD,His head is shaped like a football.,2
EMILY,It is not.,2
RICHARD,"If he fell asleep in the park, someone would try to punt him.",2
EMILY,Tellman is a very dear friend of yours.,2
RICHARD,Yes he is. And one should always share wonderful news with one's very good friends.,2
EMILY,You just want to brag.,2
RICHARD,"Well, I think I have a right, don't you?",2
EMILY,"Well goodness, you'd think you were the one who finished in the top three percent of your class.",2
RICHARD,"Well it was my genes, I get to claim a little responsibility.",2
RICHARD,Oh!,2
EMILY,Goodness.,2
RICHARD,I just spilled on my shirt. What are you doing? What are they doing Emily?,2
EMILY,I have no idea. Stop that you too!,2
LORELAI,Sorry.,2
RORY,Yeah sorry.,2
EMILY,What is going on?,2
LORELAI,"Uh, I'm just really jazzed about this whole three percent thing.",2
RORY,"Yeah, really really jazzed.",2
LORELAI,Yeah.,2
EMILY,"Don't even try to understand Richard. Antonia, please bring some club soda for Mr. Gilmore's shirt.",2
SOOKIE,"Carlito, we're running out of clarified butter. Ooh, chop that finer. No hard boiling. Yo profiero tener los huevos suave. Ooh, that looks good. Add a little pinch of oregano, I think we've got it. DELIVERY",2
MAN,"Okay, I got your lobsters.",2
SOOKIE,"Yeah? Are they good? Ooh, they look good. Yes they do. Ow! It's got my hand. It's got my hand. Thanks. Okay, I'll be fine, I'll be fine. I'm a good cotter, don't worry. You are fresh, aren't you? Okay, in the back, in the back, in the back. Michel, I'm gonna need you to move.",2
MICHELorelai,In a minute.,2
SOOKIE,What are you doing?,2
MICHELorelai,I am weighing my turkey.,2
SOOKIE,Why?,2
MICHELorelai,A group of scientists did a study on rats where they cut their daily calories by thirty percent.,2
SOOKIE,And you felt left out?,2
MICHELorelai,"No, the rats lived thirty percent longer. And the scientists were so impressed that they cut their own calories just like the rats.",2
SOOKIE,That was a very nice display of solidarity.,2
MICHELorelai,"I have decided to do the same. I figure if I stay alive long enough, these scientists, they will be able to cure anything including death, therefore ensuring my indefinite existence.",2
SOOKIE,"So you're gonna live forever, like on Fame?",2
MICHELorelai,Don't speak to me.,2
SOOKIE,Give me back my scale.,2
LORELAI,"Hey. I have an announcement to make, and it's big and it's fabulous and you are not gonna believe it.",2
MICHELorelai,Goodbye.,2
LORELAI,"Wait, I got news.",2
MICHELorelai,"Oh, well I'm sure it's very exciting. Excuse me.",2
LORELAI,But. . . What's with the turkey?,2
SOOKIE,"Oh, Michel thinks he's gonna live forever.",2
LORELAI,Like on Fame?,2
SOOKIE,That's what I said!,2
MICHELorelai,"Hmm, a hundred years from now I will sit around telling my fellow man of science about the two of you and we will giggle like little girls at your ignorance. Now I have work to do.",2
LORELAI,"He did say ""giggle like little girls"" right?",2
SOOKIE,Forget him. Tell me ab out your fabulous news.,2
LORELAI,I'm engaged.,2
SOOKIE,What?,2
LORELAI,I'm getting married.,2
SOOKIE,No!,2
LORELAI,Yes!,2
SOOKIE,No!,2
LORELAI,Yes!,2
SOOKIES,No!,2
LORELAI,Yes!,2
SOOKIE,No!,2
LORELAI,No?,2
SOOKIE,What?,2
LORELAI,Sookie!,2
SOOKIE,"God, this is amazing! Oh my God, I'm shaking! Max is a wonderful man. It is Max, right?",2
LORELAI,"Yes, it is Max.",2
SOOKIE,"Okay, good good good. Oh, I knew it. I knew you'd get engaged.",2
LORELAI,"Really? God, I didn't.",2
SOOKIE,You're gonna be a sadie.,2
LORELAI,A what?,2
SOOKIE,"A sadie. ""Sadie, sadie, married lady. Meet a mortgagee.""",2
LORELAI,Funny Girl!,2
SOOKIE,Streisand!,2
LORELAI,Love it!,2
SOOKIE,Who's catering?,2
LORELAI,"Um, Bobby Flay?",2
SOOKIE,Not funny. I'm mak ing the cake also.,2
LORELAI,Absolutely.,2
SOOKIE,"Okay, let's start a menu. Something light and romantic to start with. Something that will go wonderful with champagne. Truffles go wonderful with champagne. And scrambled eggs.",2
LORELAI,Sookie? Honey?,2
SOOKIE,"I know scrambled eggs don't sound very festive, but when you put them in a little quail's egg shell and you put cavier on top, they are quite a crowd pleaser.",2
LORELAI,"Hey, what's with the waterworks lady?",2
SOOKIE,"It's just. . .I don't know. You raised that little girl all alone, and she is so great, and you work your butt off here and you go to school and you put up with me.",2
LORELAI,"Aww, honey.",2
SOOKIE,You just really deserve this.,2
LORELAI,Thank you.,2
JACKSON,"Prepare yourself for the most gorgeous brussel sprouts ever. Sookie, are you okay? Are you hurt? Have you been making cutlets again?",2
SOOKIE,"Lorelai's getting married! Married! Uh, I love saying that! Married, married, married!",2
JACKSON,"Oh, that's great. Congratulations.",2
LORELAI,Thanks Jackson.,2
JACKSON,"Uh, hey, do you wanna look at the brussel sprouts?",2
SOOKIE,"Yes, I do. No. Ooh, what about some nice brussel sprouts with like a garlic olive oil for the wedding? That sounds like a 'til death do us part' kind of side dish, doesn't it?",2
JACKSON,"Yeah, I wouldn't know.",2
SOOKIE,"Well, what do you think is the most romantic vegetable?",2
JACKSON,"You know, I'm the wrong guy to ask.",2
SOOKIE,You're the vegetable guy.,2
JACKSON,"Yeah, but the normal vegetable guy, not the romantic vegetable guy. I mean, I would have no idea what an appropriate vegetable would be to serve at a wedding. I've never even been to a wedding. One, my cousin BonBon. Yes, that's his real name. And I didn't stay long, and I didn't notice the vegetables, so I would not be the guy to ask about wedding vegetables. I'm not the wedding vegetable guy!",2
LORELAI,"Uh oh. Jackson's got panicked ""my girlfriend wants me to get married"" face on.",2
SOOKIE,"Yup. Hey, next time he's here, tell him that you're pregnant.",2
LORELAI,With twins.,2
SOOKIE,Why not?,2
RORY,"Okay, so what's the latest?",2
LANE,I just got off the phone with the American consulate.,2
RORY,And?,2
LANE,Can you say Hyung-hyung?,2
RORY,"No, and what is that?",2
LANE,My Korean name.,2
RORY,There must be something you can do.,2
LANE,"I'm a minor. I've been put in the custody of family by my parents. That's it, it's over.",2
RORY,You have to at least try to talk to your family.,2
LANE,,2
KIM,Dinner!,2
LANE,I have to go. Last meal.,2
RORY,,2
KIM,Lanie!,2
LANE,Coming Mama!,2
LORELAI,Do you want tater tots also?,2
RORY,That's a rhetorical question right?,2
LORELAI,Okay.,2
RORY,"So, what kind of dress are you thinking of?",2
LORELAI,"Um, the one Stephanie Seymour wore in the g*ns N' Roses video.",2
RORY,What about colors? Did you pick your colors yet?,2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
RORY,Really? What?,2
LORELAI,Spumoni.,2
RORY,"Okay, I am planning this wedding without you. You will have no say and I may not even let you come.",2
LORELAI,Uh!,2
RORY,Hello?,2
MAX,"Rory, good, it's Max.",2
RORY,"Oh, hey Max.",2
MAX,"Oh look, I've been out ring shopping all day.",2
RORY,Ring shopping. Very interesting.,2
MAX,"Now I've narrowed it down to three different rings, but I want to get her something she's really gonna like, not just something that she tells me she likes but really hates, and you know her taste in jewelry better than I do, so I thought maybe you could give me some advice.",2
RORY,"Okay, well, anything with the word ""Foxy"" on it is a big crowd pleaser.",2
MAX,"Oh, maybe for our first anniversary.",2
RORY,"Okay, I'm listening.",2
MAX,"Okay. The first ring has a gold band and sort of a square diamond. It's simple, but very classic.",2
RORY,"Gold band, square diamond, simple, classic. I'm not sure that's really her.",2
MAX,"Okay, the next one is sort of an engagement band with small diamonds all around it, white gold, and there's a wedding band that sort of fits into it like a set.",2
RORY,"White gold engagement band, small diamonds around it, with wedding band that fits into it. That's a possibility. What's the third one?",2
MAX,The third one is from the twenties.,2
RORY,"From the twenties, hmm.",2
MAX,Large diamond in the middle.,2
RORY,Large diamond in the middle.,2
MAX,Diamond clusters on the sides.,2
RORY,Diamond clusters on the sides.,2
MAX,A little deco.,2
RORY,"A little deco. That sounds great. Uh, good going. She's gonna be ecstatic.",2
MAX,She's right there with you isn't she?,2
RORY,What? No.,2
MAX,"No, I thought I heard her bark.",2
RORY,"No, that's just a wild jackal that hangs out here sometimes.",2
MAX,Mm hmm. Put Cujo on the phone please.,2
RORY,One sec. Here boy.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, hello Max, what a pleasant surprise. I just walked in.",2
RORY,Hi.,2

RORY,"Nope, right on time.",2
DEAN,Good.,2
RORY,Are you coming in?,2
DEAN,"In a sec. Ah, where's your mom?",2
RORY,In the kitchen on the phone.,2
DEAN,"Beginning, middle, or end of a conversation?",2
RORY,"Well, it concerns jewelry so there may not be an end to the conversation.",2
DEAN,Good. Hi.,2
RORY,Hi.,2
DEAN,I missed that.,2
RORY,Me too.,2
DEAN,"So, uh, ya know, this whole breaking up thing, we tried it. . .",2
RORY,Yeah we did. Didn't really work for me.,2
DEAN,Me either.,2
RORY,"Okay good, so it's decided. Breaking up, not for us.",2
DEAN,"I mean, hey, not that it's a bad thing. I'm sure some people like it.",2
RORY,"Oh sure, Cher, Greg Allman, bet they'd give it a big thumbs up. Did you pick out your ring?",2
LORELAI,"Yup, he's gonna surprise me w ith it tomorrow.",2
RORY,Twenties deco?,2
LORELAI,Supposedly ripped right off of Zelda Fitzgerald's cold dead hand. Hey Dean.,2
DEAN,Hey.,2
RORY,When is dinner ready?,2
LORELAI,Do I look like a timer?,2
RORY,I thought you might have set one.,2
LORELAI,Silly rabbit.,2
RORY,Timers are for kids.,2
LORELAI,"I say 10 minutes, we're there.",2
RORY,I'll get us set up.,2
DEAN,So what's the movie for tonight?,2
LORELAI,"Oh my god, a classic.",2

RORY,su1c1de.,2
LORELAI,Not getting The Tonight Show.,2
RORY,Mean boyfriends.,2
LORELAI,Identical noses.,2
RORY,"You'll laugh, you'll cry.",2
LORELAI,Because you're laughing so hard.,2
RORY,It'll be an evening to rememb er.,2
LORELAI,"And in the pivotal scene where a very distraught Joan gets locked out of High Holiday Services because she's late, I will be forced to rewind it and play it over and over about four thousand times.",2
RORY,You'll never be the same.,2
LORELAI,So ,2
DEAN,So.,2
LORELAI,It's nice to have you back.,2
DEAN,"Thanks, it's nice to be back.",2
LORELAI,We missed you.,2

DEAN,"You need the water bottle changed, don't you?",2
LORELAI,Desperately.,2
DEAN,Rag.,2
LORELAI,Thank you.,2
RORY,Where's Dean?,2
LORELAI,Getting water.,2
RORY,You're shameless.,2
LORELAI,He offered.,2
RORY,Please.,2
LORELAI,"The first thing he said to me w as 'Hey Lorelai, can I change your water?' What can I do? The kid's a freak.",2
DEAN,Hey.,2
RORY,"Hey, I'm so sorry she's got you doing chores already.",2
DEAN,"Aw, I don't mind.",2
RORY,You will. She pulled out the mower this morning.,2
DEAN,"Well if that movie is anything like you described, mowing might be a good alternative.",2
RORY,"Hey, I wanted to ask you something.",2
DEAN,Yeah?,2
RORY,"My grandparents are having this special dinner for me next week. It's nothing big, but they said I could invite someone, and I thought, you've never seen my grandparents' house and I'd really like you to meet my Grandpa. What?",2
DEAN,"Well, ah, it's just the last time I met your Grandma was the night of the dance and you know how that turned out, so...",2
RORY,The dance was a long time ag o. She's over it by now. I'm sure everything would be fine.,2
DEAN,You want me to go?,2
RORY,"Yeah, I want you to go.",2

RICHARD,"It's rather snappy, isn't it? Oh, oh, oh.",2
EMILY,"Richard, don't you dare get on that phone. They'll be here any second.",2
RICHARD,I'm not getting on the phone. I'm going to give Rory that first edition of Mencken's Chrestomathy.,2

RORY,"Grandma, you rememb er Dean right?",2
EMILY,"Yes I do, nice to see you again.",2
DEAN,"Thanks. Uh, your house is great. It's huge. I've never seen a house this huge before.",2
EMILY,Well thank you. So few people bother to notice the hugeness of the house anymore.,2
LORELAI,"Mom, it was so nice of you to tell Rory to invite a friend tonight, seeing as this is her night. That was really nice of you.",2
EMILY,It was my pleasure.,2
LORELAI,Good.,2
EMILY,"Well, don't just stand there. We have a celebration to attend. Come in, come in.",2
EMILY,"So, what would everyone like to drink?",2
LORELAI,"Uh, well, I'll have a white wine and Dean'll have a beer.",2
DEAN,What?!,2
LORELAI,Corona right?,2
DEAN,"No, I don't want a beer! I don't drink beer. I'll have water or soda or anything. Or nothing. Not beer. Never beer. Beer is. . beer's bad.",2
EMILY,"Relax Dean, that's just Lorelai's little sense of humor. You're very cruel.",2
LORELAI,"Well, yes, keeps me young.",2
DEAN,I'm just gonna sit here and stare at my hands.,2
EMILY,Soda Dean?,2

DEAN,Should we do the beer thing again?,2
LORELAI,"Uh, I don't think so.",2
RORY,"Grandma, I can't believe you found the recipe for Beefaroni.",2
EMILY,It wasn't easy. Antonia thought I'd gone insane.,2
LORELAI,Well . . .,2
EMILY,No one needs a commen t from you.,2
LORELAI,"No, I was just gonna say, what's the secret?",2
EMILY,"Well, let's just say it's not beef.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, okay, I'm done.",2
RORY,Me too.,2
EMILY,"Dean, would you like some mo re?",2
DEAN,"Uh, no. I'm fine, thanks.",2
EMILY,"Well, then I guess it must be present time.",2
RORY,You didn't have to.,2
LORELAI,"Oh yeah, Mom, you didn't have to. Unless you got something that'll fit me too, in which case, good going.",2
EMILY,"Here you go, Rory. Congratulations, we're so proud.",2
RORY,Thanks Grandma. Thanks Grandpa.,2
EMILY,"Now go on, open it.",2
RORY,Okay.,2

RORY,It's beautiful.,2
LORELAI,I think the top student deserved the top tools.,2
RORY,Thank you so much. Really.,2
LORELAI,"Uh, uh, well, pens are very nice, but I just bet there is a fabulous fancy dessert just sitting out there in that kitchen of yours.",2
EMILY,As a matter of fact there is. Twinkies.,2
LORELAI,What?,2
EMILY,"Well, Rory told me that was her favorite dessert.",2
LORELAI,"Emily Gilmore, you are one classy broad.",2
EMILY,"Antonia, please bring out the Twinkies.",2
LORELAI,I can't believe I just heard you say those words.,2
EMILY,"Well, don't get used to it.",2
RICHARD,"So, Dean, where are you planning to go to college?",2
DEAN,"Oh, uh, well I. . .",2
LORELAI,"Geez Dad, start off with 'what's your favorite baseball team' or something.",2
RICHARD,I'm talking to Dean.,2
DEAN,I don't know yet.,2
RICHARD,You don't?,2
DEAN,"No, not yet.",2
RICHARD,"Well, what kind of grades do you get?",2
EMILY,"Richard please, don't grill the boy.",2
RICHARD,"I'm not grilling the boy Emily. It's an easy question. A's, B's, C's?",2
DEAN,I get a mixture actually.,2
RICHARD,Mixture? What's the ratio?,2
EMILY,Richard.,2
RICHARD,"I'm just trying to get to know the boy Emily. After all, Rory brings home a young man to dinner, the least we can do is learn something about him.",2
LORELAI,He changes a mean water bottle.,2
DEAN,"I get a couple A's, couple B's, few C's.",2
RICHARD,Really?,2
DEAN,I'm not great in math.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, except who is really? You know, except mathematicians or the blackjack dealers, or I guess Stephen Hawking doesn't suck, but you know  You know what else is good though Mom, is a Ho-Ho. Because if you can't find a Twinkie, you know, treat yourself to a nice Ho-Ho. How long does it take to open a box?",2
EMILY,She's making them.,2
LORELAI,She's making the Twinkies? You're kidding.,2
EMILY,"Oh Richard, wasn't there a book you wanted to give Rory?",2
RICHARD,In a minute. So Dean. . .,2
RORY,"Uh, Grandpa?",2
RICHARD,You do know that Rory is going to an Ivy League school?,2
DEAN,I know.,2
RICHARD,"Harvard, Princeton, Yale.",2
LORELAI,He said he knew Dad.,2
RICHARD,You need top grades to get into a top school.,2
DEAN,"Yeah, well, Rory's really smart.",2
RICHARD,"Yeah, she is really smart.",2
RORY,Mom?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, why don't we all go sit in the uh. . .",2
RICHARD,"So, how are you planning to make a living once you graduate from this college you haven't thought anything about yet?",2
RORY,"Grandpa, can we talk about something else?",2
EMILY,I'm going to get that book.,2
RICHARD,I asked you a question.,2
DEAN,I don't know what I want to do.,2
RICHARD,"You know, when I was ten years old, I knew exactly where I wanted to work.",2
LORELAI,That's because you were always picked last for dodgeball.,2
RICHARD,"I knew I wanted to go to Yale, and put on a nice suit everyday and be a very important man in a very powerful firm. And I knew I wanted to travel and see the world.",2
DEAN,"Well, that's great.",2
RICHARD,I wanted to see La Traviata at the La Scala Operahouse. I wanted to walk the ruins of Pompeii. I wanted to travel the far east . . .,2
LORELAI,And be a ballerina or a fireman.,2
RICHARD,"Lorelai, this isn't funny.",2
LORELAI,It's a little funny to think of a ten-year-old kid dreaming of the La Scala Operahouse.,2
RICHARD,Rory does. Rory wants to travel. Rory has plans.,2
LORELAI,Rory's special.,2
RICHARD,Yes. Exactly. Rory is special,2
DEAN,"Well, I know that Rory is special.",2
EMILY,I got it.,2
RORY,"Dean is special too, Grandpa.",2
DEAN,Rory.,2
RORY,You don't even know him.,2
RICHARD,I know enough.,2
RORY,No you don't. Dean is incredible and he's special to me and I bring him here and you attack him.,2
RICHARD,I will not be spoken to like that in my house.,2
EMILY,"Richard here, give her the book.",2
RICHARD,"This family has standards. You live up to them, and you should expect that everyone that you spend time w ith live up to them also. You are a gifted girl with immense promise, and you should learn very early that certain people can hold you back.",2
RORY,"Grandpa, stop it! You cannot treat Dean this way.",2
RICHARD,"I'm sorry, excuse me, I have to work.",2
RORY,"Grandpa! Thank you for the dinner and the gift Grandma, but I really think we should be going.",2
DEAN,Thanks. Sorry.,2
LORELAI,Am I crazy? That's supposed to be us right?,2
LORELAI,"Well, want to come in and have some dessert? You never did get your Twinkie.",2
DEAN,"Uh, no thanks. I think I should get going.",2
RORY,Are you sure?,2
DEAN,Yeah.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, well, Dean, all I can say is that tonight, you officially became a Gilmore Girl. Feels good, huh?",2
DEAN,Yeah.,2
LORELAI,See you later. Meet you inside.,2
RORY,I don't even know what to say.,2
DEAN,It's no big deal.,2
RORY,I had no idea I thought he would I am so sorry Dean.,2
DEAN,It's not your fault.,2
RORY,None of those things he said were true. None of them mean anything. I don't know what made him act that way. I just. . .,2
DEAN,"You know what, let's just forget it. All right?",2
RORY,"Please, don't be upset.",2
DEAN,I'm not.,2
RORY,Dean.,2
DEAN,I'm fine. I'm not upset. I have to go. Call you tomorrow.,2
RORY,Okay.,2
RORY,That man is impossible.,2
LORELAI,Twinkie?,2
RORY,"He just att*cked Dean out of nowhere. And Dean is sitting there, being perfectly nice, and then all of a sudden. . . Ugh, God, I'm so mad. He's a snob.",2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
RORY,And he doesn't listen. He just wants to say horrible things and have you sit there and listen to him and then just agree with him. What is that all about?,2
LORELAI,"Ah, that is about a hundred years worth of inbreeding.",2
RORY,"I've never seen him be mean before. Ever, not like that. I don't know how I'll ever talk to him again. And Dean. He must be so upset right now. I hate that he did this to him, I hate it.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, it was bad. My father was in fine form tonight. But. . .",2
RORY,"But? There's a but, from you there's a but?",2
LORELAI,"Twinkie. I don't think my father has ever loved anything in this world as much as he loves you. Now, that having been established, let's just consider that maybe this flipout tonight actually came from somewhere that possibly has nothing to do with Dean and very possibly has nothing to do with you.",2
RORY,What are you talking about?,2
LORELAI,You are the great white hope of the Gilmore clan. You are their angel sent from up above. You are the daughter they didn't have.,2
RORY,Mom.,2
LORELAI,"No, it's not a 'feel sorry for me' thing. It's just the truth. I mean, you're gonna go to college. Hell, you're gonna graduate from high school. They're gonna get to watch you walk down the aisle wearing your cap and gown and get your diploma and go to Harvard and be a Phi Beta Bimbo and graduate with honors and just set the world on fire. And that is the plan, looks like it's gonna happen.",2
RORY,It is going to happen. Except for that Phi Beta Bimbo part.,2
LORELAI,"But then tonight you walk in with this beautiful boy who likes you enough to brave going to your grandparents house for dinner, and Dad looks at you and sees you with him and all of a sudden, has a terrible Lorelai flashback. He sees it all going away, the college, the cap and gown and. . .",2
RORY,But I'm not going to get pregnant.,2
LORELAI,I know that.,2
RORY,He should know it.,2
LORELAI,"Yes, he should, but you do have my eyes.",2
RORY,You do realize you just spent the last ten minutes defending your dad.,2
LORELAI,"I know. I'm gonna have terrible nightmares all night long. But I'll tell you what. If you cut him a little slack, I'll wear my porn star t-shirt to dinner next week.",2
RORY,Deal.,2
LORELAI,Good.,2
RORY,Hello?,2
LANE,"I just thought you should know that my parents just brought in the suitcase that I'm supposed to take on my trip and to paint you a picture, it can fit you and me plus everything we own and still have enough room to do a little souvenir shopping. I am never coming back.",2
RICHARD,"What is Lorelai thinking letting Rory run around with a boy like that. Well, of course, she isn't thinking! She never thinks.",2
EMILY,"Richard, please, you're giving me a headache.",2
RICHARD,And what were you thinking inviting him over here?,2
EMILY,We told her she could invite someone. You were right there.,2
RICHARD,I did not mean him.,2
EMILY,Please calm down.,2
RICHARD,I will not calm down. Did you hear the way she talked to me?,2
EMILY,"Yes, I heard the way she talked to you.",2
RICHARD,She sounded like her mother.,2
EMILY,You were attacking her boyfriend.,2
RICHARD,A girl that age shouldn't have a boyfriend.,2
EMILY,You truly think a sixteen year old girl isn't gonna date?,2
RICHARD,"Well, of course she's going to date, and she should date. The proper socialization is important to a child. But she should not date one boy and she should not date him. Don't answer that.",2
EMILY,I'm going to answer it.,2
RICHARD,"Emily, we are in the middle of a discussion.",2
EMILY,I'm sure you will rememb er exactly where you were five minutes from now. Hello?,2
SOOKIE,"Hi, Mrs. Gilmore? It's Sookie St. James, Lorelai's friend. I don't know if you remember me.",2
EMILY,"Oh yes, you're the chef at the Inn.",2
SOOKIE,"That's right. Listen, I'm sorry to call so late, but I need to ask you a question. I'm planning a surprise wedding shower for Lorelai and Max, and it's gonna be more like a big party actually. But I've cleared the date with everybody around here, so we're all set to go, but I wanted to make sure you guys were gonna be around before I finalized everything. It's going to be Saturday the 21st.",2
EMILY,"I don't know, I'd have to check.",2
SOOKIE,"Okay, Okay. You check, and then you call me at the inn, okay?",2
EMILY,"Yes, I'll get back to you.",2
SOOKIE,Okay.,2
EMILY,I want you to call Rory tomorrow and apologize.,2
RICHARD,What?,2
EMILY,I want you to call her and tell her you're sorry. That you weren't feeling well and you think that Dean is a lovely boy and he's welcome here anytime.,2
RICHARD,Have you gone insane? Under no circumstance will I ...,2
EMILY,"Our daughter is getting married. She's getting married and she didn't tell us. When Rory decides to get married, I'd like her to tell us. Call her tomorrow.",2
LORELAI,It was awful.,2
MAX,Sounds awful.,2
LORELAI,That's the family you want to marry into.,2
MAX,I must be insane.,2
LORELAI,,2
MAX,"Hmm, and speaking of marrying into.",2
LORELAI,Yes?,2
MAX,I have a little something for you.,2
LORELAI,"Let me guess. Is it gum, 'cause you know how much I like gum. How concerned I am about dental hygiene. Uh, oh my.",2
MAX,You like?,2
LORELAI,It's beautiful.,2
MAX,"Oh, it's too big.",2
LORELAI,"No, it's not.",2
MAX,"Here, give it to me.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, what? No, you can't have it back.",2
MAX,"Well, I'll get it sized.",2
LORELAI,"No, it's okay.",2
MAX,"Well, it's gonna fall off.",2
LORELAI,I'll wear it on my thumb.,2
MAX,You're not gonna wear it on your thumb.,2
LORELAI,I'll eat a lot of salt and bloat up.,2
MAX,"Just let me get it sized and I promise you'll never have to take it off again. In fact, I'm going to insist on it.",2
LORELAI,"No, just in a minute, okay?",2
MAX,Okay.,2

LORELAI,Rory!,2
RORY,Living room!,2
LORELAI,I need your advice on something. What do you think?,2
RORY,Huh.,2
LORELAI,Not good?,2
RORY,I'm not sure. Have you tried the Arts and Leisure section?,2
LORELAI,I need you to be serious.,2
RORY,You are wearing a newspaper on your head.,2
LORELAI,I know.,2
RORY,And you need me to be serious?,2
LORELAI,I am trying to figure out veil lengths here.,2
RORY,"Oh, well sure.",2
LORELAI,"See, I kind of like this shoulder length kind of semi-poofy thing like this.",2
RORY,Mm hmm.,2
LORELAI,But there's also a longer one that might be interesting.,2
RORY,"Longer, sure.",2
LORELAI,And then there's the full on Diana.,2
Posted,10/21/01 11:00,2
RORY,"Right, right.",2
LORELAI,Which is nice but it just might be a little. . . . You're reading me.,2
RORY,"Wait, don't move.",2
LORELAI,"Rory, stop it.",2
RORY,This Putin arms race thing is really getting crazy.,2
LORELAI,I am trying to have a serious conversation about the most important fashion decision of my life.,2
RORY,Why don't you go to a wedding dress place and try a real veil on?,2
LORELAI,No way.,2
RORY,Why?,2
LORELAI,"Too much taffeta, it gives me cotillion flashbacks.",2
RORY,Okay fine. Could you bend over so I can see what the weather's gonna be like tomorrow?,2
LORELAI,"Actually, I went in one of those places yesterday.",2
RORY,You did? Which one?,2
LORELAI,Marry Mimi's.,2
RORY,"Ooh, I see we're going top of the line.",2
LORELAI,"Ugh, it was horrible. Apparently, you're supposed to order your wedding dress the first day of junior high, and if you haven't, it's off the rack for you missy. I tried on three different dresses, one of which gave me a r ash. And I gotta say, has anyone missed the bustle? 'Cause I haven't.",2
RORY,It was not that bad.,2
LORELAI,"They all looked wrong. I'm gonna be gross and all the children will laugh and Max will realize he's made a horrible mistake and then people will walk away, exactly as you're doing now.",2
RORY,Let's go.,2
LORELAI,Where?,2
RORY,Wedding dress shopping.,2
LORELAI,"Uhhh, you're reading.",2
RORY,I'm done.,2
LORELAI,"Uh, you need to see Dean.",2
RORY,He's playing softball.,2
LORELAI,Your cure for cancer's almost finished.,2
RORY,"We are going to find the perfect thing for you to walk down the aisle in your perfect wedding day, where there will be no pointing, mocking or walking out.",2
LORELAI,"I did not say pointing, why did you say pointing?",2
RORY,Keys.,2
LORELAI,,2
LOUISE,"Ooh, spending the summer at Chilton. Happy happy, joy joy.",2
MADELINE,"If I don't improve my French grades, I can kiss Vassar goodbye.",2
PARIS,You need to follow a study schedule. I've been telling you this second grade.,2
LOUISE,"Yes, which worries both of us.",2
MADELINE,Maybe I won't go to college.,2
PARIS,You have to go to college.,2
LOUISE,Princess Grace didn't go to college.,2
PARIS,"Thank you for the history lesson, A.J. Benza.",2
LOUISE,Take a pill.,2
PARIS,Marry rich.,2
MADELINE,Hey.,2
RORY,Hey.,2
MADELINE,You doing the summer school thing too?,2

RORY,"Well, I uh ",2
LOUISE,Ahem.,2
MADELINE,What?,2
RORY,"Uh, you're not talking to me.",2
MADELINE,I'm not?,2
LOUISE,Tristin.,2
PARIS,PJ Harvey.,2
MADELINE,Oh yeah.,2
RORY,"I'm just gonna look at the bulletin board, and then you can back to your conversation.",2
MADELINE,"There's a Rebuilding Together thing going on tomorrow. You know, they fix up homes for the needy. It's a total easy outdoor denim gig that looks really great on your college transcript. Sorry.",2
RORY,"Thanks, I'll think about it.",2
PARIS,You wouldn't like it.,2
RORY,'Cause you'll be there?,2
PARIS,"Yes, I'll be there.",2
RORY,I'll think about it.,2
PARIS,You don't want to go.,2
RORY,I'll see.,2
PARIS,"You don't, it's not you.",2
RORY,I have multiple personalities. It might be one of me.,2
PARIS,It's hours of hammer ing and drilling and dirt and it's horrible. You'll hate it.,2
RORY,"How do you know? How do you know that I don't spend hours every week hammering and drilling? And dirt, I love dirt. I collect it.",2
PARIS,You're hilarious.,2
RORY,You're pathetic.,2
PARIS,Fine. Forget it.,2
RORY,Why don't you want me to go?,2
PARIS,I don't care if you go.,2
RORY,You just spent a great deal of energy trying to convince me not to.,2
PARIS,I'm late for class.,2
RORY,Are you seriously going to be mad about the fact that you thought I was going out with Tristin even though I wasn't for the rest of your life?,2
PARIS,I have great commit ment.,2
RORY,And you don't see how stupid that is?,2
PARIS,"I'm sorry if you thought we had some kind of deep Thelma and Louise thing going here, but we didn't.",2
RORY,"Well, have it your way, but I'm going tomorrow.",2
PARIS,Fine. Go. See if I care.,2
RORY,I will.,2
PARIS,Great. I hate summer .,2
HENRY,Rory?,2
RORY,"Oh, Henry, hi. Nice to see you.",2
HENRY,You too. What classes are you taking?,2
RORY,"Shakespeare, physics, obscure Russian poetry.",2
HENRY,"Wow. I'm still trying to get through trig. But hey, third time's the charm.",2
RORY,I can help you if you want.,2
HENRY,I just may take you up on that.,2
RORY,Okay.,2
HENRY,Okay.,2
RORY,Lane's fine.,2
HENRY,"Is she? Good, 'cause I haven't talked to her in awhile. I called.",2
RORY,Yeah?,2
HENRY,Once. I called once.,2
RORY,And?,2
HENRY,Her mother answered.,2
RORY,Oops.,2
HENRY,She sounded angry.,2
RORY,"No, that's just Mrs. Kim.",2
HENRY,"I hung up. Twelve times. And then on the thirteenth time she said she was gonna have the FBI trace the call and have me thrown in prison. And although I know logically that the punishment for multiple hang ups probably isn't prison, she just sounded so capable of doing real damage that I. . .",2
RORY,Stopped calling?,2
HENRY,"And now Lane probably thinks that I forgot about her, and. . .",2
RORY,You'd like for me to tell her that you haven't.,2
HENRY,That would be good.,2
RORY,Done.,2
HENRY,And maybe you could give her my number and she could call me.,2
RORY,I'll get right on it.,2
HENRY,Aw thanks. Thank you.,2
RORY,Uh huh.,2
HENRY,Okay. Bye,2
RORY,"Bye. Uh, henry?",2
HENRY,What?,2
RORY,Your trig notes.,2
HENRY,Ahhh.,2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,"Mom, tomorrow I'm going to build a house.",2
RORY,Help build a house.,2
LORELAI,Did you tell them that there's a light bulb in your closet that burned out in '97 that you still haven't changed?,2
RORY,It's for charity.,2
LORELAI,"Wow, don't those people have enough problems without having you as a contractor?",2
RORY,I'm sure there will be real construction workers there.,2
LORELAI,Oh.,2
RORY,"I will be assisting, I will be helping out those less fortunate than myself, I will be getting college credit and this is the end of this particular conversation.",2
LORELAI,"You're right. It's a good thing. Nice, keeps your halo shiny. Oh wait, wait.",2
RORY,When are you going to tell them?,2
LORELAI,Soon.,2
RORY,When's soon?,2
LORELAI,"When the big hand hits the ""S"" and the little hand hits the ""OON.""",2
RORY,You're getting married in three months.,2
LORELAI,Ring the bell.,2
RORY,I think you should tell them now.,2
LORELAI,Ring the bell.,2
RORY,The longer you wait the harder it's gonna be.,2
LORELAI,"For the love of God, will you please ring the bell.",2
RORY,You can tell them before dinner.,2
LORELAI,"I will tell them when I'm ready to tell them. You have to accept that because I'm the mother and you're the daughter, and in some cultures, that means you have to do what I say.",2
RORY,"If you don't tell them in two weeks, I will.",2
LORELAI,Though apparently not in this one.,2
RORY,Good.,2
EMILY,"We're going to have to eat quickly, your father has a very early flight tomorrow morning.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, I'm good. Yeah, and Rory's gonna build a house tomorrow. I know, I thought it was a little weird too.",2
EMILY,Walk as you babble please.,2
LORELAI,Somebody must have scratched the silver.,2
EMILY,"Bring the bread out too. And pour the wine please. Come on, hurry up.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, 'cause we don't want our salad to get cold.",2
EMILY,"Richard, dinner!",2
LORELAI,Mom.,2
EMILY,Eat eat.,2
LORELAI,Shouldn't we wait for Dad?,2
EMILY,Don't worry about him.,2
LORELAI,"He's the one with the early plane. We don't have to go anywhere tomorrow. We can stay all night. Have a party, do some Jell-O sh*ts, play light as a feather, stiff as a board. Okay, pass the bread.",2
RORY,"Grandma, would you like some. . .",2
EMILY,Yes please.,2
RICHARD,You started.,2
EMILY,You have a six o'clock flight.,2
RICHARD,"Six o'clock, are you sure?",2
EMILY,"What do you mean, am I sure? Of course I'm sure. I double-checked it three times with your secretary because I know she's an idiot and all three times she told me six o'clock. I wrote it down, I have your ticket right out on the. . . You're teasing me.",2
RICHARD,Very possible.,2
EMILY,"I don't find that amusing, Richard.",2
RICHARD,"Exactly the point of teasing, Emily. Hello Lorelai.",2
LORELAI,Hello Father.,2
RICHARD,Rory.,2
RORY,Grandpa.,2
RICHARD,"May I speak with you for a moment, please?",2
RORY,Okay.,2
LORELAI,,2
RICHARD,"I just thought we should touch base, you and I, after that unfortunate incident last week.",2
RORY,"Grandpa, you already called me about that.",2
RICHARD,"Yes, I know, but I thought taking a moment to once again say to you in person, how. . .",2
RORY,"I know, and I appreciate it.",2
RICHARD,We'd never had a fight.,2
RORY,No.,2
RICHARD,This was our first one.,2
RORY,Yes it was.,2
RICHARD,"And I must say, I didn't care for it.",2
RORY,Neither did I.,2
RICHARD,"Well, all right. We should go back inside. We're find now, right?",2
RORY,"We're fine. Buck up, Private.",2
RICHARD,"Oh wait, I wanted to give you something.",2
RORY,What?,2
RICHARD,"Come on, come on.",2
LORELAI,"Hey, where you guys going?",2
RICHARD,We'll be right there.,2
LORELAI,"Well, hurry, 'cause you're missing one hell of a conversation. You know, Mom, I'm really loving this salad dressing.",2
EMILY,I'm glad.,2
LORELAI,Lemony.,2
EMILY,Yes.,2
LORELAI,There's nothing like a nice salad of lemony goodness. Mom?,2
EMILY,Hmm?,2
LORELAI,I have something to tell you.,2
EMILY,Yes?,2
LORELAI,"Well it's like this. Um, . . .could you put down your fork for a second? Thank you. Okay, um, you know Max?",2
EMILY,"No, I don't.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, I know you don't know him know him, but you know of him, right?",2
EMILY,I've heard rumblings.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, well, um, the. . .Max and I have been serious for quite awhile now, and he asked me to marry him, and I said yes. I'm getting married.",2
EMILY,,2
RORY,Are you okay?,2
LORELAI,I'm perfect.,2
RORY,Really?,2
LORELAI,I have hit a level of perfection that has rarely been seen outside the Victoria's Secret catalog.,2
RORY,I'm really sorry.,2
LORELAI,"Aww, do not be sorry. What happened tonight was inevitable.",2
RORY,Mom.,2
LORELAI,I should've known not to tell my mother.,2
RORY,You were trying to be nice.,2
LORELAI,"Telling her I was getting married to a wonderful guy who will love me and make me happy. That, and giving her my address when I finally moved out, two worst moves I ever made.",2
RORY,Maybe she'll think about it and call you and say she's sorry.,2
LORELAI,"Mom, I'm getting married. I'm an idiot. And you know, as my mouth was opening my mind was screaming, 'Don't do it, I mean it, you'll regret it!' But did my mouth listen?",2
RORY,No.,2
LORELAI,"No! And it opened and the words came out, and Emily was Emily, and my mouth was stunned. And my mind said 'I told you so.' And then my mouth got mad because no mouth like's to have it's nose rubbed in it. And now my mind and my mouth aren't talking, and it'll be weeks before we can get the boys together again.",2
RORY,Your mouth has a nose?,2
LORELAI,"God, I'm crabby.",2
RORY,You're hungry.,2
LORELAI,No I'm not.,2
RORY,Well you didn't eat any of your dinner.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, well, by the time I could get my jaw off the ground, Speed Racer had taken my plate.",2
RORY,"Luke will cheer you up, won't you Luke?",2
LUKE,"Oh sure, I'm great at spreading the joy. What'll you have?",2
RORY,We'll have two coffees and a rant meal please. Extra cheese.,2
LORELAI,No.,2
RORY,Why?,2
LORELAI,"I'm through ranting, the rant is over. I'll have an acceptance meal and a side of fries.",2
RORY,"Please, you have not accepted this.",2
LORELAI,I am a grown woman. I do not need my mother's permission or blessing to be happy.,2
LUKE,Must've been a good Oprah today.,2
LORELAI,Just a little family drama. No biggie.,2
RORY,It's a little biggie.,2
LUKE,"Yeah, what's going on?",2
LORELAI,I told my mother about me getting married and it was slightly ugly.,2
LUKE,Yup.,2
LORELAI,"Yup, what?",2
LUKE,"Well, there's nothing like a wedding to screw up a family.",2
LORELAI,"Actually, in my case, there's nothing like a family to screw up a family.",2
LUKE,"Something that's supposed to start nice, two people making promises to each other. I'll love you forever, I wanna die when you die, my life meant nothing until you used my toothbrush. And then it starts.",2
LORELAI,"Well, that's not exactly. .",2
LUKE,"Who do you invite, who sits where, open bar, yes or no. . .",2
LORELAI,Luke?,2
LUKE,"Auntie Junie doesn't eat chicken, Uncle Momo's off his meds.",2
LORELAI,Junie and Momo?,2
LUKE,Just an example.,2
LORELAI,Of a retired circus couple?,2
LUKE,"And then after all that planning, the reception will still be a disaster because no matter what you do or how carefully you plan, halfway through one of those nauseating Bette Midler ballads, someone's getting drunk, someone's sleeping with someone else's wife, and someone's chicken kiev is landing on the cake.",2
LORELAI,"You know, the Gettysburg Address was only one page long, and that was about a w*r.",2
LUKE,I just call them like I seem them.,2
LORELAI,I have officially changed my order. I'll have the 'Luke's giving Lorelai a Migraine' meal.,2
LUKE,Bleu cheese or ranch?,2
LORELAI,Both.,2
LUKE,,2
RORY,Time?,2
LORELAI,8:30.,2
RORY,I'm late.,2
LORELAI,"Hold on, coffee!",2
RORY,Thanks. I'll see you tonight.,2
LORELAI,"Wait, one sec.",2
RORY,"Mom, I have to be there in twenty minutes.",2
LORELAI,"I know, but I made you something really cool.",2
RORY,Can't it wait 'til tonight?,2
LORELAI,It won't be cool tonight.,2
RORY,What do you mean it won't be cool tonight? What loses its cool factor in twelve hours?,2
LORELAI,This.,2
RORY,What is that?,2
LORELAI,A hammer .,2
RORY,It has feathers on it.,2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
RORY,Why?,2
LORELAI,So the rhinestones and bows won't feel lonely.,2
RORY,What do you want me to do it?,2
LORELAI,Build a really pretty house.,2
RORY,How long is it gonna take me to talk you out of giving that to me?,2
LORELAI,"Forty minutes, an hour, tops.",2
RORY,Hand it over.,2
LORELAI,"Call me w hen you get home, and please be careful.",2
RORY,I will.,2
LORELAI,"I mean it Timmy, no falling down the well.",2
RORY,Bye.,2
LORELAI,Bye.,2
RORY,"Oh, geez, you scared me.",2
LANE,Sorry. Where you going?,2
RORY,I'm doing that Rebuilding Together thing today.,2
LANE,"Right. I'll be fast. Okay. Here's my CD's, my 'zines, my posters, my books, three of your sweaters, and one Diva Glam lipstick. I need to leave them here while I'm in Korea because my mother's bound to search my room and if she finds them, she'll throw them out. And then spend the rest of the summer praying for my soul.",2
RORY,I'll treat them like my own.,2
LANE,"Okay, now. This is the Lane Kim retrieval kit. It contains the phone number of my cousins in Korea, a map of the house I'll be staying at, a picture of me now, and a mock-up of me in 6 months.",2
RORY,You've lost some w eight.,2
LANE,"Now this is that name of that guy at the American Consulate, and several important Korean phrases written out phonetically, you know, 'Help', 'Have you seen this girl,' 'Comes from money', et cetera.",2
RORY,Still no return date info from the parents?,2
LANE,"Nope, but they did buy me a w inter coat.",2
RORY,When are you going?,2
LANE,Right after your mom's engagement par...,2
RORY,Shhhh!,2
LANE,Do you think she heard me?,2
RORY,"I don't think so. No, she'd be in here grilling us for details if she had.",2
LANE,She wouldn't have pretended not to have heard so she wouldn't k*ll the surprise?,2
RORY,And risk clashing with the decor?,2
LANE,"Right. Okay, I gotta go.",2
RORY,"Hey, Henry?",2
LANE,Called him.,2
RORY,And?,2
LANE,,2
DEAN,Hey.,2
RORY,Hi.,2
DEAN,Where you going?,2
RORY,I have to build a house.,2
DEAN,"Okay, so where you going?",2
RORY,I'm serious.,2
DEAN,You're going to build a house?,2
RORY,"It's for charity and I'm late, and why don't you go on inside and you and my mother can continue the 'Rory's building a house' routine and when that gets boring you can move on over to 'Who's on First?'",2
DEAN,"Well, how long are you gonna be gone?",2
RORY,"I don't know, why?",2
DEAN,"I just thought we could hang today. Maybe see a movie, get something to eat. We could go to a bookstore, I'll watch you browse for six or seven hours.",2
RORY,I would love to but I have to do this thing today.,2
DEAN,Blow it off.,2
RORY,I can't.,2
DEAN,Did I mention the bookstore for six or seven hours?,2
RORY,"How about tonight? We can get a pizza and go on Amazon. You'll be just as bored watching me ordering books, I promise.",2
DEAN,Deal.,2
RORY,,2
RORY,Excuse me.,2
MAN,"Hey, you're touching a man with a saw. You don't touch a man with a saw. What are you thinking?",2
RORY,I'm sorry.,2
MAN,I could've hurt myself. I could've hurt you. There's a ton of hurt that almost happened here.,2
RORY,I really am sorry. I've never been on a job site before. It's nice.,2
MAN,"Okay, where you from?",2
RORY,Chilton. My name. . .,2
MAN,Come on Chilton.,2
RORY,"No, it's Rory. Chilton's my school.",2
MAN,You got a hammer ?,2
RORY,"Oh, yes, sir.",2
MAN,Where is it?,2
RORY,It's a real hammer underneath.,2
MAN,That's a hammer ?,2
RORY,"Well, it's just dressed up a little.",2
MAN,You dressed up a hammer ?,2
RORY,"No, my mother did. She does that. She, um, she takes thinks that aren't pretty and makes them pretty, like a hammer , you know. One time she made individual outfits for my liquid paper bottles. A clown, a cowboy, a newscaster. She's not insane, she just sounds it.",2
MAN,"Okay. Work here. Wear these. Don't look up, pay attention to your surroundings, the words duck or run mean duck or run. Wear sunscreen, drunk water, get a button on the way out.",2
RORY,That's it? That's the instructions?,2
MAN,Yup.,2
RORY,But I've never done this before.,2
MAN,"Well, tomorrow you won't be able to say that.",2
RORY,But people actually have to live in these houses. They may have kids or pets or breakables.,2
MAN,"If you get in trouble, ask the person next to you.ANOTHER",2
MAN,Uh look out!,2
MAN,"Hey, you learn fast. I didn't even mention that one.",2
PARIS,This is my wall.,2
RORY,What?,2
PARIS,I've been working here. I put together this entire wall. Go work someplace else.,2
RORY,You put together this wall?,2
PARIS,Go help with cement.,2
RORY,It's very impressive.,2
PARIS,"I've done it a million times before. It's no big deal. Louise! What did I just tell you, use a grub axe for that!",2
LOUISE,Bite me!,2
RORY,Funny. I never pictured you as a Bob Vila kind of girl.,2
PARIS,Rebuilding Together is an extremely prestigious and respected organization. I've been volunteering for them for years.,2
RORY,Really? You just love the overalls?,2
PARIS,I don't. Harvard does.,2
RORY,What does that mean?,2
PARIS,"When you apply to an ivy league school, you need more than good grades and test scores to get you in. Every person who applies to Harvard has a perfect GPA and great test scores. It's the extras that put you over the top. The clubs, charities, volunteering. You know.",2
RORY,"Oh yeah, I know.",2
PARIS,"I started volunteering in fourth grade. I handed out cookies at the local children's hospital. By ten, I was leading my first study group. The youngest person in the group was twelve.",2
RORY,Wow.,2
PARIS,"I've been a camp counselor. I organized a senior illiteracy program, I worked a su1c1de hotline, I manned a runaway center. I've adopted dolphins, taught sign language, trained seeing eye dogs.",2
RORY,But when did you have time to have a life?,2
PARIS,"I'll have a life after I graduate from Harvard. Now if you'll excuse me, the drainage on the south side of this place sucks.",2
MADELINE,Hi!,2
PARIS,Madeline!,2
MADELINE,,2
DEAN,Hey. You look good in dirt.,2
RORY,"Dean, hi.",2
DEAN,So how was it?,2
RORY,Long day. Long long day.,2
DEAN,"The day is over. Let's talk about the night. Uh, there's a 7:30 showing of Barbarella, and I thought you can bring your mom's purse, you know the one with that monkey face and we'll sneak in some burgers and. . . what?",2
RORY,I can't.,2
DEAN,Get your mom's purse?,2
RORY,I can't do anything tonight.,2
DEAN,Why not?,2
RORY,Because I have a lot of planning to do.,2
DEAN,What planning?,2
RORY,I'm like ten years behind on my extracurriculars.,2
DEAN,What are you talking about?,2
RORY,"Paris has been accumulating these things since she could walk. I mean, she has a list of good deeds that could bump Mother Teresa off the Harvard list.",2
DEAN,"Okay, I'm lost.",2
RORY,"I've been studying my butt off my whole life and I really thought that that was enough, but then Paris tells me that everyone makes good grades and it's the extras that put you over the top. And I thought that she was messing with me like she always does, but she's right. I mean, it makes total sense.",2
DEAN,What does?,2
RORY,"Good grades aren't enough. I need to do things. I need to volunteer. I need to work for charity, I need to help the blind, the orphans, I don't know. I just need to do something.",2
DEAN,"Fine, but what does this have to do with tonight?",2
RORY,I need to start now.,2
DEAN,Now? You have to help the blind and the orphans now?,2
RORY,Didn't I tell you that I was ten years behind?,2
DEAN,Well you can't make up for ten years in one night Rory.,2
RORY,I know. I just need to get organized.,2
DEAN,"Well, Rory, it's summer . I mean, summer's the time to hang out and kick back.",2
RORY,"I can't hang out or kick back. I need to find a Ret*rded kid and teach him how to play softball. Oh God, listen to me. I am horrible. I am under qualified and horrible.",2
DEAN,Wait a minute. I thought we were gonna spend some time together.,2
RORY,We are.,2
DEAN,When?,2
RORY,I don't know. Tomorrow maybe?,2
DEAN,You were busy today.,2
RORY,I told you. . .,2
DEAN,So we made plans for tonight.,2
RORY,Yes but. . .,2
DEAN,And now you're blowing me off again.,2
RORY,I am not blowing you off.,2
DEAN,You're going to summer school three days a week.,2
RORY,You knew about that.,2
DEAN,"Yes, but we've been apart for awhile now and I figured you'd want to spend some time with me.",2
RORY,"Dean, this is about Harvard.",2
DEAN,"Oh, well excuse me, it's about Harvard, I forgot. Okay, fine.",2
RORY,You're mad? You're mad because I want to be sure that I get into a good college?,2
DEAN,"Nope, I'm mad because my girlfriend doesn't seem to have time for me anymore.",2
RORY,"Dean, stop it. This is important.",2
DEAN,And it can't wait for one night?,2
RORY,No.,2
DEAN,Fine.,2
RORY,Why are you acting like this?,2
DEAN,Like what?,2
RORY,Like you're two.,2
DEAN,,2
LORELAI,"Okay, I'm officially way too tired to go out tonight so I'm not trusting my accessorizing instincts. Tell me w hat you think.",2
RORY,I have no wilderness skills.,2
LORELAI,So you hate the purse?,2
RORY,How am I supposed to get into Harvard if I have no wilderness skills?,2
LORELAI,I don't know honey. Maybe you'll have to give up your dream of majoring in logging.,2
RORY,"I called the Fireflies. Do they need troop leaders? Yes. Good, I'll be a troop leader. Great. The only catch is, it's summer . Camping season. I need wilderness skills. Why did you never take me camping?",2
LORELAI,Camping? Are you kidding? I couldn't get you to step on wet grass until you were three.,2
RORY,"If you had taken me camping, I'd have wilderness skills.",2
LORELAI,"Well, I'll tell you what. I'll take you upstairs. I'll throw you out the window. If you manage to grab that tree, I'll be your witness.",2
RORY,"I called the Sunnyside Home. Do they need any volunteers? And believe it or not, they don't, but they do need an accordion player for their Friday night polka party.",2
LORELAI,How come I never forced you to learn the accordion?,2
RORY,"The library was closed. I can call them tomorrow, but they only have twelve books so I'm not counting on that. The tutoring program at Chilton is still taking names. I guess I can do that but ",2
LORELAI,"Honey, calm down.",2
RORY,I'm not prepared. I will never catch up.,2
LORELAI,"You will catch up, but not in one night. You've made your lists and your calls, why don't you relax and call Dean to come over?",2
RORY,We're in a fight.,2
LORELAI,Why?,2
RORY,Because you never took me camping.,2
LORELAI,"Oh boy, I am really sucking tonight.",2
RORY,We were supposed to hang out and I told him I couldn't and he got made and we're in a fight.,2
LORELAI,"Ugh. Well, listen, why don't I cancel on Max tonight and I'll hang out here with you. We can make popcorn and reminisce about how I never forced you to become a missionary.",2
RORY,"No, go, I'm fine. I just need to focus on this.",2
LORELAI,"Well, I can help.",2
RORY,"No, I need to do this alone.",2
LORELAI,Are you sure?,2
RORY,I'm sure.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, well, I'm not gonna be home late. And listen, I would reconsider calling Dean. It's not his fault that you're so fabulous he can't think about anything else.",2
RORY,Bye Mom.,2
LORELAI,"I mean, he just sits in his room, eating Froot Loops out of the box, saying your name over and over and over.",2
RORY,Time is ticking.,2
LORELAI,"Rory, I love you Rory. Rory, I will not be ignored Rory ",2
RORY,Leave.,2
LORELAI,,2
MAX,You hate your dinner.,2
LORELAI,No I don't.,2
MAX,You've hardly touched it.,2
LORELAI,"Well, when somebody goes to all the trouble to make your entrée look like a little tiny hat, you hate to mess it up.",2
MAX,Is something wrong?,2
LORELAI,No.,2
MAX,You can tell me. That's what I'm here for.,2
LORELAI,I thought it was just for eye candy.,2
MAX,That too.,2
LORELAI,"I'm fine. It's just stuff, ya know. Rory's freaking out about not having enough extracurricular things to impress Harvard with.",2
MAX,I can help her with that.,2
LORELAI,I'm sure she would greatly appreciate it.,2
MAX,Is that all that's wrong?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, just a lot of stuff to think about, you know, for the wedding.",2
MAX,"I forget to tell you, I saw my parents today. They just wanted me to tell you how thrilled they are. My mother cried twice. She said you don't have to call her mom but you're welcome to if you want.",2
LORELAI,Really?,2
MAX,And then my father took me as ide and gave me a long talk about marriage and the many ways of making a wife happy.,2
LORELAI,"Ooh, a dirty talk.",2
MAX,Then they gave me this.,2
LORELAI,No they did not.,2
MAX,Yes they did too.,2
LORELAI,"Ah, did you tell them that we're paying for everything ourselves?",2
MAX,I did.,2
LORELAI,"Sookie's doing the cake, the ceremony's at my house, Patty's supplying the chairs  thirty five dollars?",2
MAX,It's the first of four installments. That way we can't spend it all in one place.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, that is so cute!",2
MAX,They just want to be involved.,2
LORELAI,"That's sweet, that's really sweet. Can I. . .thanks.",2
MAX,"Oh, and my mother even offered you her wedding dress.",2
LORELAI,Huh.,2
MAX,But since three of you could fit into that dress I took the liberty of declining it.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, I hope she wasn't insulted.",2
MAX,"No, I just told her you were wearing your mother's dress.",2
LORELAI,Ah.,2
MAX,"It doesn't matter whether you are or not, she just wanted to offer something.",2
LORELAI,Let's get dessert.,2
MAX,You okay?,2
LORELAI,I just think it's great. I think it's great that your parents are so happy and into everything. I. .that must be nice to have that.,2
MAX,"Well, why don't you think of it this way? Now they're kind of your parents too so you'll have that also.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, I will think of it like that. That is exactly how I will think of it.",2
MAX,Good.,2
LORELAI,"Because otherwise, I'd have to look at it like Max has parents who love him and care about him, and I have parents.",2
MAX,I didn't mean to upset you.,2
LORELAI,"I'm not upset. It's just, I can't get that one moment out of my mind. 'That's nice, I hope we're in town.' Who, who, who reacts like that? I mean, what sort of mind forms that reaction to 'Hey mom, I'm getting married'?",2
MAX,"Well, from everything you've told me about your parents, there's so much baggage between you guys ",2
LORELAI,You figure out a different way. You tap into compassion or family obligation or something. You don't react like that.,2
MAX,"I agree. It's wrong. But you can't change who they are, and you won't get anywhere trying to.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, you know what? I don't want to talk about my parents anymore. Okay, I don't want to speculate about them, I don't want to analyze them, I don't want to think about them anymore. We should go.",2
MAX,"Come on, it' still early. We'll go someplace else. Talk a little bit more?",2
LORELAI,,2
MAX,"Listen, I'm sorry tonight brought up all these bad feelings for you.",2
LORELAI,That's okay. Make a right.,2
MAX,But I bet this was harder for your mother then you think it is.,2
LORELAI,Uh huh.,2
MAX,"I mean, look what's happened to her over the last year. She was just getting back into your life, and suddenly, everything changes on her.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, that's gotta suck. Go right.",2
MAX,"You know, maybe once we get married, things will settle down, you two will be able to work it out. I mean, you never know, I might be able to help the situation, ya know, uh, act as a buffer or so.",2
LORELAI,,2
MAX,"Lorelai, hold on, ya know, I think I know what's going on here, and I gotta tell you, it's not a good idea.",2
LORELAI,This'll just take a second.,2
MAX,"I don't know, maybe you should wait until tomorrow, calm down a little, think this through, maybe you'll be able to be more objective.",2
LORELAI,You are not asleep. Come on!,2
MAX,You are way too emotional for this.,2
LORELAI,"No, I'm just emotional enough. Now if you like you can wait in the car because I really don't plan on being here that long.",2
EMILY,What on earth?,2
LORELAI,"Hi mom, do you have a sec to chat? Super.",2
EMILY,"Lorelai, what is this?",2
LORELAI,"I just wanted to see how you were, that's all.",2
EMILY,I'm fine.,2
LORELAI,"You are? Oh good, good. I'm glad that you're fine. I, however, am not fine.",2
EMILY,Your father and I were just about to go to bed. We can do this in the morning.,2
LORELAI,"Actually Mom, no. We can't do this in the morning. We really need to do this right now.",2
EMILY,Are you drunk?,2
LORELAI,"No, I'm not drunk. I'm confused.",2
EMILY,About what?,2
LORELAI,About you.,2
EMILY,And what about me confuses you Lorelai?,2
LORELAI,"Well, so many things. I mean, for example, why can't you keep a maid in this house? Imean, there must've been a thousand women who've gone through here in the thirty-two years that I've been alive, and not one of them could stick it out.",2
EMILY,And this is what we need to discuss right now?,2
LORELAI,"These are women from countries that have dictatorships and civil wars and death squads and all of that they survived, but five minutes working for Emily Gilmore, and people are begging for Castro.",2
EMILY,"All right, I'm going to bed now.",2
LORELAI,"And why is it that when your only daughter tells you that she is getting married, you can't muster up even a little enthusiasm? Even a little fake enthusiasm. Why don't you pretend that you care? I mean, this is the biggest thing to happen to me possibly for the rest of my life, and you dismissed it like I said, 'Hey, I'm thinking of getting a Honda, what do you think?'",2
EMILY,You're obviously hysterical!,2
LORELAI,"Why don't you care? Why have you never cared? No matter what has happened to me my entire life, you've never been happy for me, and that hurts, Mom, it really hurts!",2
EMILY,I'm not discussing this with you.,2
LORELAI,Do you know how it felt for me to tell you that I was getting married and to have you just brush it off like that? Do you know?,2
EMILY,"No, I don't, I don't know! Possibly very similar to finding out from a complete stranger that my only daughter was getting married and had told every other person in the world before she bothered to tell her own mother. Possibly it felt something like that. Now if you'll excuse me, it is late, and I am going to bed.",2
MAX,,2
MICHELorelai,I don't care.,2
SOOKIE,I just need a quick opinion.,2
MICHELorelai,It took me two seconds to tell you I don't care. That's as quick as I get.,2
SOOKIE,"This Lorelai's engagement party. It is a once in a lifetime event, and I want it to be perfect.",2
MICHELorelai,I am working.,2
SOOKIE,Just pick a cookie.,2
MICHELorelai,I don't want to.,2
SOOKIE,"Michel, for the rest of their lives, Lorelai and Max are gonna think back on their engagement party and they're gonna talk about three things. They're gonna talk about the friends who came, and that special song they danced to, and the cookies that they ate.",2
MICHELorelai,"Their world is very small, isn't it?",2
SOOKIE,Macaroons or chocolate pralines?,2
MICHELorelai,Go back to the cooking room.,2
SOOKIE,Not until you eat these and tell me what you think!,2
MICHELorelai,"Sookie! I only eat fifteen hundred calories a day. If I eat that, I cannot have my Boca burger later.",2
LORELAI,Hey Sookie. Is there any coffee left? I had a really lousy night.,2
SOOKIE,"Oh, sorry, ya know, I've been so busy I didn't even think about it.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, that's okay. I'll make some myself.",2
SOOKIE,"No! I'll make it! I'll make it! I wanna make it! I wanna make it! Let me do it! I wanna make  hey, I make the coffee!",2
LORELAI,"Sookie, relax, you're busy.",2
SOOKIE,,2
LORELAI,Oh my god. What is this?,2
SOOKIE,"Uh, the dinner special?",2
LORELAI,The dinner special is a heart shaped pastry with Max and Lorelai written on it?,2
SOOKIE,I couldn't find any good salmon.,2
LORELAI,"Oh Sookie, you're throwing me a wedding shower, aren't you?",2
SOOKIE,It was supposed to be a surprise.,2
LORELAI,"Oh my God, this is amazing, Sookie, even for you.",2
SOOKIE,Wait 'til you see the ice sculptures!,2
LORELAI,When is it?,2
SOOKIE,Tonight.,2
LORELAI,"Uh, so your yen to hit the bingo parlor in Enfield was. . .",2
SOOKIE,A vicious vicious lie.,2
LORELAI,"This is incredible. This is really really incredible. My God, is there any pink icing left on the planet?",2
SOOKIE,The whole town is in on it actually. It's gonna be quite the affair. I think you'll be sufficiently impressed with the amount of people that wanna celebrate this with you.,2
LORELAI,Michel?,2
SOOKIE,No.,2
LORELAI,"Right. I, I just, I can't get over this. Ugh. Hey, you didn't by any chance invite my parents, did you?",2
SOOKIE,"Actually, I did.",2
LORELAI,Oh.,2
SOOKIE,"And at first, I was really torn because I know you have issues with them, but it is your wedding and I assumed you wanted them to be there. Oh no, your mother told you.",2
LORELAI,Sort of.,2
SOOKIE,"Damn, I thought I mentioned that it was a surprise. I don't know, maybe I didn't. It would be so typical of me. Uh, the cat's already out of the bag, and I'm stuffing imported chocolate squares down my shirt so you don't see me walk into the kitchen with them. Hey, did your mother mention if they were coming? She never got back to me.",2
LORELAI,"Uh, yeah, no, um, she's got a thing tonight.",2
SOOKIE,"Oh, too bad. Hey, we can save her a piece of cake.",2
LORELAI,,2
KIRK,"Attention guests, the buffet line is clogging at sector B. I repeat, sector B is moving too slow. Keep it moving people.",2
RORY,"Hey Mr. DJ, put a record on.",2
LANE,How's it sound?,2
RORY,Great.,2
LANE,"I'm trying to find that subtle blend between not too cliché sounding traditional tunes with out of left field, should be standard.",2
RORY,"Well, the Sinatra medley was great. I'd maybe skipped playing anything else by The Damned.",2
LANE,Got it. What time is it?,2
RORY,It's eight. What time do you leave?,2
LANE,I have a 10 o'clock flight.,2
RORY,Have I told you how much I'm gonna miss you?,2
LANE,Write me. Constantly.,2
RORY,Everyday.,2
LANE,Encouraging letters full of hope and see you soons.,2
RORY,I'll be tying yellow ribbons around the old oak trees.,2
LANE,I will be back for the wedding.,2
RORY,You better be.,2
LANE,Just don't let her change the date.,2
RORY,"Not going to happen. Max is teaching a summer course at the University of Toronto, so if you're back by the end of the summer , it'll be fine.",2
LANE,Don't say if.,2
RORY,Right.,2
MAX,"I don't know if you've realized, but every gift so far has been for you.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, well, in this town, I am the queen. You are simply my jester.",2
MAX,A position I happily accept.,2
LORELAI,"Aw, so come on then. How can you stand to leave all this for two months? Do you think Toronto's gonna make you into an ice sculpture? I don't think so.",2
MAX,I wish you'd come w ith me.,2
LORELAI,I have to work.,2
MAX,"Well, two months is a long time.",2
LORELAI,I know.,2
MAX,Will you still want me w hen I got back?,2
LORELAI,I think there's a very good possibility that I will be just as infatuated with you then as I am now.,2
MAX,Maybe more.,2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,"Oh, come on ladies, hurry up. Love waits for no one. Lucy, get off of Jenny's train! All right, bouquets up, and music!",2
RORY,How come you're not up there Kirk?,2
KIRK,"Oh, I don't tap anymore. Bum knees.",2
RORY,Ah.,2
KIRK,"I have to tell you, I'm a little worried about this gazebo holding up all those hoofers. They never did a trial run like I requested.",2
RORY,"Oh, I think it's okay. The studs are definitely sound, and the two by fours are a nice number two structural grade. Or better possibly. I built a house yesterday.",2
KIRK,"Oh, for Pete's sake! No tossing of the Jordan almonds. I repeat, put the almonds down!",2
DEAN,Hey.,2
RORY,Hey.,2
DEAN,This is quite a party.,2
RORY,"Elegant and understated, just like my mother.",2
DEAN,"So, uh, how are you?",2
RORY,"I'm fine, how are you?",2
DEAN,"Me? Uh, I'm an idiot.",2
RORY,No you're not.,2
DEAN,I'm so sorry Rory.,2
RORY,I'm sorry too.,2
DEAN,I don't even know what happened.,2
RORY,"We had a fight, that's all.",2
DEAN,"I mean, I've just missed you and ",2
RORY,I've missed you too.,2
DEAN,"I got I don't know, I got jealous of Harvard for a minute, which is crazy 'cause I love the fact that you're gonna go to Harvard. And then you have to do something that's gonna help you get there, and I I don't even, I don't even really understand it myself.",2
RORY,"Well, I didn't help. I was all wigged out when I got home.",2
DEAN,"Well, you had all the right to be.",2
RORY,"It's just that when it comes to Harvard, I sometimes get a little tunnel vision, and it's getting closer ",2
DEAN,Whoa.,2
RORY, and I have to think about it ,2
DEAN,You do not have to explain.,2
RORY,"But I don't want you to feel unimportant, because believe me, you're not.",2
DEAN,I'm glad.,2
RORY,I mean it. The only way you could be more important to me is if you had a Kit Kat bar growing out of your head.,2
DEAN,"Well, I can't make any promises, but I'll give it a try.",2
RORY,I'm sorry.,2
DEAN,"Don't be. I mean, I'm not going to a fancy school. I don't have that kind of pressure. I can't even imagine what that must feel like.",2
RORY,You could go to a fancy school if you wanted to.,2
DEAN,I don't think so.,2
RORY,Why not? You're smart.,2
DEAN,"No, you're smart.",2
RORY,You are too.,2
DEAN,Rory.,2
RORY,And I could help you organize all of your extracurricular activities because I'm now an expert at it.,2
DEAN,I don't ,2
RORY,How are your wilderness skills?,2
DEAN,Hey?,2
RORY,What?,2
DEAN,Do you accept my apology?,2
RORY,"Yeah, I accept your apology.",2
MAX,You okay?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah. You know, I'll just um, I'll be right back.",2
MAX,Okay.,2
KIRK,"Only three treats per person. No hogging of the treats. If caught with more than three treats on a plate, you will be faced with possible expulsion from said party.",2
LORELAI,Hey Kirk. Can I see that for a sec?,2
KIRK,"Oh, sure.",2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,Hey.,2
LUKE,Hey. Why aren't you at your party?,2
LORELAI,"Well that's funny, I was about to ask you the same thing.",2
LUKE,"Ah, well, I just got kinda busy here.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, yes, I can see that. Boy they keep making that ketchup slower and slower, huh?",2
LUKE,It's the Heinz family's little joke.,2
LORELAI,"Boy, it's really pretty crazy out there.",2
LUKE,"Oh, I can imagine.",2
LORELAI,"Lots of people all having fun, just the kind of thing you'd hate.",2
LUKE,Sounds awful,2
LORELAI,You'd be miserable.,2
LUKE,"Oh, yes I would.",2
LORELAI,"But in spite of all that, I was kind of thinking, and you don't have to, that maybe you could pull yourself away for a second.",2
LUKE,"Ah, well I ",2
LORELAI,"I mean, you know, finish the ketchup tonight, but maybe leave the worchestshire sauce for tomorrow.",2
LUKE,I'll see how it goes.,2
LORELAI,"Okay. I mean, it's just it's a really big night for me tonight, and I don't know, it just feels like you should be there. Anyway, I'll let you get back to your ketchup.",2
SOOKIE,The macaroons are going like hot cakes!,2
JACKSON,"Yup, everything's a big success.",2
SOOKIE,"Look at all this, isn't it beautiful? I know it's cliché, but it is so romantic it makes you all giddy in a really sappy kind of way, doesn't it?",2
JACKSON,"Uh, sure, I guess.",2
SOOKIE,"I hope they're happy. Ugh, what am I saying? How can they not be happy? They're in love, they have each other, and everything's perfect ",2
JACKSON,Okay! I get it!,2
SOOKIE,"Jackson, what are you ",2
JACKSON,What do you think I need a piano to fall on my head?,2
SOOKIE,"Well, I don't think anybody actually needs a piano to fall on their head.",2
JACKSON,"All the marriage talk, and the, 'Oh Jackson, you should see Lorelai's ring, it's so beautiful.'",2
SOOKIE,"Well, it is.",2
JACKSON,"I understand. I'm hip, okay? We've hit that point in our relationship where the little hints are starting. Which means that'll be followed by the 'where are we going' talk, and that'll only end in a big ultimatum. Suddenly all hell breaks loose.",2
SOOKIE,"Okay, no more sugar for you.",2
JACKSON,"So, I think I need to say this right now. I'm not ready for marriage.",2
SOOKIE,Okay.,2
JACKSON,"However, I'd be willing to move in.",2
SOOKIE,Move in where?,2
JACKSON,Move in with you.,2
SOOKIE,"Jackson, you're hilarious!",2
JACKSON,I am?,2
SOOKIE,I'll move in with you. What a riot!,2
JACKSON,Why are you laughing?,2
SOOKIE,"You're face! God, you're good. You are good.",2
JACKSON,,2
SOOKIE,"Come on, let's go get some punch.",2
JACKSON,"Sookie, I'm serious, I'm mo ving in.",2
SOOKIE,"Jackson, stop, you're gonna give me a cramp!",2
JACKSON,"Sookie, get back here! [pan around the party",2

EMILY,"Marina, the door please.",2
LORELAI,"Hey. Oh thanks. Hey mom. I was in the neighborhood, 'cause there's that wedding dress place on Willow. Elizabeth Taylor bought one of her dresses there. Anyhow, I was trying to make a decision about a veil, and I thought maybe you might have some opinion about which one would look best on me 'cause, well you know me, so um, I thought I'd stop by and ask you which one you thought would be good. On me. So, which one?",2
EMILY,You're quite capable of choosing that yourself Lorelai.,2
LORELAI,I'm sorry.,2
EMILY,"All right, you're sorry.",2
LORELAI,"I don't know how to tell you things Mom. Um, I don't know if you've noticed this or not, but we don't communicate very well. When something good happens to me, I'm just afraid you're gonna make me feel bad about it. And when something bad happens to me, I'm always afraid you'll say 'I told you so.' I'm not sure if that's always fair, and I'm sure I share part of the blame for this circle we get into, but you think your words don't have any effect on me, but they do. And, I just didn't want to feel bad about this, so I waited. And I really didn't mean to hurt you. Okay, well, I will let you get back to that letter there.",2
EMILY,Your head is much too big for a veil. You might consider a tiara.,2
LORELAI,"Um, a tiara?",2
EMILY,That's what I wore.,2

LORELAI,"Oh my God, here!",2
RORY,Wow.,2
LORELAI,"With a crunch and a zing and a hm hm hm hm, hello!",2
RORY,"Okay, our house is burning down, and you can save the cake or me. What do you choose?",2
LORELAI,Well that's not fair. The cake doesn't have legs.,2
FRAN,So how are we coming here?,2
LORELAI,"Oh Fran, so good. This cake is amazing.",2
RORY,Beyond amazing.,2
FRAN,"Well, I should hope so. We've been doing this for a 112 years.",2
LORELAI,"Huh. Well, you don't look a day over a 106.",2
FRAN,"No, I meant my family's been doing it for that long.",2
LORELAI,"Right. Okay, well, I'm glad we got that cleared up.",2
RORY,"The raspberry, the raspberry, the raspberry!",2
FRAN,"So, when is the big day again?",2
LORELAI,Two weeks from tomorrow.,2
FRAN,Have you picked a flavor?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, I don't know. They're all so good.",2
FRAN,Well you have to try them again.,2
Posted,10/27/01 20:16,2
LORELAI,Oh no. I've already eaten so many.,2
FRAN,"This is a very crucial decision, young lady. Cake is the glue of the wedding, so you will stand here and eat until you decide.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, if you insist.",2
FRAN,"I do. After all, what's more important then your wedding day?",2
LORELAI,"Well, it ain't Guy Fawkes day.",2
FRAN,"Yes, well, I'll just go and see if there's anything else in the back.",2
LORELAI,Thanks.,2
RORY,So how was in seeing Max last night?,2
LORELAI,Well ,2
RORY,No gory details.,2
LORELAI,Like I've ever shared that part of my relationship with you.,2
RORY,"You've alluded, you've insinuated, you have tiptoed to the brink of impropriety.",2
LORELAI,"Hm, that Chilton has taught you some big words.",2
RORY,That's kind of the point.,2
LORELAI,It was really great. I'm glad he's back.,2
RORY,And he's on board with the whole smallish wedding thing?,2
LORELAI,"Oh yeah. We want fun, we want simple, we want fast. We've been completely in sync, without the slightly gay boy band affiliation.",2
RORY,"Oh, I printed up some sample invitations for you. I made them on my computer",2
LORELAI,Aww.,2
RORY,"All you have to do is pick out a quote for the front page, and I'll print 'em up.",2
LORELAI,"Okay. Um  ""What is love? It is the morning and the evening star."" Ugh.",2
RORY,Sinclair Lewis.,2
LORELAI,Sinclair Sappy Lewis.,2
RORY,"Fine, next.",2
LORELAI,"""And all went merry as a marriage bell. But hush! Hark! A deep sound strikes like a rising knell!"" What is it with poetry?",2
RORY,Lord Byron.,2
LORELAI,"Byron and Lewis, together again.",2
RORY,"Okay, last one.",2
LORELAI,"""We have buried the putrid corpse of liberty."" Perfect!",2
RORY,"Mussolini it is. Um, can I ask you an ethical question?",2
LORELAI,Mmm.,2
RORY,Is it right to be sampling wedding cakes when Sookie's making ours for free?,2
LORELAI,"What is right anyway, you know? Who defines right? And if eating cake is wrong, I don't want to be right.",2
FRAN,I'm bringing out a mocha crunch cream.,2
LORELAI,"So, ethics?",2
RORY,Highly subjective and completely overrated.,2
LORELAI,,2
KIRK,And here's a sample of some of my black and white sh*ts.,2
MAX,Hm.,2
LORELAI,"Wow Kirk, I didn't know you were into photography.",2
KIRK,It's my passion.,2
LORELAI,Have you ever shot a wedding before?,2
KIRK,"Actually, this would be my first official wedding gig. Or photography gig, for that matter. But believe me, I've got the eye. And my Nikon is state of the art.",2
MAX,"Oh, I've got a Nikon too. It's an N64 with 3D matrix metering, 35 to 210 zoom. What have you got?",2
KIRK,It's a Nikon.,2
LORELAI,"I gotta tell you Kirk, these are really good for amateur sh*ts.",2
KIRK,Thanks. That's me an d my parents on vacation in the Berkshires.,2
MAX,"Hm, nice looking family.",2
KIRK,And those are some self-portraits.,2
LORELAI,"Aahh! Kirk, you're nude!",2
KIRK,"No no, I'm wearing Speedos. They're kind of flesh colored.",2
MAX,Wait a minute. I recognize this.,2
KIRK,"Nice photo, huh?",2
MAX,"This is VJ Day, New York, 1945.",2
KIRK,Right. I include it as an example of the excellence that I aspire to.,2
LORELAI,How much for your services?,2
KIRK,How about a hundred and fifty an hour?,2
LORELAI,How about lunch and the cost of the film?,2
KIRK,You won't be sorry.,2
LORELAI,Done.,2
KIRK,I thank you.,2
LORELAI,Bye.,2
MAX,"Oh, uh, what time is it?",2
LORELAI,Ten ,2
MAX,Ten of?,2
LORELAI,Three.,2
MAX,I have to go.,2
LORELAI,No!,2
MAX,I have to.,2
LORELAI,You're always going.,2
MAX,"Well, luckily that'll all change soon.",2
LORELAI,Yes it will. Two weeks from now you won't have to get going 'cause it's here you'll be going. To. Going or going to?,2
MAX,I'd add the to.,2
LORELAI,Hm. Going to. You make me smarter.,2
MAX,"Hm, well, I am a teacher.",2
LORELAI,"Hey, hey, don't. Stay longer.",2
MAX,I can't.,2
LORELAI,Take me upstairs and see if you can get me into Mensa.,2
MAX,"It's gonna take me forever to get back into the city, and I gotta get up early to let the painters in.",2
LORELAI,"Hey, do you have to be there while they work?",2
MAX,What do you mean?,2
LORELAI,"Well, isn't your apartment gonna be all paint fumey?",2
MAX,"Yeah, so?",2
LORELAI,"So, maybe you should stay here.",2
MAX,Here?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah. Instead of driving back and forth all weekend, sleep over. I mean, it's gonna be your place too soon enough. Look at it like a trial run.",2
MAX,A trial run.,2
LORELAI,It'll be fun.,2
MAX,You think you're ready for me?,2
LORELAI,I'm always ready for you.,2
MAX,Full time?,2
LORELAI,I insist.,2
MAX,He was not wearing Speedos.,2
LORELAI,"Ugh, don't talk about the photo.",2
MAX,The man was buck naked.,2
LORELAI,Offer rescinded if this line of conversation proceeds.,2
MAX,I'll be back.,2
LORELAI,,2
DEAN,"So, what are we doing tonight?",2
RORY,I'll do whatever.,2
DEAN,"Well, what movies haven't we seen?",2
RORY,We haven't seen just about all of them.,2
DEAN,"Yeah, they all stink this year.",2
RORY,They definitely do underestimate our intelligence.,2
DEAN,Plus they stink.,2
RORY,There are at least five of them featuring someone doing something disgusting with a cow.,2
DEAN,"Yeah. I mean, they should at least do something disgusting with a different animal.",2
RORY,"We can watch ""Holy Grail"" on tape again.",2
DEAN,"Okay, but I am not talking in an English accent for the rest of the evening.",2
RORY,"No fun. Hey, tomorrow night?",2
DEAN,"""Life of Brian?""",2
RORY,Max is staying over.,2
DEAN,Really?,2
RORY,"First time. And to kind of celebrate, he and my mom wanted to go on a double date.",2
DEAN,But tomorrow's our anniversary.,2
RORY,"No it's not, it's on the twenty-fourth.",2
DEAN,"No, that was our old anniversary. We broke up and got back together on the sixth. So using the twenty-fourth wouldn't be an accurate account of how long we've been together.",2
RORY,"Unless you consider our time ap art as a temporary moratorium on our relationship. You know, like the time kept passing, and we were on a sabbatical.",2
DEAN,"Yeah, it's complicated.",2
RORY,Very.,2
DEAN,"So a double date, with adults?",2
RORY,"No, just with Mom and Max.",2
DEAN,"What'll it be, like dinner and dancing?",2
RORY,"Yes, and then we'll enjoy brandy and cigars. No, we'll probably just grab a bite.",2
DEAN,"All right, we can do that.",2
RORY,"Hey, let's have two anniversaries. We can celebrate twice a month. They're well spread apart, the sixth and the twenty-fourth.",2
DEAN,We can't do that.,2
RORY,Who's gonna stop us?,2
DEAN,Twice a month?,2
RORY,Dare to be different.,2
DEAN,,2
LORELAI,Why won't you let me help?,2
MAX,Because you're a danger to the process.,2
LORELAI,That's not true!,2
MAX,I've got numerous scars.,2
LORELAI,"I cut you that one two times, and I've helped you tons of times.",2
MAX,You helped me twice and both time you cut me.,2
LORELAI,"Well, I do like watching you cook.",2
MAX,I like you watching me cook.,2
RORY,What's that weird smell?,2
LORELAI,It's food!,2
MAX,It smells weird?,2
RORY,"No, just weird for this house. It smells great.",2
MAX,"Rory, could you get that?",2
RORY,What?,2
MAX,"Uh, right down there. Uh, shiny handle.",2
LORELAI,Ugh! Did you know we had that?,2
RORY,Not a clue.,2
MAX,Oh come on.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, it's on fire!",2
MAX,It's the broiler.,2
RORY,Wow.,2
MAX,What fallout shelter have you guys been living in?,2
RORY,He has much knowledge.,2
LORELAI,We shall form a cult around him.,2
RORY,Build a statue many stories high.,2
LORELAI,We shall grow our hair long and stop bathing.,2
MAX,"Please, don't do any of that.",2
RORY,Are we eating at the table?,2
MAX,Wherever you want.,2
LORELAI,TV?,2
RORY,I'll get a tape.,2
LORELAI,Can I at least grab some dishes?,2
MAX,Far away from me.,2
LORELAI,,2
TV,'You don't learn very fast Injun.',2
LORELAI,How fast do you learn Billy Jack?,2
TV,'Fast enough.',2
RORY,"Billy Jack, I'm gonna k*ll you if it's the last thing I do.",2
LORELAI,"Ugh, he so jinxed himself with that one.",2
RORY,"Yeah, he should've said 'Billy Jack, I'm gonna k*ll you or buy myself a lovely chenille sweater.'",2
LORELAI,"Ooh, yeah, either way he wins.",2
MAX,How many times have you seen this movie?,2
LORELAI,I'm out of digits.,2
RORY,You can't see a Billy Jack movie too many times.,2
MAX,Who's the guy Billy Jack's. . .,2
LORELAI,Shh shh shh!,2
TV,'All right you cats. Very slowly now.',2
LORELAI,Let's do some jumping jacks.,2
TV,'Spread out. One.',2
RORY,Oh it's the counting part.,2
TV,'He means it Daniel.' 'Two.',2
LORELAI,"Ooh, here comes my favorite and my least favorite line all rolled into one.",2
TV,'I'm gonna cut your bowels out.',2
LORELAI,Ughughugh.,2
RORY,"Ahh, yuck!",2
TV,'Three.',2
LORELAI,"Ooh, comeuppance time!",2
MAX,"You guys talk throughout the whole movie and then when I say something, you shush me.",2
LORELAI,"That's because you're talking through parts we talked through last time, so we haven't seen those parts in awhile.",2
MAX,"Ah, well now it's clear.",2
LORELAI,Max?,2
MAX,What? The phone?,2
LORELAI,Whoever's closest answers.,2
RORY,House rule.,2
MAX,You're both closer.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, but I'd have to walk around the coffee table so my path would be farther.",2
RORY,And my foot's asleep.,2
LORELAI,Plus you're taller.,2
RORY,With longer legs.,2
LORELAI,"Yes, so even if we all left for the phone at exactly the same time ",2
MAX,I got it.,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,You want a refill?,2
RORY,"Sure, same thing.",2
LORELAI,Max?,2
RORY,Uh oh.,2
LORELAI,We wore him out.,2
RORY,We tend to do that.,2
LORELAI,"Well, we are ElectraWoman and DynaGirl.",2
MAX,ElectraWoman.,2
RORY,I think it's time to turn in.,2
LORELAI,Yeah.,2
MAX,I'm awake.,2
RORY,You don't look it.,2
MAX,"No, I am. I'm just waiting for the guy with the thing on the ",2
RORY,"Mom, get him to bed.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, okay. Come on hon.",2
MAX,What happened to Billy Jack?,2
LORELAI,I'll explain it to you later.,2
RORY,Goodnight.,2
LORELAI,Goodnight.,2
MAX,Goodnight.,2
LORELAI,Is this weird?,2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,Hey.,2
RORY,What? What is it?,2
LORELAI,Oh nothing. Whatcha doing?,2
RORY,Taking back Poland.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, good luck with that.",2
RORY,Mom.,2
LORELAI,I have a boy in my room,2
RORY,So?,2
LORELAI,So I have a boy in my room.,2
RORY,It's Max.,2
LORELAI,I know.,2
RORY,You like Max.,2
LORELAI,"No, uhh, yes, I do, but it's weird. We've never had a man in the house like this up there.",2
RORY,He's your fiancé.,2
LORELAI,Very true.,2
RORY,So all you need to do is adjust. It's like that time you got the green stripes in your hair.,2
LORELAI,I hated those green stripes.,2
RORY,"Well, I'm tired. I can think of a better example tomorrow.",2
LORELAI,"No, wake up, wake up. We've not properly talked about this.",2
RORY,About what?,2
LORELAI,About having Max in the house. About the effect on you. Don't cover up anything. Let's get it all out in the open.,2
RORY,I don't have anything to cover up. I like Max.,2
LORELAI,"I know you do, and that's good. But you know, once we are married, nothing will ever be the same ag ain.",2
RORY,I know.,2
LORELAI,It won't just be the 'me an d you secret special clubhouse no boys allowed' thing anymore.,2
RORY,It will be different.,2
LORELAI,Not just different. Our lives as we know them will be over.,2
RORY,"Mom, we're not dying.",2
LORELAI,"No, we're not dying. But the life we had is gonna morph into this like mutation that we could never possibly have conceived.",2
RORY,"Like the giant ants in ""Them""?",2
LORELAI,"Metaphorically speaking, yes. And I don't want it to be like giant ants, so that's why I'm talking about it now.",2
RORY,I am in no way anticipating being att*cked by giant man-eating ants because Max is living here.,2
LORELAI,Good. Good.,2
RORY,Weirdo.,2
LORELAI,"You know, you can't walk around in the buff anymore.",2
RORY,I don't rememb er ever walking around in the buff.,2
LORELAI,I know one time you did.,2
RORY,Was I three?,2
LORELAI,Somewhere around there.,2
RORY,Does he hog the bed?,2
LORELAI,No. He's a very 'stay on his side' kinda guy.,2
RORY,Good.,2
LORELAI,He's cute. He wears pajama bottoms.,2
RORY,Stop.,2
LORELAI,Not funny ones. I hate funny bottoms.,2
RORY,I'm gonna call you Funny Bottoms from now on.,2
LORELAI,Nuh uh!,2
RORY,Aren't you happy?,2
LORELAI,Yes. I'm happy.,2
RORY,"Well, then it'll be fine. You'll get used to it, having Max there.",2
LORELAI,I know. You're right. I will. I will get used to it.,2
RORY,Mom.,2
LORELAI,Hm?,2
RORY,You're falling asleep.,2
LORELAI,So?,2
RORY,You need to be a big girl and go to your own room.,2
LORELAI,"Okay. Uh, uh...",2
RORY,"Fine, ten more minutes",2
LORELAI,,2
LUKE,More?,2
TAYLORory,Absotivalutely.,2
LUKE,What's up Taylor?,2
TAYLORory,"Up, I know of nothing up.",2
LUKE,What's up Taylor?,2
TAYLORory,I'm just happy.,2
LUKE,That's what makes me nervous.,2
TAYLORory,You're a paranoid man Luke. I feel very sad for you.,2
LUKE,Over there.,2
LORELAI,"Uh, can you clear that one off?",2
LUKE,Why?,2
LORELAI,'Cause it's bigger.,2
LUKE,So.,2
LORELAI,"Well, we're three today.",2
LUKE,Three?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, Max is with us.",2
LUKE,"Max, huh? So when did Max become invisible to the human eye?",2
LORELAI,He's on a paper hunt.,2
RORY,"Max likes his three papers in the morning. The Hartford Courant, the New York Times, and the Wall Street Journal.",2
LUKE,Three papers.,2
LORELAI,He likes to be well informed.,2
LUKE,"Yeah, well, reading three papers all reporting the same news is a terrific use of trees.",2
LORELAI,"You be nice Luke, I mean it.",2
MAX,Hey there.,2
LUKE,"Max, buddy, top of the morning to you! Hey, you look good today. Brown is your color, my friend.",2
MAX,Thanks.,2
LORELAI,So?,2
MAX,I got two out of three.,2
RORY,Not bad,2
MAX,No one has the Wall Street Journal.,2
RORY,Well this isn't a very financially oriented town.,2
LORELAI,"Yes, it's more oriented to coffee.",2
LUKE,I've got the blueberry pancakes this morning.,2
LORELAI,Bring 'em.,2
RORY,Bring 'em twice.,2
LUKE,And you?,2
MAX,I'm gonna need a minute.,2
LORELAI,"Oh. Well, then, hold off.",2
RORY,Same here.,2
LUKE,I might run out of the pancakes.,2
MAX,"Go ahead, order. I'll just be a minute.",2
LORELAI,No that's okay. We'll wait.,2
LUKE,I'm almost out and I can't make more.,2
LORELAI,Set some as ide.,2
LUKE,"It's first come, first serve.",2
RORY,We'll take our chances.,2
LORELAI,"Yes, we'll wait.",2
LUKE,Whatever.,2
MAX,You didn't need to do that.,2
LORELAI,"Aww, happy to.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, yeah, that's still eggs and all your basic breakfast stuff up there.",2
MAX,Just order.,2
RORY,We're fine.,2
MAX,I want you guys to go at your normal pace. My rhythm might not necessarily be your rhythm. What's this?,2
LUKE,It's the lunch menu. I stop serving breakfast in an hour.,2
LORELAI,Luke.,2
MAX,I'll have poached eggs.,2
LORELAI,And blueberry pancakes!,2
RORY,Did we make it?!,2
LUKE,I already set 'em aside.,2
LORELAI,Love ya!,2
LUKE,What the hell they doing out there?,2
TAYLORory,What? Who is that?,2
LUKE,What are they doing Taylor?,2
TAYLORory,Looks like they're coning off the street.,2
LUKE,Taylor.,2
TAYLORory,"Well, if you must know, they are a county work crew here to install Stars Hollow's first traffic light and metered crosswalk. Luke!",2
LUKE,Hold it!,2
TAYLORory,Keep going. You have no controlling legal authority over this matter.,2
LUKE,Stuff it Taylor. Hold it!,2
TAYLORory,Keep going. And I will not stuff it.,2
LUKE,"What authority did you have to authorize this? You're supposed to inform local business owners of major projects per the town's rules, meaning me.",2
TAYLORory,"Not when it's a matter of dire public safety, where the city charter clearly states that I canfunction unilaterally in the town's best interest.",2
LUKE,Dire public safety! We haven't had an accident here in ten years!,2
TAYLORory,You can't stop progress Luke.,2
LORELAI,"Traffic light, huh?",2
LUKE,It's unbelievable.,2
LORELAI,"Well, it can always be taken out with your bare hands or your teeth.",2
LUKE,"Yeah, I guess.",2
LORELAI,"Hey, did you get my invitation?",2
LUKE,The what?,2
LORELAI,My wedding invitation for my wedding 'cause I'm wedding Max.,2
LUKE,"Oh yeah, yeah. It's in a pile upstairs somewhere.",2
LORELAI,"Good, good. So are you coming?",2
LUKE,"You know, I gotta make some calls about this thing before it's too late. I'll see you later.",2
LORELAI,,2
MAX,"Ugh, I can barely walk.",2
LORELAI,Bad shoes?,2
MAX,I ate a cow.,2
LORELAI,You had a steak.,2
MAX,"Plus the sides. Four people, six baked potatoes.",2
LORELAI,"Uh, you always exaggerate.",2
MAX,Am I exaggerating?,2
DEAN,Nope.,2
RORY,"Ooh, ice cream!",2
LORELAI,"Ooh, I'm right behind you!",2
MAX,How can they possibly eat more?,2
DEAN,Kind of surprised.,2
MAX,I know. They're bottomless pits.,2
DEAN,I mean at you. You've known them long enough not to be so confused.,2
MAX,"Oh, I'm not confused. I'm just . . . what do you mean?",2
DEAN,Their eating habits are just the start of what you're gonna have to get used to. There's tons of stuff you should be aware of.,2
MAX,Really?,2
DEAN,"Oh yeah. Like, don't ever use the last of the parmesan cheese. And never get into a heavy discussion late at night 'cause that's when they're at their crankiest. Oh, and uh, go with their bits.",2
MAX,Their bits?,2
DEAN,"Yeah, like, if you're eating pizza with them and Lorelai decides that the pepperoni is angry at the mushrooms because the mushrooms have an attitude and then she holds up a pepperoni and the pepperoni asks for your opinion...don't just laugh. Answer the pepperoni.",2
MAX,Answer the pepperoni.,2
DEAN,And don't let them near puppies 'cause they'll want to take home every one.,2
MAX,"Oh, that one I knew.",2
DEAN,"Oh, and uh, here's a big one. If you ever think that they're doing something crazy, they're not. You see, after a while, their thinking becomes clear, but by the time it's clear, they've already done two other totally crazy things that you can't figure out. So there's no catching up.",2
MAX,You have much knowledge.,2
DEAN,You got that from Rory.,2
MAX,Right.,2
DEAN,"Oh, and hey, does Lorelai know what kind of ice cream you like?",2
MAX,"Yeah, chocolate chip. But I already told her that I ",2
LORELAI,"Hey, chocolate chip.",2
MAX,Thanks.,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,"Ugh, I'm so full. Why'd you let me eat so much?",2
DEAN,"Yeah, they'll blame you.",2
MAX,It's past eleven guys.,2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,Mm.,2
MAX,How ya doing?,2
LORELAI,"Mm, I'm stable.",2
MAX,You're a lovely shade of puce.,2
LORELAI,Don't say puce. It sounds too much like another word I don't wanna hear right now.,2
MAX,Sorry. You know they're still outside.,2
LORELAI,Who?,2
MAX,Rory and Dean.,2
LORELAI,Oh.,2
MAX,How long you think they'll be out there?,2
LORELAI,I don't know.,2
MAX,So there's no time limit or anything?,2
LORELAI,"Yes. As soon as they both get tired of saying 'No, you're prettier' to each other, then the night's over.",2
MAX,"Lorelai, come on.",2
LORELAI,What?,2
MAX,"Well, I'm gonna be living here soon.",2
LORELAI,I know that.,2
MAX,So I just thought I should know what the procedure is when stuff like this comes up.,2
LORELAI,Stuff like what?,2
MAX,"Say you're not here, I come home, there's Rory and Dean in the dark all alone after eleven. I mean, how do I handle stuff like that?",2
LORELAI,"Oh, Max, Rory is very low maintenance. Kind of like that robot kid in A.I., only way less mother-obsessed. Oh my God, that kid was so annoying. I would've pushed him out of the car while it was still moving.",2
MAX,"Well, what if I catch them one night making out on the couch?",2
LORELAI,"Umm well, turn off the light?",2
MAX,You're not being serious.,2
LORELAI,"Max, they're teenagers. They can kiss a little bit.",2
MAX,"Okay, well, what do I do if Rory comes home drunk?",2
LORELAI,Come on!,2
MAX,It happens.,2
LORELAI,Not to Rory it doesn't.,2
MAX,"I know. But theoretically, just in a make believe world, if she did, what would I do?",2
LORELAI,Nothing.,2
MAX,Excuse me?,2
LORELAI,"No, you would do nothing. I would handle it.",2
MAX,"So basically, I have no role in Rory's life.",2
LORELAI,"Max, Rory's done. She's brought up, she's Rory. You don't need a role.",2
MAX,Fine.,2
LORELAI,I don't see the problem here.,2
MAX,"Clearly. So, I should do nothing around here ever.",2
LORELAI,"No, not nothing ever.",2
MAX,What then?,2
LORELAI,"Well, making the garlic bread the other night was really good.",2
MAX,"So other than making the garlic bread and answering the phone, what else is my role around here?",2
LORELAI,"Well, you're my fella. You're my guy, you're my old man.",2
MAX,What does that entail?,2
LORELAI,All things dirty.,2
MAX,I'm not joking here. We're getting married Lorelai.,2
LORELAI,I know.,2
MAX,"Well, that means we're taking two separate lives and melding them together. I mean, how do you think that's gonna work?",2
LORELAI,I don't know.,2
MAX,"Well, have you given it any thought at all?",2
LORELAI,"Not really. No, I I mean, but I will! But I I'll start now.",2
MAX,How would you feel if I told you I haven't thought about our future at all?,2
LORELAI,"Terrible, I would feel terrible, I'm sorry. I mean it, I'm sorry. Please come here. Rememb er, it's all those little annoying quirks that make me the fascinating woman you fell in love with. Hmm?",2
MAX,Really not fair.,2
LORELAI,"I've got a lingerie drawer full of not fair, mister.",2
MAX,"Okay. I mean, we didn't need to get into this tonight. I definitely broke Dean's late night cranky rule.",2
LORELAI,Who's what?,2
MAX,,2
TAYLORory,"Welcome townspeople! I  So you're gonna spoil it for all of us right off the bat, huh Luke?",2
LUKE,Why waste time?,2
SOOKIE,What about dinner?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, you don't eat dinner at a bachelorette party.",2
SOOKIE,You gotta eat.,2
LORELAI,"No, you gotta drink, dance, party and drink some more.",2
SOOKIE,We'll all hurl before the night's half over.,2
TAYLORory,This is all very fascinating.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, sorry Teach. We'll keep it down.",2
TAYLORory,How about keeping it silent?,2
LORELAI,Way down.,2
TAYLORory,Or zipping it shut?,2
LORELAI,Little tiny mice voices.,2
TAYLORory,"Townspeople, we should all be proud of the new addition to our streets. I know many of you have wanted a traffic light and a crosswalk for many years ",2
LUKE,What?,2
TAYLORory," and now, your dream has come true.",2
LUKE,It's like Hitler's Germany.,2
TAYLORory,Luke!,2
LUKE,"You're trying to brainwash us, Taylor. Telling us we want something that we don't and not giving us any choice.",2
LORELAI,"Luke, shish! We're planning.",2
LUKE,"I heard, and you're idiots if you don't eat first.",2
TAYLORory,,2
PATTY,Oh my God. That's the biggest yellow button I've ever seen.,2
TAYLORory,,2
PATTY,"'To cross street, push yellow button, wait for walk signal. When signal reads walk, step into street and proceed to the other side.'",2
LUKE,It's written for morons.,2
BABETTE,In big stupid letters too!,2
MOREY,I hate being infantalized.,2
TAYLORory,Does no one here care about this fate of near accidents we have suffered over the past year?,2
LUKE,Near accidents. Meaning they didn't happen.,2
TAYLORory,Just because they didn't happen doesn't mean that we shouldn't ward against them.,2
LUKE,There's lots of things that don't happen that we don't ward against.,2
TAYLORory,Like?,2
LUKE,Like everything.,2
TAYLORory,"So that everything doesn't happen here, meaning nothing happens?",2
LUKE,"No, it's not nothing happens. Stuff happens. It's that it it's not everything that's it's Dammit Taylor!",2
TAYLORory,"Ha! Now, for some in teresting stats ",2
LORELAI,"So let's see. That's you, me, Miss Patty, Rory, Babette. Babette, you're coming right?",2
BABETTE,"Doll, I'm sorry. I'm not gonna be able to make it.",2
LORELAI,"Babette, no.",2
BABETTE,"We're having Morey's parents over for dinner, and if you cancel on 'em last minute, they'll stick a red-hot poker up your 'you know where'.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, well, we'll miss you.",2
BABETTE,"Yeah, well stick your hand down the front of some guy's pants for me, would ya?",2
LORELAI,I hope you're talking about a stripper.,2
BABETTE,Whatever.,2
TAYLORory," Now the length of the walk signal's duration has thoughtfully been timed to accommodate the pace of Stars Hollow's oldest living resident. So, to inaugurate the signal, our beloved Mrs. Lanahan is going to push the button and lead the first historic group across the street. Ready with the camera Kirk?",2
KIRK,,2
PATTY,"Uh, the cap is still on the lens, dear.",2
KIRK,Oh thanks.,2
LORELAI,I'm not wearing a veil at the party.,2
SOOKIE,But the bride always wears a veil at the bachelorette party.,2
LORELAI,I'm not wearing a veil at the wedding.,2
SOOKIE,You're not? I love veils!,2
LORELAI,"Nah, we're going cas Sook.",2
SOOKIE,"But it's a big day, you gotta have some pomp.",2
LUKE,You should elope and get it over with.,2
SOOKIE,No one asked you.,2
LORELAI,"Believe me, eloping was not out of the question.",2
SOOKIE,But you don't get a wedding over with.,2
LUKE,"Why not? It's a bureaucratic civil ceremony, a pretty pointless one.",2
SOOKIE,Agh! Don't listen to him.,2
LORELAI,"Ah, he's just being Luke",2
LUKE,"It's not biologically natural for people to mate for life. Animals don't mate for life. Well, ducks do, but who the hell cares what ducks do?",2
LORELAI,Luke.,2
LUKE,"I mean, people grow and evolve their whole lives. The chances that you're gonna grow and evolve at the same rate as someone else...too slim to take. The minute you say 'I do', you're sticking yourself in a tiny little box for the rest of your life. But hey, at least you had a party first, right?",2
SOOKIE,,2
PATTY,"Oh, this place looks like fun!",2
RORY,They're never gonna let me in .,2
LORELAI,They will let you in.,2
MICHELorelai,"This is a felony, you know, corrupting a minor. We'll all end up in the bookie.",2
RORY,He's right. We're all going to the bookie.,2
LORELAI,"Sweetie, don't say bookie. It's creepy.",2
SOOKIE,Just try to look older.,2
RORY,How?,2
SOOKIE,Look like you're thinking about retirements or 401Ks and stuff.,2
MICHELorelai,"Yes, you should've brought your fake beard and mustache.",2
LORELAI,Who invited Mister Schnickelfritz?,2
SOOKIE,He heard us planning and wanted to come.,2
MICHELorelai,I did not know the evening included babysitting.,2
LORELAI,She's going to get in. Sorry. Hey!,2
MAX,So my bachelor party's come to a screeching halt.,2
LORELAI,What? Why?,2
MAX,"There's been an accident. I'm fine, but we're at the hospital.",2
LORELAI,"Oh my God, what happened?",2
MAX,We're coming out of the restaurant and we're heading toward our next stop when my brother decides to leap frog over a parking meter.,2
LORELAI,Why did he do that?,2
MAX,Middle child.,2
LORELAI,Poor Jan.,2
MAX,"Anyway, he didn't make it.",2
LORELAI,Ugh. Ouch. How drunk was he?,2
MAX,He claims he wasn't drunk. He's saying that the parking meters in Hartford are taller then the parking meters in Deluth so he just miscalculated.,2
LORELAI,Huh.,2
MAX,Yup. MAX'S,2
BROTHERory,I've got a concussion. I'm good. Let's drink.,2
MAX,Hold on a second. You got a concussion? MAX'S,2
BROTHERory,"Yeah, it's a little one ",2
LORELAI,What is he saying?,2
MAX,It's a mild concussion. We're gonna take him home.,2
LORELAI,"All right, well take him home, and then go hit a strip club.",2
MAX,Excuse me?,2
LORELAI,"I am telling you, this is your last chance to look at another woman's breastage.",2
MAX,Point well taken. I'll call you tomorrow.,2
SOOKIE,"Okay, new rule for the evening. No calls to fiancés or boyfriends or anything else like that. It's girls' night out. Plus Michel.",2
LORELAI,Hey.,2
BOUNCERory,It's twelve bucks. And it's eighteen and over.,2
SOOKIE,"Oh, she's eighteen.",2
RORY,"That's right. Last week. So it's a new eighteen, but it's eighteen, yup.",2
BOUNCERory,You got some ID?,2
LORELAI,"Hey, uh, sir, make way for Rory. That's her name. And her only name. Rory. Single name, she's that important. Internationally known international supermodel and sometimes spokesperson for international products.",2
SOOKIE,She's very big in Germany.,2
LORELAI,"Yah, yah, yah, with the leichter hosen and such.",2
BOUNCERory,Twelve bucks.,2
LORELAI,Thank you.,2
SOOKIE,,2
MICHELorelai,This is a drag club.,2
SOOKIE,"It's called the Queen Victoria. What did you expect, tea and crumpets?",2
LORELAI,"Aw, you guys, I guess we're gonna have to stand.",2
SOOKIE,"Wait, that one looks open.",2
LORELAI,Oh.,2
SOOKIE,Oh my God.,2
LORELAI,What in Lucifer's reach is my mother doing here?,2
MICHELorelai,"Oh, I invited her.",2
LORELAI,You what?,2
MICHELorelai,Just a little surprise for you. I thought it would be a kick.,2
LORELAI,"Excuse me sir, you look just like my mother.",2
RORY,Hi Grandma. Come here often?,2
EMILY,I should say not. How did you get in?,2
RORY,"Oh, apparently, I'm an internationally known supermodel.",2
EMILY,"Happy bachelorette party, Lorelai.",2
LORELAI,Thank you Mother.,2
EMILY,"And in the future, when you plan one of these things, and you tell a person to show up at eight o'clock, it is considered good manners for you to also show up at eight o'clock.",2
LORELAI,"Well, I didn't exactly invite you mother, Michel did.",2
EMILY,"Ah, well, I feel much better now.",2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,Looks like Emily's gotten a head start. What are you drinking honey?,2
EMILY,Manhattan. Good too. Not too sweet. I ordered it from that nice fellow dressed as Joan Crawford.,2
MICHELorelai,"So, is there no dancing here? I was hoping there'd be dancing.",2
SOOKIE,You need to strut Tony Minero?,2
MICHELorelai,"It is a weekend and on the weekend I like to move, and the ladies, they like it too.",2
LORELAI,Especially when you move out of town. Ba zing!,2
EMILY,Has she eaten?,2
SOOKIE,Yeah. About a quart of wine.,2
LORELAI,"Hmm, hi Mae West.",2
WAITRESS,What can I get for you?,2
MICHELorelai,My dignity back.,2
LORELAI,"We'll have a rum and coke, a margarita no salt, martini with olives, a Shirley Temple ",2
WAITRESS,Love her!,2
RORY,I'll have her on the rocks please.,2
LORELAI,"And uh, I will have a giant Long Island iced tea.",2
WAITRESS,Coming up.,2
EMILY,"So Lorelai, how are you feeling?",2
LORELAI,"Um, well, I'm tipsy, but just short of seeing pink elephants.",2
EMILY,"No, I mean about you getting married. It's only a week away.",2
LORELAI,"I'm fine. Everything's fine. I figured once I got the shoes to match the dress, the rest was just gravy.",2
EMILY,,2
PATTY,"So was I, before all of mine.",2
SOOKIE,,2
PATTY,"Well, uh, there was Sinjin, John, Sergio, Sinjin. Three men, four times.",2
SOOKIE,,2
PATTY,"Well, Sinjin was a let down the second time, but he was my Burton and I was his Taylor. Just wish I could've found a little Mike Todd there in the middle.",2
EMILY,"You know, I can't believe it was 34 years ago that I married Richard. I remember it so distinctly.",2
SOOKIE,"Ooh, this is gonna be a romantic story.",2
EMILY,"My stomach was not my friend. It was full of butterflies, I couldn't eat a bite the whole week.",2
LORELAI,"Hmm, what a bummer .",2
EMILY,"I was actually weak in the knees. Trembling all the time, can you imagine?",2
RORY,Really?,2
EMILY,"When I wasn't actually with Richard, I was thinking about him. Constantly. Imagining what he was doing, was he thinking about me? Making up little scenarios in my head about how we'd run into each other accidentally at the club. And he would be playing golf and I would walk by and he would be so distracted that he'd completely miss the ball. Silly.",2
SOOKIE,It's sweet.,2
EMILY,I was in love,2
MICHELorelai,It is wonderful to be in love,2
EMILY,"But the thing I rememb er most was that for the entire week before my wedding, I'd wait 'til my mother went to sleep, and I'd sneak out of bed and I'd put on my wedding dress and my tiara and my gloves, and I would stare at myself in the mirror and think how very safe I felt. How very right and wise and honored. This is a very good drink. I highly recommend it.",2
SOOKIE,,2
PATTY,Are you calling Jackson?,2
SOOKIE,"No. Well yes, but it's only because I need to pick up something I left at his house, that if it's still there, I should. . .hi honey, it's me.",2
EMILY,And who are you writing to?,2
RORY,I just want to see if Dean's around.,2
EMILY,,2
PATTY,"Oh no, not you too.",2
LORELAI,"No, it's just..it's I'll be quick. Hi.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Hi. Who's this?,2
LORELAI,It's Trixie from the other night. You never called me.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Lorelai?,2
LORELAI,"Uh, you got me. Whatcha doing?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,I'm just hanging out. What are you doing?,2
LORELAI,I'm at a bachelorette party.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Oh cool. Who's?,2
LORELAI,Mine.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Yours? Wow.,2
LORELAI,I know. I'm still kinda 'wow' about it myself.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Well who's the lucky guy?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, you don't know him. His name's Max.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Right. Max.,2
LORELAI,You do know him?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Uh, Rory mentioned him. She didn't mention it was serious.",2
LORELAI,"Well, it wasn't. We hooked up, and then it was going good, then we broke up 'cause one of us kinda freaked out ",2
CHRISTOPHERory,You freaked out.,2
LORELAI,I freaked out. And then we got back together and it suddenly got very serious.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,So is he worthy?,2
LORELAI,Is anyone?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Bono, maybe? Brian Ferry?",2
LORELAI,Get serious.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,A young Tom Waits?,2
LORELAI,Now you're talking.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,So what's he like?,2
LORELAI,He's great.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Could you be a little more vague?,2
LORELAI,I don't know. He's Max. He's great.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, what's his CD collection like?",2
LORELAI,Don't read into his CD collection.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Jazz, classical, what's the story?",2
LORELAI,It's a kind of a general collection.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Uh oh.,2
LORELAI,"Uh, Christopher.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Are we talking a dozen soundtracks, a few Beatles, a Bob Dylan, plus a generic fifty?",2
LORELAI,I said don't.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Alanis Morissette?,2
LORELAI,"Hey, a lot of people knee-jerked and bought that first one of hers. Cut him some slack.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Dave Matthews?,2
LORELAI,A couple of his things are good.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Buena Vista Social Club?,2
LORELAI,Stop it.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Enya?,2
LORELAI,I'm gonna hit you.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,We're on the phone.,2
LORELAI,I'm gonna come over there and hit you.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,You're at your bachelorette party.,2
LORELAI,Right. Right.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,So why are you calling me?,2
LORELAI,"Um, because you know me really well.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Yes I do.,2
LORELAI,And I just wanted to tell someone who knows me really well that I am getting married.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, as someone who knows you really well, I say congratulations. If you found the guy, I think that's great.",2
LORELAI,"And you can picture me mar ried, right?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Yeah. To the right guy, I can picture you married.",2
LORELAI,Thanks.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,You should get back to your party.,2
LORELAI,"Right, right. He's a great guy, Max.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Yeah, I'm sure he is. I was just kidding around.",2
LORELAI,"I know. Well, I'll talk to you later.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Bye. Hey, can you put Trixie back on the phone?",2
LORELAI,Bye.,2
LORELAI,Hey.,2
RORY,Hey.,2
LORELAI,Michel leave?,2
SOOKIE,Nope. He said he had to shake his thing. So how's your guy?,2
LORELAI,Hmm?,2
SOOKIE,How's Max doing?,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,I think I know what an aneurysm feels like before you have it.,2
SOOKIE,Like a baseball the size of a cantaloupe in your head.,2
LORELAI,Good one.,2
SOOKIE,What?,2
LORELAI,Baseball the size of a cantaloupe.,2
SOOKIE,Yeah.,2
LORELAI,"'Cause a baseball can only be one size, so it's a Yogi Berra type thing.",2
SOOKIE,Yogi Bear?,2
LORELAI,No. Forget it.,2
MICHELorelai,I feel like crap on toast.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, where were you after you broke off from the group?",2
MICHELorelai,"Oh, I sat at a table with Janet Jackson and Celine Dion. Very nice guys. Oh, by the way, your husband-to-be is out there looking annoyingly perky. Slap him or I will.",2
MAX,Hey!,2
LORELAI,Ahhh.,2
MAX,So what'd I do?,2
LORELAI,You spoke in a normal volume,2
MAX,Sorry.,2
LORELAI,"You did nothing wrong, I'm just mad you're not more hungover.",2
MAX,"I tried, I did.",2
LORELAI,"Ah, liar.",2
MAX,I drank copiously.,2
LORELAI,People who drank copiously the night before do not use words like copiously.,2
MAX,Ask my brother.,2
LORELAI,How is Mr. McMeterHopper?,2
MAX,"Ironically, he feels better than you.",2
LORELAI,"Uh, it's so wrong.",2
MAX,"He's fine. So I was gonna drop my printer off at the house but Rory wasn't there, and guess who doesn't possess his own set of keys yet.",2
LORELAI,"Ahh, guessing it's you.",2
MAX,Still me.,2
LORELAI,"Max, I'm sorry, I forgot.",2
MAX,Again.,2
LORELAI,Again. You're mad.,2
MAX,No. A little.,2
LORELAI,They're just keys.,2
MAX,Try being without them and say that.,2
LORELAI,I've lost my keys before.,2
MAX,"Well, I haven't lost them. I never got 'em.",2
LORELAI,You'll get them.,2
MAX,I'm trying really hard not to read too much into this.,2
LORELAI,Like what?,2
MAX,Like you don't want me having keys or you don't want me coming in the house.,2
LORELAI,"Max, that's crazy.",2
MAX,"Well, I need keys.",2
LORELAI,"Well, I need an assistant.",2
MAX,"No, you need to think about someone other than yourself for a few minutes a day.",2
LORELAI,Ouch.,2
MAX,That was too strong. Maybe I am a little hungover.,2
LORELAI,It's not a good day for keys or communication.,2
MAX,"You know what, I'll just bring the printer by later.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, bring it tomorrow.",2
MAX,I'll bring it tomorrow.,2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,I can't believe school's already starting.,2
LORELAI,Ugh. I used to hate school starting. I once flipped the pages back in a calendar my mom kept in the kitchen and tried to convince her it was June and not September.,2
RORY,Didn't work?,2
LORELAI,"Hmm, oddly enough.",2
RORY,I got an interesting call today.,2
LORELAI,"Oh yeah, who?",2
RORY,Dad.,2
LORELAI,Cool. How is he? I..I..I talked to him last night.,2
RORY,He mentioned that.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, I was about to mention it myself.",2
RORY,That's quite a coincidence.,2
LORELAI,Yeah. Did I not mention it last night?,2
RORY,"Huh, no, not to my knowledge.",2
LORELAI,I could've sworn I did.,2
RORY,Why'd you call him?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, just to check in.",2
RORY,At your bachelorette party?,2
LORELAI,Seemed as good a time as any.,2
RORY,To catch up on calls?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, pretty much.",2
RORY,Seems like a weird time.,2
LORELAI,Did he call just to fink on me?,2
RORY,No. He wanted to see what's up with you. He thought it was weird too.,2
LORELAI,Heaven forbid I ever use the phone again.,2
RORY,Was it when you told us you were calling Max?,2
LORELAI,Somewhere around there.,2
RORY,Why would you tell us you were calling Max?,2
LORELAI,"Honey, someday when you're a little older you will be introduced to something that is extremely seductive but fickle. A fair-weather friend who seems benign but packs a wallop like a donkey kick, and that is the Long Island iced tea. The Long Island iced tea makes you do things that you normally wouldn't do, like lifting your skirt in public or calling someone you normally wouldn't call at really weird times.",2
RORY,I'm not looking forward to meet ing the Long Island iced tea.,2
LORELAI,I'd definitely walk the other way.,2
RORY,"You know, Dad wants you to be happy.",2
LORELAI,I know.,2
RORY,And I really want you to be happy.,2
LORELAI,"I know, sweetie.",2
RORY,"You are happy about all this, aren't you?",2
LORELAI,Don't I seem happy?,2
RORY,I guess.,2
LORELAI,Okay then.,2
RORY,All right. I'll be in my room if you need me.,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,What is that?,2
LUKE,"Oh, it's a chuppah.",2
LORELAI,A what?,2
LUKE,"A chuppah. You stand under it, you and Max. It's for your wedding.",2
LORELAI,Did you make that?,2
LUKE,"Yeah, I had some time, so here, give me a hand, huh?",2
LORELAI,"Luke, it's beautiful.",2
LUKE,"Yeah, well, I saw a picture in a book. The picture looked better.",2
LORELAI,It's got carvings. Birds and flowers.,2
LUKE,"Yeah, there's also a goat.",2
LORELAI,A goat!,2
LUKE,"Yeah, I don't know what it stands for, but it was in the picture, and you like goats, right?",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, goats are good.",2
LUKE,"Okay, so there you go.",2
LORELAI,What on earth inspired you to do this?,2
LUKE,You're getting married. You can't just stand in the hot sun in the middle of a lawn that hasn't been mowed in weeks. I guess he doesn't mow.,2
LORELAI,"No, Max isn't a mower.",2
LUKE,"Okay, you needed something. Here it is. I'll mow it if you want.",2
LORELAI,We got a guy who does that. One of the Pete's from the nursery.,2
LUKE,Big Pete?,2
LORELAI,Little Pete.,2
LUKE,He's the better of the Pete's.,2
LORELAI,"We've always thought so. Hey, aren't chuppahs Jewish?",2
LUKE,Maybe.,2
LORELAI,Is it okay that Max and I aren't Jewish?,2
LUKE,It's okay by me.,2
LORELAI,"No, but I mean to stand under it. God won't smite us or anything?",2
LUKE,"I highly doubt it. Plus God'd probably have to get a license from Taylor to do any smiting in Stars Hollow on a weekend, so I'd say your safe. You know, I wasn't putting down Max. He seems like a really good guy.",2
LORELAI,"He is, and you were putting him down.",2
LUKE,"Yeah, well, I didn't mean to.",2
LORELAI,Did you mean all those things you said about marriage?,2
LUKE,What things?,2
LORELAI,You really want me to repeat them to you?,2
LUKE,"No. I mean, I guess, for some people marriage, you know, isn't the worst thing in the world. I mean, it's probably better than being hobbled or something like that.",2
LORELAI,"And people can evolve together, don't you think?",2
LUKE,Maybe.,2
LORELAI,"Yoko and John Lennon did. They just got closer and closer as the years went by. At the end, they had the same face.",2
LUKE,"Yeah, it got a little spooky.",2
LORELAI,But cool.,2
LUKE,"Yeah, they were lucky. I guess if you can find that one person, you know, who's willing to put up with all your crap, and doesn't want to change you or dress you or you know, make you eat French food, then marriage can be all right. But that's only if you find that person.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, if you find that person.",2
LORELAI,No one has ever made me a c huppah before.,2
LUKE,"Well, you only get married once. Theoretically.",2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,Pack!,2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,Pack.,2
RORY,What's going on?,2
LORELAI,We are hitting the road.,2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,Pack everything. Traveling light is for girls.,2
RORY,What's going on here? Why are we hitting the road?,2
LORELAI,We haven't taken a road trip in forever and the weather is perfect.,2
RORY,We can't take a road trip. You're getting married this weekend.,2
LORELAI,Do you have my blue swimsuit?,2
RORY,What about Max?,2
LORELAI,"Sunscreen, we need sunscreen.",2
RORY,"Mom, stop.",2
LORELAI,What?,2
RORY,Are you and Max getting married?,2
LORELAI,No.,2
RORY,Why?,2
LORELAI,Because I didn't want to try on my wedding dress every night.,2
RORY,Where are we going?,2
LORELAI,We don't have to.,2
RORY,"Hot, cold, rocky, sandy, mountain, valley?",2
LORELAI,I didn't really have a particular spot.,2
RORY,Packing for all contingencies. Got it. Light layers.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, light layers.",2
RORY,Do you need a book?,2
LORELAI,"Um, that Colette biography.",2
RORY,I lost your place in it.,2
LORELAI,That's okay. I have to start over anyway.,2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,And hurry.,2
RORY,Are we going tonight?,2
LORELAI,First thing in the morning.,2
RORY,Seven-ish?,2
LORELAI,Five-ish.,2
RORY,Wow.,2
LORELAI,It'll be more like six-ish.,2
RORY,Let's sh**t for five-ish.,2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,"Wow, totally deserted.",2
LORELAI,We're the last ones left.,2
RORY,So are we almost there?,2
LORELAI,We're almost there and nowhere near it. All that matters is we're going.,2
RORY,We're practically gone already.,2

LORELAI,Ah. No music. I can't believe we forgot to bring tunes.,2
RORY,Do you realize that neither of us has the vaguest idea where we are?,2
LORELAI,What is a road tip without tunes?,2
RORY,The sun is directly behind us.,2
LORELAI,Never been in this car for any extended period of time without playing AC/DC.,2
RORY,I have no idea which way it's going.,2
LORELAI,"I need my ""Highway to Hell.""",2
RORY,It's right out the windshield there.,2
LORELAI,"There's nothing on the radio but Top 40 and Christian Rock. Christian Rock, there's an oxymoron for you. I need my tunes.",2
RORY,Stop complaining about the tunes!,2
LORELAI,Stop complaining about our whereabouts.,2
RORY,"Well, my complaint is legitimate, yours is infantile.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, you're right. Ooh, ooh, yee-haw, yes. Country music, must be my lucky day.",2
RORY,We have to figure out where we're going.,2
LORELAI,No we don't.,2
RORY,Mom.,2
LORELAI,The point of this is to be spontaneous. To drive and land someplace we've never been and never expected to be.,2
RORY,Sounds risky.,2
Posted,11/04/01 06:15,2
LORELAI,Sounds exciting.,2
RORY,Serendipity has never been kind to us.,2
LORELAI,"Ah, yes, but I talked to serendipity on the phone last night. She feels bad about how she's treated us in the past. We had a nice chat. It's all gonna be different now.",2
RORY,"What did that sign say? It said ""Don't"" or ""Death"" on it.",2
LORELAI,Relax.,2
RORY,We're doomed!,2
LORELAI,Wrong. We're being guided by fate.,2
RORY,I think we're lost.,2
LORELAI,We can't be lost. We don't know where we're going.,2
RORY,You're going to stop before we drive into the Atlantic Ocean.,2
LORELAI,I'll try.,2
RORY,At least we'll know where we are.,2
LORELAI,Unless it's the Pacific.,2

RORY,,2
LORELAI,"You know what, I love road food.",2
RORY,I love it too.,2
LORELAI,"I mean, what can be better then what they serve at a Haden's Nut House?",2
RORY,Unless you don't like nuts.,2
LORELAI,"As if those people exist. You know, if I was in a rock band touring and stuff, I'd make the bus driver stop at every Haden's Nut House we pass.",2
RORY,,2
RORY,"Okay, so if we continue on the way we've been going who are you calling?",2
LORELAI,"Uh, Sookie.",2
RORY,Now?,2
LORELAI,"Uh, well, I didn't get a chance to call her before we left so she doesn't know about the ",2
RORY,Oh.,2
LORELAI,Yeah.,2
RORY,You okay?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, I guess. It's just, um Hi Sookie, it's me.",2
SOOKIE,"Hi Sweetie, you on your way in?",2
LORELAI,"Um, no, not yet. Actually, I'm um, I'm gonna be out of town for a couple of days.",2
SOOKIE,What?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, Rory and I decided to hit the road.",2
SOOKIE,But how can you be hitting the road? You're supposed to be getting ,2
LORELAI,"The engagement is off, Sookie.",2
SOOKIE,What? What happened?,2
LORELAI,"Well, it's a long story. I don't really wanna go into all the whats and whys and gory details right now, but you should know we all still love Max, and to figure out exactly what happened, you'd have to dig up Freud himself and have him work on me full time.",2
SOOKIE,"Aww, honey, I'm so sorry.",2
LORELAI,Thanks. So I hope you didn't get too far on that cake.,2
SOOKIE,"No, no, no. That's one thing you can be thankful about. You caught me in plenty of time.",2
LORELAI,"Good. I know the kind of work you were gonna put into it, and I just would've k*lled myself if you'd gone to all that craziness for nothing.",2
SOOKIE,"Yeah, well, I've been so busy lately, I actually forgot about it.",2
LORELAI,"Listen, do me a f avor. Mention canceling the wedding to Miss Patty, will you? That way, by the time w e get back ",2
SOOKIE,The whole town will know within the hour.,2
LORELAI,Then hopefully they will all have chatted it out of their systems before we get home.,2
SOOKIE,Consider it done. So where you going?,2
LORELAI,We have no idea.,2
SOOKIE,"Ah, my favorite kind of trip.",2
LORELAI,"Well, thanks. I'll talk to you soon. Just call the cell if you need anything.",2
SOOKIE,Okie dokie. Buh bye.,2
LORELAI,Bye.,2
SOOKIE,,2
LORELAI,That had better not be a map.,2
RORY,"I'm sorry, but I'm openly defying your no map policy.",2
LORELAI,Rory.,2
RORY,"Mom, it's gonna be dark in a couple of hours and I don't want to sleep in the car.",2
LORELAI,"Ugh, my sense of adventure did not translate to my offspring.",2
RORY,"Now, to the best of my map reading abilities, we're headed towards Portsmouth, New Hampshire.",2
LORELAI,Portsmouth. Huh.,2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,"I actually have a friend in Portsmouth. Donald, uhh, something-or-other Stein.",2
RORY,"A close personal friend, huh?",2
LORELAI,Donald moved there a couple of years ago and opened a B&B.,2
RORY,Ughhh.,2
LORELAI,"No, it's actually supposed to be pretty cool.",2
RORY,A cool B&B?,2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
RORY,That's like saying an understated Nicholas Cage movie.,2
LORELAI,"Listen, I myself am not usually a fan of the B&B, but Donald's place is different.",2
RORY,Captain Corelli's Mandolin.,2
LORELAI,I'm serious.,2
RORY,'Bella bambina at 2 o'clock.',2
LORELAI,Every room is decorated in a different weird style for a different century.,2
RORY,That is kinda cool.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, let's go.",2
RORY,Let's call.,2
LORELAI,Let's go.,2
RORY,Let's call.,2
LORELAI,Sense of adventure.,2
RORY,,2
LADONN,Hello there.,2
LORELAI,Hi.,2
LADONN,Would you like to ring the bell?,2
LORELAI,What?,2
LADONN,"Would you like to ring the bell, you or your daughter?",2
LORELAI,I don't understand.,2
LADONN,"I'm not usually sitting here when guests arrive, so people ring the bell and they love to ring the bell, and you didn't get to ring the bell.",2
LORELAI,Uh. . .,2
LADONN,Well done.,2
LORELAI,"Uh, do you have a room available?",2
LADONN,"Yes, we most certainly do, you lucky pretty things you.",2
LORELAI,See they have a room.,2
RORY,Good.,2
LORELAI,"Um, does Donald happen to be here?",2
LADONN,"Oh no no, I bought this place from Donald last year. It's my place now. I'm LaDonn.",2
LORELAI,"Hi. Oh, yes, I noticed it was a little different. Actually, very different.",2
LADONN,"Oh, did you see it before?",2
LORELAI,Pictures.,2
LADONN,"Well, it was wacky, just like Donald. It was fun, you know, but just a little too woo-woo. It was just too eclectic. I don't care for eclectic. I don't think B&B-ers do either.",2
LORELAI,"No, you wouldn't want anything out of the normal.",2
LADONN,"Okay, room number 3 is all yours. Welcome to the Cheshire Cat.",2
LORELAI,Nice name. I'm gonna consult with my daughter for just one second. We must leave this place immed iately.,2
RORY,And sleep where?,2
LORELAI,"Uh, a hollow tree, a riverbank, I don't care.",2
RORY,"Mom, I'm tired and I'm starving.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, she's named the place after an Alice in Wonderland character. This is my worst nightmare.",2
RORY,And dying of exposure in a Jeep is mine.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, okay.",2
LORELAI,"So, just point the way to room three.",2
LADONN,I'll take you there myself. Let me just grab your bags.,2
RORY,"Oh, we can do that.",2
LADONN,"No no no no no, you are my guests. I won't hear of it. There you go.",2
LORELAI,Oh.,2
LADONN,Do you wanna ring the bell? You haven't rung the bell.,2
RORY,Maybe some other time.,2
LADONN,Follow me. Watch out for Sammy.,2
LORELAI,Wowsie wowza.,2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,Aghhh!,2
LADONN,"What is it, dear?",2
LORELAI,"Uhh, there's just a lot ",2
RORY,A lot of flowers.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, like a ton of flowers.",2
RORY,A plethora of flowers.,2
LORELAI,A load of flowers.,2
LADONN,Thank you! I get so many compliments on this room.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, are they moving?",2
LADONN,"It looks like it, doesn't it? There's foil in the paper and it gives it that illusion. Isn't it terrific?",2
LORELAI,Unbelievable.,2
LADONN,"B&B-ers love a peaceful setting so that they can unwind from their hectic lives. What business are you in, dear?",2
LORELAI,"Oh, me? Uh, publishing.",2
LADONN,How interesting.,2
LORELAI,Mm.,2
LADONN,"Now if you need anything, you just ring down or come down 'cause I love company. And, oh, I don't want to forget to give you our activity list. Never a dull moment around here.",2
LORELAI,Thanks LaDonn.,2
RORY,"Yes, thank you.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, I think we just found the first room in the history of the world that would've made Liberace say 'Whoa. Step back. No one's that gay.'",2
RORY,"Oh, look. This is a book that past guests have written in.",2
LORELAI,Mmm.,2
RORY,'This room mad e my soul soar.',2
LORELAI,Ugh.,2
RORY,Ech.,2
LORELAI,"All right, enough grossness. Let's go eat.",2
RORY,,2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,Dentists. Boston dentists. Cocktail hour at the Cheshire Cat.,2
RORY,So?,2
LORELAI,So our exit is blocked.,2
RORY,Let's just rush pass them.,2
LORELAI,Too risky.,2
RORY,They're not assassins.,2
LORELAI,"Rory, if they catch us they'll clamp onto us like leeches, and you know what that means.",2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,"Chitchat. Stomach-churning, mind-numbing, soul-deadening chitchat.",2
RORY,"Mom, I'm starving. I'm going down there, you can stay here.",2
LORELAI,"You're that hungry, huh?",2
RORY,Yes.,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,"Ohh, ahhh, I struck gold!",2
RORY,What is it?,2
LORELAI,Certs.,2
RORY,Let me catch my breath.,2
LORELAI,I cannot for the life of me remember the last time I bought Certs.,2
RORY,Which would make those really old.,2
LORELAI,Fuzzy.,2
RORY,Perfect.,2
LORELAI,A nice capper to the day.,2
RORY,"In the course of three hours, they've participated in every inane B&B group activity known to man.",2
LORELAI,Let's just hope they finish with a mass su1c1de.,2
RORY,We get cranky when we're hungry.,2
LORELAI,"Well, plus we're above everyone else on the planet.",2
RORY,Clearly.,2
LORELAI,Hm.,2
RORY,So what do you want to do?,2
LORELAI,I don't know. We could go to sleep.,2
RORY,"Mm, it's 8:23.",2
LORELAI,Good Lord.,2
RORY,I'm not really sleepy.,2
LORELAI,Me neither. We could sing.,2
RORY,Sing?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, we could sing ""Anarchy in the UK"" at the top of our lungs.",2
RORY,"Oh, that would be good. Or, uh, we could talk.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, okay.",2
RORY,Okay.,2
LORELAI,What about?,2
RORY,"Oh, I don't know. Umm, Max?",2
LORELAI,"Uhh, no.",2
RORY,Why?,2
LORELAI,Because I don't want to.,2
RORY,You said we could talk.,2
LORELAI,"Yes, well I thought you meant about makeup or something.",2
RORY,When have we ever talked about makeup?,2
LORELAI,"Never, that's why I thought now would be a good time.",2
RORY,I just need to know if ,2
LORELAI,Goodnight Rory.,2
RORY,But ,2
LORELAI,Goodnight.,2
RORY,Are you sure that you're not just running scared?,2
LORELAI,Rory.,2
RORY,Because I think that you really love him but you're just freaked out ,2
LORELAI,Enough!,2
RORY," and you don't know what to do! Because you did this before. With Max, in fact.",2
LORELAI,"Rory, I don't want to talk about this. I thought that by saying 'enough' and turning off the light, you would get the message. Apparently not. The skywriter will be here in a minute.",2
RORY,I'm asking you a question.,2
LORELAI,I am a grown woman.,2
RORY,"Says the woman with the ""Hello, Kitty"" waffle iron.",2
LORELAI,I have earned the right not to be quizzed about my social life by my sixteen-year-old daughter.,2
RORY,I thought I was your best friend!,2
LORELAI,"When we're at a U2 concert, you are my best friend. But right now you are my sixteen- year-old daughter and I am telling you I do not want to have this conversation.",2
RORY,Well I do.,2
LORELAI,Well tough.,2
RORY,"Everything was planned! Everyone was excited, including you, and then all of a sudden, you're out!",2
LORELAI,"Well, I changed my mind.",2
RORY,This is our life that you just tossed off!,2
LORELAI,"Hey, I didn't just toss off anything!",2
RORY,We had plans! We made space in the closet!,2
LORELAI,"Oh Rory, just because we moved a couple of boxes is not reason enough for me to get married!",2
RORY,Max was counting on this! I was counting on this!,2
LORELAI,"Rory, stop it! We are not gonna have this fight in a flowery bedroom with dentists singing ""Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves"" in the background. It's too David Lynch!",2
RORY,I think you love him!,2
LORELAI,"Rory, go to sleep!",2
RORY,"I think you love him, and you got scared and you ran, but you're really going to regret it. And soon!",2
LORELAI,Rory!,2
RORY,Fine! Goodnight!,2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,What's with the face?,2
LORELAI,"Hmm, they're taller.",2
RORY,Not this again.,2
LORELAI,There's more of them.,2
RORY,"Mom, the flowers on the wallpaper are not growing or reproducing.",2
LORELAI,Hm.,2
RORY,"Wait a minute. You weren't writing in this thing, were you?",2
LORELAI,Maybe some random thoughts.,2
RORY,'Satanic forces are at work here.' Mom.,2
LORELAI,What?,2
RORY,What? What? We cannot write that in here. Here. 'Sat and forever am at work here.',2
LORELAI,That doesn't make any sense.,2
RORY,And it doesn't invoke the Dark Prince so I think it's preferable.,2
LORELAI,Whatever.,2
RORY,Hey?,2
LORELAI,What?,2
RORY,Last night?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, we're good.",2
RORY,Okay.,2
LORELAI,You know what isn't good?,2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,I ate the fuzzy Certs.,2
RORY,Gross!,2
LORELAI,They tasted like keys.,2
RORY,"Okay, enough. I have got to eat. Do you think the coast is clear downstairs?",2
LORELAI,"Let's check the schedule. Early morning nature walk, 7:30. Regional history talk, 8:15, bluppity blah bah bah bah. We're in luck. Breakfast just ended and the arts and crafts workshop doesn't begin for another thirteen minutes.",2
RORY,We've got a window!,2
LORELAI,It must be when they all shower.,2
RORY,Grab your bag!,2
LORELAI,,2
LADONN,Hello strangers!,2
RORY,Uh!,2
LORELAI,"Uhh, geez.",2
LADONN,We've all been so worried about you two.,2
LORELAI,What are you people doing?,2
LADONN,We're watching hummin gbirds.,2
WOMAN,They're still out there if you wanna scooch in.,2
MAN,They're the darndest things. Flap their wings a hundred times a second. It's an engineering marvel.,2
LORELAI,That was not on the freaking list.,2
LADONN,"We don't put things like this on the freaking list, because the delights of nature aren't on any kind of time schedule.",2
LORELAI,"No, Lordy.",2
WOMAN,So push in some chairs. We're gonna make some fresh scones.,2
LADONN,"Yeah, they're for tea this afternoon. I just brought out the first test batch. Have a taste.",2
RORY,A taste would not be bad.,2
LORELAI,"Uh, maybe just a quick taste.",2
WOMAN,"So, LaDonn says you're in publishing.",2
LORELAI,Huh?,2
WOMAN,"Publishing, you're in publishing?",2
LORELAI,"Oh yes, I am.",2
MAN,"Books, huh? You should find a field with less paperwork.",2
LORELAI,Good one.,2
RORY,Mmm! Hey!,2
LORELAI,"You have two, I still have one!",2
WOMAN,"So, uh, publishing?",2
LORELAI,"Mm hmm. Yes, I do publish. Um, it's kind of a dry line of work, not much to talk about.",2
LADONN,"Oh, nonsense. It's fascinating.",2
WOMAN,So what kind of books do you publish?,2
LORELAI,"Umm, mainly youth-oriented ones.",2
WOMAN,Children's books?,2
LORELAI,Sure.,2
WOMAN,"Oh, any that we've heard of?",2
LORELAI,Probably not.,2
WOMAN,"No, wait, please. Give me some titles. I'll write them down and then when I get home, I'll look them up. Dave, do you have your space pen?",2
MAN,Do you have to ask?,2
WOMAN,"Oh, he loves his space pen.",2
MAN,They write under water.,2
RORY,Cool.,2
WOMAN,"So, what are the titles?",2
LORELAI,"Well, there's um, 'Goodnight, Spoon' and um, 'The Horse that Wanted to Bark'.",2
WOMAN,"Oh, I think I've read that to my grandson. The horse learns to bark, and then he. . . oh, what happens at the end?",2
LORELAI,He dies.,2
RORY,"But he learned to bark though, so it's actually an upper.",2
WOMAN,"So, where are your offices?",2
LORELAI,"They're in the umm in the building with the uhh, over on the road would you guys excuse me for just a second? I have to make a very important call concerning publishing.",2
LADONN,"Oh, well that's just fine. It'll give us a chance to get to know your lovely daughter here.",2
WOMAN,She's so quiet. But we'll change all that.,2
RORY,"Mom, you promised not to do any business while on vacation.",2
LORELAI,"Honey, publishing waits for no man. Gotta keep the presses pressing.",2
WOMAN,,2
LORELAI,"Hey Sookie, it's me.",2
SOOKIE,"Hey sweetie, how's the trip going?",2
LORELAI,It's fine. Where are you?,2
SOOKIE,Luke's. Got a nice little show going on here.,2
LUKE,You're been sitting there for two hours.,2
KIRK,I just want a little more coffee.,2
LUKE,You've had eight refills.,2
KIRK,"You know, in France, when you sit and order, you can have the table as long as you want.",2
LUKE,I bet you know what I'm gonna say next.,2
KIRK,That we're not in France?,2
LUKE,Give or take a profanity.,2
KIRK,"Fine, I'll go. Can I have my check?",2
LORELAI,"So, um, how's the spreading of the news going?",2
SOOKIE,"Well, it worked just like you wanted, with one notable exception.",2
LORELAI,"Ooh, what?",2
SOOKIE,"He's just such a loner lately, the news hasn't gotten to him.",2
LUKE,Is there anyway to speed this up Kirk?,2
KIRK,Sorry. I'm trying to figure out the tip and I've always been terrible with math. What's six percent of four forty three?,2
LORELAI,"Could you just tell him now Sook, so I can cross this off my list?",2
SOOKIE,"Well, I ugh, he's coming over, hang on. Hey Luke?",2
LUKE,Yeah?,2
SOOKIE,"Have you heard the latest news, kinda sad, Lorelai and Max?",2
LUKE,What about them?,2
SOOKIE,The wedding's off.,2
LUKE,What? What happened?,2
SOOKIE,"You know, I don't really know. It was all kinda sudden. This is actually her now.",2
LUKE,"Oh, well, uh, tell her I'm sorry. That's tough.",2
SOOKIE,He says he's sorry.,2
LORELAI,Thanks. Talk to you later. Bye.,2
SOOKIE,Buh bye.,2
KIRK,What's this?,2
LUKE,Refill number nine,2
KIRK,I thought you said I had to go.,2
LUKE,You can hang a bit.,2
KIRK,Really?,2
LUKE,Welcome to France. Coffee's on the house too.,2
KIRK,Thanks. Or should I say gracias.,2
LUKE,"In fact, everyone's coffee's on the house today. I like your hat.",2
MAN,,2
WOMAN,We have a son just a bit older than you.,2
MAN,He's not good enough for her.,2
WOMAN,"Oh, Dave. He's a freshman at Brown.",2
MAN,He majors in MTV.,2
WOMAN,Oh you're horrible!,2
MAN,"Honey, we don't even know if she's on the market.",2
RORY,"Oh, I'm not on the market. I'm definitely off the market.",2
LADONN,She has a boyfriend.,2
WOMAN,How cute!,2
LADONN,Tell us all about him.,2
RORY,"Mom! I saved you a scone, you love me right?",2
LORELAI,"Uh, sorry everybody. I'm gonna have to drag her away now.",2
RORY,Aww shucks. It was so nice talking to you.,2
WOMAN,,2
RORY,I now have abandonment issues.,2
LORELAI,I had to make a call.,2
RORY,You left me hanging.,2
LORELAI,I owe you one.,2
RORY,Big time.,2
LORELAI,"All right. Well, you're out now, what do you wanna do?",2
RORY,k*ll you.,2
LORELAI,And?,2
RORY,I don't know. What do you wanna do?,2
LORELAI,Bounce tennis balls off of Sammy?,2
RORY,Seriously?,2
LORELAI,I'm not sure. Why don't you pull out the map you're hiding?,2
RORY,I'm not hiding a map.,2
RORY,"Well, I didn't want to drive around aimlessly again today.",2
LORELAI,"I got it, I got it. So what's near?",2
RORY,"Um, Concord.",2
LORELAI,"What is that, like look at grapes?",2
RORY,Manchester.,2
LORELAI,"Uh, been there, done that.",2
RORY,You've never been there.,2
LORELAI,Well I feel like I have.,2
RORY,Salem.,2
LORELAI,"Ooh, witches and stonings! There's something there.",2
RORY,"Boston, Newton, Needham ",2
LORELAI,"Oh, go go go go back.",2
RORY,"What? Boston, Newton?",2
LORELAI,I know where we're going.,2
RORY,Where are we going?,2
LORELAI,You will love it.,2
RORY,"Well, if you tell me where we're going I can chart a course and I can ",2
RORY,You're folding it wrong!,2
LORELAI,Is it smaller?,2
RORY,Yes.,2
LORELAI,Then it's not wrong. Let's go. I will get you a new one when we get there.,2
RORY,,2
RORY,I don't believe it.,2
LORELAI,"Believe it, 'cause there it is.",2
RORY,Harvard University.,2
LORELAI,It's really real.,2
RORY,It looks just like the pictures.,2
LORELAI,Beautiful.,2
RORY,What are we doing here?,2
LORELAI,We are beholding your future.,2
RORY,It's big.,2
LORELAI,You have a big future.,2
RORY,I can't believe it. I'm actually standing outside of Harvard.,2
LORELAI,Come on.,2
RORY,Wait. Come on where?,2
LORELAI,Inside.,2
RORY,We can't go inside.,2
LORELAI,"Why, is there a force field or something around the place?",2
RORY,This is Harvard.,2
LORELAI,I know.,2
RORY,This is Harvard.,2
LORELAI,I know.,2
RORY,You can't just go inside. You need a guide.,2
LORELAI,I'll be your guide.,2
RORY,What do you know about Harvard?,2
LORELAI,"I know this. Look, there's Harvard.",2
RORY,Mom.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, don't you want to see it? Huh? The place where you'll be living and studying anddeveloping very naïve but pretentious world views that will come crashing down the minute you graduate?",2
RORY,"Yeah, I do.",2
LORELAI,"So? Come on, you know you want to. All the other kids are doing it.",2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,Wow! Harvard is over 300 years old.,2
RORY,Founded in 1636.,2
LORELAI,That means that almost everyone who ever went to Harvard is dead now. Are you sure you still want to go here?,2
RORY,"Yes, I'm sure.",2
LORELAI,"They developed the pacemaker here. Also, discovered how electromagnetism and radioactivity are two manifestations of the same force and postulated existence of a charmed quark. I was wondering who did that.",2
RORY,The smarties at Harvard.,2
LORELAI,"Holy smokes. They get an average of 18,000 applicants every year and only 2,000 get in. Those are not good odds.",2
RORY,Mom.,2
LORELAI,"No no no, you're different. Past graduates. Henry James isn't that a beer?",2
RORY,And a novelist. Go on.,2
LORELAI,John Adams. That's a beer!,2
RORY,Our second president. He's very in right now.,2
LORELAI,"W.E.B. Du Bois, Yo-Yo Ma. Oh cool! Fred Gwynn.",2
RORY,Who?,2
LORELAI,Herman Munster. Now I'm impr essed.,2
RORY,Do you want something?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, a nice cold Henry James.",2
RORY,Or some coffee?,2
LORELAI,Or some coffee.,2
RORY,I'm ordering coffee at Harvard.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, there's people looking for roommates. Tons of them. 'Wanted, girl to share a two bedroom apartment located on trial bridge, quiet street, quiet building, so quiet roomie a must.' Join a convent and cloister yourself you loser.",2
RORY,"Mom, it's gonna be two years before I go to Harvard. These people will have roommat es or have graduated by them.",2
LORELAI,Who says these are for you?,2
RORY,Who are they for?,2
LORELAI,"Me. If you're gonna live in a dorm, I need a room nearby so I can come visit.",2
RORY,How often are you gonna visit?,2
LORELAI,"I don't know, every other day. Too much? What's too much?",2
STUDENT,"Man, there are a lot of postings here.",2
LORELAI,"Oh yeah, there sure are.",2
STUDENT,You looking for a place to live?,2
LORELAI,"Uhh, maybe.",2
STUDENT,Well there's a lot of choices. Something for everybody.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, yeah. Unless you're one of those existentialists who can't really figure out what they want.",2
STUDENT,"Good point, good point. Hey, I think we have a class together. Contract Law, Professor Chefferson?",2
LORELAI,"Oh yeah, Chef's class.",2
STUDENT,Right. I've been meaning to say hi to you.,2
LORELAI,Really?,2
STUDENT,Yeah.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, hi.",2
STUDENT,Hi.,2
LORELAI,Hi.,2
STUDENT,So do you like the class?,2
LORELAI,"Um, it's not too bad.",2
STUDENT,He's kinda got a monotone voice. If I don't caf up he puts me right to sleep.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, I'm about to caf up right now just for the hell of it.",2
STUDENT,Okay. So I'll see you in class. And maybe at that Phi Cap party tonight?,2
LORELAI,Ginchy!,2
STUDENT,Cool. Bye.,2
LORELAI,Bye.,2
LORELAI,"I think I'm gonna like college! Ooh, did you hear? I used existentialist in a sentence!",2
RORY,I heard!,2
LORELAI,I've always wanted to do that.,2
RORY,It was very impressive.,2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,Oh my.,2
LORELAI,What's this?,2
RORY,It's the library.,2
LORELAI,Oh.,2
RORY,The biggest library I've ever seen.,2
LORELAI,Uh oh. Brace yourself.,2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,This is just one of the libraries.,2
RORY,One of the libraries?,2
LORELAI,"This building is one component of a thirteen million volume collection housed in more than ninety different libraries. It's the oldest library in the United States and the largest academic library in the world. Breathe, breathe.",2
RORY,I'm a failure.,2
LORELAI,What?,2
RORY,I am stupid.,2
LORELAI,Oh stop.,2
RORY,I am uniformed and ignorant and. . .I can't even think of a second synonym for uninformed. I suck.,2
LORELAI,Honey.,2
RORY,"Thirteen million volumes? I've read like, what, three hundred books in my entire life and I'm already sixteen? Do you know how long it would take me to read thirteen million books?",2
LORELAI,"But honey, you don't have to read every one of them. ""Tuesday's with Morrie?"" Skip that. ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" Just stuff you already know.",2
RORY,"Okay, but every kid coming to Harvard is inevitably reading books, and different books, and I want to be able to converse intelligently with each of them and I can't do that unless I read books, at least a few from every genre and sub-genre.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, come on. I'm getting you out of here.",2
RORY,I sleep too much.,2
LORELAI,No you don't.,2
RORY,I've been frittering away my whole life.,2
LORELAI,You don't fritter.,2
RORY,Did I mention I suck?,2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
RORY,Well I do.,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,"This is a dorm? Not bad, huh?",2
RORY,"Pretty, actually.",2
LORELAI,"Come on, let's see what it looks like on the inside.",2
RORY,,2
RORY,We're gonna get in trouble.,2
LORELAI,"You're such a worrywart. Ooh, get in character.",2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,Hey there! GIRL 1: Hi.,2
LORELAI,"I'm Angie, this is Trish. GIRL 2: Hi.",2
LORELAI,How's it going? GIRL 1: Not bad.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, cool. We're just kinda hanging out between classes. We got Chef next. So, we'll probably see you at the Phi Alpha Beta thing tomorrow, right? GIRL 1: Maybe.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, I know, we're not sure either. They can be so totally lame. Gag me. GIRL 1: Yeah. See ya.",2
RORY,You do realize that all of your college kid jargon comes from 'Happy Days' and the 'Valley Girls' song?,2
LORELAI,Unh! Lookie lookie here.,2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,"Ooh, I wanna see a room. Hello!",2
RORY,They have pictures of their rooms on their website.,2
LORELAI,"So I prefer reality, thank you. Hello! Coast is clear.",2
RORY,The coast is not clear.,2
LORELAI,Susie!,2
RORY,We're now officially breaking and entering.,2
LORELAI,Susie!,2
RORY,Why are you saying that?,2
LORELAI,"'Cause it's our cover in case we get caught. Plus there's a thirty percent chance that the girl living in this room is named Susie. Wow, tiny.",2
RORY,It is tiny.,2
LORELAI,Your Oxford English Dictionary's gonna need a room of it's own.,2
RORY,It'll fit somewhere.,2
LORELAI,"One window, brick wall. You're gonna need a better view.",2
RORY,"Well, this isn't my room to begin with.",2
LORELAI,At least there's two beds. Somewhere for me to sleep.,2
RORY,That would be my roommat e's bed.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, you don't want a roommate.",2
RORY,I don't think I have a choice.,2
LORELAI,They just force someone on you?,2
RORY,It's all part of the socializing experience.,2
LORELAI,What if it's a lemon?,2
RORY,Then I'm stuck with a lemon.,2
LORELAI,Hari Krishna banging a tambourine all night?,2
RORY,Then I have to get earplugs.,2
LORELAI,Serial m*rder*r?,2
RORY,Then I sleep with a gat strapped to my ankle.,2
LORELAI,Someone who likes Linkin Park?,2
RORY,Then I have to drop out.,2
LORELAI,"Mm hmm. Ah, look! I had these same pants back in high school.",2
RORY,Can we just go now please?,2
LORELAI,I'm in again.,2
RORY,Mom.,2
LORELAI,Okay. Just come over here and let me take a picture with you sitting at the desk.,2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, really get into it. Pretend like you're studying.",2
RORY,"Uhh, okay.",2
LORELAI,What  is that you're writing in the air?,2
RORY,Can we just take the picture?,2
LORELAI,"Okay, okay.",2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,"God, these classrooms are huge.",2
LORELAI,Better to fit those big Harvard brains.,2
PROFESSORory,". . . had given birth. Reckon on everything, expect everything. What sort of thought is this?",2
STUDENT,Depressing?,2
PROFESSORory,"On the surface, maybe. But go underneath. What is he postulating beyond fatalism?",2
LORELAI,Are we allowed to be hearing this?,2
RORY,I don't know.,2
LORELAI,They wouldn't charge you a hundred bucks or something just for listening to part of a class?,2
RORY,I don't think Harvard would nickel and dime people like that.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, I'm gonna find a ladies room. You know, sneak a smoke, see if anybody slipped an aspirin in my coke.",2
RORY,"Okay, Rizzo. I'd like to listen a little bit more.",2
LORELAI,I'll be back.,2
RORY,I'll be here.,2
PROFESSORory,The stoics believe the greatest happiness resulted from leading a virtuous life ,2
PROFESSORory,In or out?,2
RORY,Excuse me?,2
PROFESSORory,"If you're going to take the class, you have to take a seat.",2
RORY,"Oh, uhh, okay. Sorry.",2
PROFESSORory,,2
RORY,,2
RORY,"That's because stoicism was not about giving up things, of money and luxuries and stuff.",2
PROFESSORory,"That's right. By the time he was in his early forties, Seneca had earned enough money to acquire villas, farms, he ate well, he loved expensive furniture, but he didn't consider that a non-philosophical way to live.",2
RORY,It's all kind of relative though.,2
STUDENT,"Oh, here we go.",2
RORY,What?,2
STUDENT,We can't get through a class without debating relativism.,2
RORY,I just meant that luxury to some is not necessarily luxury to others.,2
PROFESSORory,A better subject for another time.,2
RORY,Oh sorry.,2
PROFESSORory,"No, no, your point is well taken, but it's different than the matter at hand. What we're talking about is Seneca's choosing the better more comfortable of two options while remaining a stoic.",2
RORY,,2
RORY,Did you see me?,2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
RORY,I was in college.,2
LORELAI,It was amazing!,2
RORY,Did I look like I belonged?,2
LORELAI,Completely. You're a natural,2
RORY,"I can't even believe how it happened. I just sort of got swept up and then the teacher asked a question, and before I knew it ",2
LORELAI,You were blowing them away.,2
RORY,"Well, I don't know if I was blowing them away but suddenly I was talking and I couldn't stop.",2
LORELAI,I know that feeling.,2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,"Oh, please LaDonn, we can carry the bags.",2
LADONN,Nonsense.,2
RORY,But they're so heavy.,2
LADONN,I'll just get them down the stairs for you. Whew. Let me catch my breath here.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, wow! Sammy's AWOL, huh?",2
LADONN,Hmm?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, Sammy. It's like the first time that she hasn't been there on the stairs.",2
LADONN,"What, my Sammy?",2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
LADONN,"Oh, she's rarely ever on the stairs.",2
LORELAI,"Oh no, she's always right there.",2
LADONN,On the stairs?,2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
LADONN,"No, she has her favorite places, but not on the stairs.",2
LORELAI,There has not been one moment over our entire stay when she has not been right there.,2
LADONN,On the stairs?,2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
LADONN,"Oh, she's hardly ever on the stairs.",2
RORY,"Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown.",2
LADONN,Everything's on your card. I hope you enjoyed your stay. Did you enjoy your stay?,2
RORY,Very much.,2
LADONN,"Aw, very much?",2
LORELAI,I sat and forever am at work here.,2
LADONN,What?,2
RORY,It was great.,2
LADONN,"Well, there you go. Drive safely, and tell all your friends about the Cheshire Cat.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, you bet we will.",2
LADONN,"As soon as you leave, I'm gonna do my favorite part of the job.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, what's that?",2
LADONN,I'm gonna read what you wrote in our guestbook.,2
LORELAI,Give us a five minute headstart?,2
LADONN,Beg pardon?,2
RORY,,2
RORY,You know what I love most about Harvard?,2
LORELAI,"No, what?",2
RORY,They don't sell giant foam fingers.,2
LORELAI,"No, they've got class out the wazoo. Home.",2
RORY,Feel like we've been gone a long time.,2
LORELAI,"You know what's weird? Every time I leave town, even for just a little while, I always expect everything to look different.",2
RORY,And it never does.,2
LORELAI,It never does.,2
KIRK,Need a hug?,2
LORELAI,Patty's good.,2
LORELAI,"So, what about dinner?",2
RORY,It should probably be something healthy since we've been eating junk the whole trip.,2
LORELAI,We had lettuce on our burgers last night.,2
RORY,You picked it off.,2
LORELAI,But it left its essence.,2
RORY,There was lettuce essence on our burgers?,2
LORELAI,Definitely.,2
RORY,And that satisfied our vegetable requirement?,2
LORELAI,For the week.,2
RORY,We can't argue with cold hard facts.,2
RORY,"What? Oh, I forgot about that.",2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,"This is Sever Hall, one of the oldest buildings in Harvard.",2
EMILY,Focus the picture Lorelai.,2
LORELAI,It is focused.,2
RORY,That's how it came out.,2
EMILY,It's hurting my eyes.,2
LORELAI,"Come on Mom, they're supposed to be a little arty.",2
RORY,Plus she doesn't know how to use her camera.,2
LORELAI,I've only had it six years.,2
EMILY,It's like I have glaucoma. What's that?,2
LORELAI,That is a Harvard squirrel.,2
EMILY,Good grief.,2
RORY,Sitting on a Harvard rock.,2
LORELAI,Doesn't he look smart?,2
EMILY,He looks dirty. Next.,2
LORELAI,"That's Rory's dorm, and part of my finger.",2
RORY,It's not my dorm yet. We just saw a dorm and figured it might be mine.,2
EMILY,Why in the world do you insist on taking slides?,2
LORELAI,I like slides.,2
EMILY,"But prints are so much easier, and faster to get through.",2
LORELAI,That's what I hate about prints. You give people this big pile of pictures that you're so proud of and they end up just flipping through them super fast without really seeing them or giving you a chance to narrate them like you can with slides.,2
RORY,I stopped her from adding music.,2
EMILY,I'm eternally grateful.,2
LORELAI,I like the bigness of slides too. Makes you feel like you're really there.,2
EMILY,"Yes, this one makes me feel just like I'm in your finger.",2
LORELAI,Oh. You're just jealous that we didn't invite you to come along.,2
RORY,Next time.,2
EMILY,"Next time you go to Harvard, you're going to do it properly, with a scheduled visit and a guide.",2
RORY,I told her about the guide.,2
EMILY,And why would you go out of town now so soon before your wedding? Didn't your fiancé mind?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, well ",2
EMILY,"I mean, you act as if this coming weekend is just going to be business as usual and not the most important day of your life.",2
RORY,Mom.,2
EMILY,What?,2
LORELAI,"Well, it's about this weekend Mom.",2
EMILY,Yes?,2
LORELAI,I should've told you before.,2
EMILY,"Oh my God, you didn't!",2
LORELAI,What?,2
EMILY,You did!,2
LORELAI,I did what?,2
EMILY,You eloped!,2
LORELAI,Mom.,2
EMILY,I knew it! I knew you'd do anything to keep me out of this wedding.,2
LORELAI,"Mom, that's not ",2
EMILY,"Well that is just cruel, Lorelai. A mother waits and plans for this day, even your mother.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, but ",2
EMILY,"I bought a new dress, I got my hair done.",2
LORELAI,It looks nice.,2
EMILY,"And tonight you just waltz in here, t*rture me for hours with these ridiculous slides, only to let me know at the last possible minute ",2
LORELAI,"Mom, Max and I are not together anymore. The wedding is off.",2
EMILY,The wedding's off?,2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
EMILY,Are you sure?,2
LORELAI,"Yes, I'm sure.",2
EMILY,Oh.,2
LORELAI,Mom?,2
EMILY,Who called it off?,2
LORELAI,I did. You're thinking you're not surprised.,2
EMILY,No I wasn't.,2
LORELAI,"You're thinking, 'Yes, I won that five bucks from Dad.'",2
EMILY,Who would like dessert?,2
LORELAI,What Mom? What are you thinking? Just tell me.,2
EMILY,I was thinking I guess I have to return your gift.,2
LORELAI,My gift?,2
EMILY,That's right.,2
LORELAI,You'll have to return my gift. That's that's what you were thinking?,2
EMILY,That's right.,2
LORELAI,That's it?,2
EMILY,That's it.,2
LORELAI,Oh. So you got me a g ift already?,2
EMILY,You were getting married. Gifts are expected. It's the proper thing to do. So how's ice cream sound?,2
RORY,Ice cream sounds great.,2
LORELAI,So what'd you get me M om?,2
EMILY,I'm not gonna tell you that.,2
LORELAI,Why not? It's for me.,2
EMILY,But you're not getting it now.,2
LORELAI,"Iced tea spoons, right?",2
EMILY,Lorelai.,2
LORELAI,"Because nobody really needs iced tea spoons ever. I mean, you probably would use 'em if you rememb ered to use 'em but nobody remembers to use 'em because they're always in a different drawer than the everyday silverware. Out of sight, out of mind. So people just grab a regular old everyday spoon to stir with, and you know what, they work fine.",2
EMILY,It wasn't iced tea spoons.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, uhhh oh, oh! Corn on the cob holder thingies! Sterling silver corn on the cob holder thingies?",2
EMILY,Nope.,2
LORELAI,Hah!,2
EMILY,What?,2
LORELAI,The tiny forks.,2
EMILY,What tiny forks?,2
LORELAI,The tiny forks with the tiny prongs and the tiny handles that I can only assume are used to eat the tiny food.,2
EMILY,They're for lobster tails.,2
LORELAI,So you did get the tiny forks!,2
EMILY,"You know what, I'm not returning the gift. I'm going to put it away in a closet and you won't know what it is until you do get married someday.",2
LORELAI,Tell me now!,2
EMILY,Sorry.,2
LORELAI,"Come on! Mom, I may never get married. I may be a free spirit my whole life or fall in love with a separated catholic guy like Katherine Hepburn did and then, and then not get to go to his funeral when he dies.",2
EMILY,"Well then you'll never get to know what I got you, will you?",2
LORELAI,I've gotta know!,2
EMILY,No.,2
LORELAI,This is t*rture!,2
EMILY,Tough.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, fine, forget it. I'm going to the bathroom.",2
EMILY,I'm going to the kitchen.,2
LORELAI,Hm.,2
EMILY,Hm.,2
LORELAI,HAH!,2
EMILY,"Oh God, you scared me!",2
LORELAI,"Come on, tell me!",2
EMILY,"Lorelai, get away.",2
LORELAI,Tell me now.,2
EMILY,"I'm serious, get away from me.",2
LORELAI,Please tell me.,2
EMILY,,2
LORELAI,"Hey, am I too far from the curb?",2
RORY,"Oh, you're within five feet.",2
LORELAI,Close enough for jazz.,2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,Huh?,2
RORY,Pick it up?,2
LORELAI,You got it.,2
LANE,Rory!,2
RORY,"Oh my God, Lane!",2
LANE,I'm back!,2
RORY,I see!,2
LANE,"Oh, did you ever think this day would come?",2
RORY,"I had hopes, dreams.",2
LANE,"I escaped from Korea, I'm home. Hi Lorelai.",2
LORELAI,"Welcome home, sweetie.",2
LANE,"It's so amazing to be back. When I got off the plane, I kissed the tarmac.",2
LORELAI,Just like the Pope.,2
LANE,It was hot and I burned my lips.,2
RORY,Maybe that's why the Pope always looks so grumpy.,2
LANE,I'm back!,2
RORY,I know!,2
LANE,Did you get my letters?,2
RORY,"Yeah, the first one was a little intense.",2
LANE,Which one was that?,2
RORY,The one that said Korea equals death with a bunch of exclamation points and your very sad face cut up plastered all over it.,2
LANE,"Okay, so that was a tad dramatic.",2
RORY,Was it awful?,2
LANE,"You know what, it wasn't.",2
LORELAI,Really?,2
LANE,Some of it was great.,2
RORY,No way.,2
LANE,"Yeah, some of the food's not so bad, and then my cousins were actually pretty interesting, and the best part, Korea is bootleg heaven. I totally scored in Seoul. Elvis Costello at the Marquee in 1978. A barely coherent Nico doing Dora songs in 1974, and even more barely coherent, Iggy Pop doing David Bowie songs naked in 1981.",2
RORY,How did you get them past customs?,2
LANE,"Well, I strapped them to my body like in Midnight Express.",2
RORY,Cool.,2
LORELAI,I'll be in Luke's.,2
RORY,Okay. So it was just an open-ended plane ticket?,2
LANE,Just to save money. I guess I kind of overreacted.,2
RORY,,2
LUKE,Hey!,2
LORELAI,Lewis and Clark have returned.,2
LUKE,"Oh yeah, which one are you?",2
LORELAI,I don't know. Which one had to paddle the canoe?,2
LUKE,Coffee?,2
LORELAI,You have to ask?,2
LUKE,"So, uh, sorry about what happened you know, the wedding thing ",2
LORELAI,It's okay. I'm fine. I want everyone to know that.,2
LUKE,"Uh, I've been feeling like a jerk.",2
LORELAI,Why?,2
LUKE,"Well, the way I had to come down on Max. I don't know, I was being a I don't know, what's that word you use, pickleschnitz?",2
LORELAI,Schnickelfritz?,2
LUKE,"Yeah, that's it.",2
LORELAI,"Luke, it's okay, you already apologized for all that.",2
LUKE,"Well, I've been feeling kind of guilty.",2
LORELAI,"Don't. You are great, Luke. Just making me that chuppah alone ",2
LUKE,"Oh, the chuppah! I left that stupid chuppah on your lawn!",2
LORELAI,"Hey, it's okay.",2
LUKE,What an idiot!,2
LORELAI,"Really, it's okay.",2
LUKE,"Just this enormous reminder, just sitting on your lawn, mocking you.",2
LORELAI,"I didn't even see it mock, I promise.",2
LUKE,"I'll take it down in the morning. No, I'll take it down now. Hey, we're closing early. Chew it or lose it!",2
LORELAI,"Hey, Luke, it's okay, really. I, uh, I think I'm gonna keep it.",2
LUKE,What?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah. It's beautiful, and you made it for me, and it doesn't have to be a wedding chuppah. It can just be a beautiful archway in our yard. I'll grow stuff on it.",2
LUKE,"Well, okay. Um, I'll help you move it around the yard, wherever you want it to be.",2
LORELAI,"Well, that'd be good.",2
LUKE,So where'd you guys go?,2
LORELAI,"Well, we drove around a little, we hit a B&B, and we took a tour of Harvard.",2
LUKE,Harvard. . . interesting.,2
LORELAI,"It was amazing. Seeing Rory there, in a dorm room, in a classroom. She fit.",2
LUKE,"Yeah, I can see her fitting there.",2
LORELAI,She was right at home.,2
LUKE,"So, how you taking that?",2
LORELAI,Taking what?,2
LUKE,Seeing her fit?,2
LORELAI,I loved it and I hated it.,2
LUKE,That seems about right.,2
LORELAI,"Man, these past few days. . .just so many thoughts about my life then, my life now, what I missed. Thoughts about what I'll never have, and what I want to have.",2
LUKE,"Yeah, that's a lot of thoughts.",2
LORELAI,You're not kidding. So can I ask you a question?,2
LUKE,Yeah.,2
LORELAI,Have you ever set up a line of credit at a bank?,2
LUKE,No.,2
LORELAI,"But you don't pay for everything with cash on hand, do you?",2
LUKE,What's all this about?,2
LORELAI,I think it's time to make a move.,2
LUKE,Meaning?,2
LORELAI,I'm diving in. Sookie and I are finally gonna open that inn.,2
LUKE,"Yeah, I know.",2
LORELAI,"No, I mean now. We've been talking about it and dreaming about it and it's time to finally get going on it.",2
LUKE,"Well, if the time is right.",2
LORELAI,It is. Think I can hack being a business owner?,2
LUKE,I think you can hack anything.,2
LORELAI,Really?,2
LUKE,"Yeah. I mean, you know all the creative stuff to the job, and you can manage and uh, I've seen you try to add numbers, so I'd get an accountant first thing.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, yes.",2
LUKE,So how far along are you?,2
LORELAI,This far.,2
LUKE,"Well, listen, um, you know, I'm no financial genius, but you know, we can sit down sometime, and you can pick my brain on the few things I do know about.",2
LORELAI,Really?,2
LUKE,"Sure, I've been around some.",2
LORELAI,Can I ask you stupid questions?,2
LUKE,There's no such thing.,2
LORELAI,How does ink come out of pens?,2
LUKE,"All right, there is such a thing. But, um, you're going to avoid that when we sit down, right?",2
LORELAI,Right. Thank you.,2
LUKE,,2
LORELAI,,2
LANE,So fill me in . What have you been up to? I've gotta know everything.,2
RORY,I've been to Harvard.,2
LANE,No way. Oh my God! How? When?,2
RORY,"Well, we just got back. Mom, is it okay if I go to Lane's for a bit?",2
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah. I'll meet you back at the house.",2
RORY,Okay.,2
LANE,"Harvard, that is so cool! I mean, what did you see?",2
RORY,"Oh, Harvard Yard, classrooms, where I might live next year.",2
LANE,How was it?,2
RORY,It needs a spruce.,2

LORELAI,Good.,2
RORY,I'm glad.,2
LORELAI,They're still good.,2
RORY,I'm still glad.,2
LORELAI,"Look freak, we will not be late.",2
RORY,It's the first day of school. I wanna get there early.,2
LORELAI,"We will be there early, I promise.",2
RORY,"I have different classes this year, my routes aren't the same. I haven't found the quickest path around. And my locker, they moved it, so I don't even know if it'll work properly and then I'll have to get a new one and God knows how long that'll take or where it'll be and that could send the whole day into chaos. I'm just excited.",2
LANE,"Oh, thank God, you haven't left yet.",2
RORY,"Nope, what's up?",2
LANE,"Well, I found the greatest record store in the world. It's ten minutes from your school and I'm wondering how much you love me.",2
RORY,Address.,2
LANE,"Record Breaker Incorporated, 2453 Berlin Turnpike.",2
RORY,Got it. Place your order now.,2
Posted,11/11/01 10:18,2

LORELAI,Mm.,2
RORY,Right.,2
LANE,"The Sonics, Here are the Sonics.",2
RORY,Burn me a c opy. Next.,2
LANE,"MC5, Kick Out the Jams. Fairport Convention, Leige and Lief. BeeGees, Odessa.",2
RORY,"BeeGees, really?",2
LANE,"Well, Mojo says.",2
RORY,So it must be true.,2
LANE,"Okay, that's it. Now if I could just find a copy of Whistler, Chaucer, Detroit and Greenhill, I will finally be done with the sixties.",2
RORY,"I can get there today, tomorrow at the latest.",2
LANE,I love it when you go back to school.,2
RORY,Me too. Hey!,2
LORELAI,"I am getting donuts for later. As soon as I do, I will take you to school and the nice men in the white coats will pick you up.",2
TAYLORory,"Everybody, listen up. Decide what you want, place your order, and then proceed to the end of the line. BOY 1: I want a burger. BOY 2: I want grilled cheese. BOY 3: Me too. BOY 2: And I want fries, and make them really really cripsy. BOY 1: I want mine crispy too. BOY 2: You didn't order fries. BOY 1: So?",2
LUKE,So you can't order crispy fries without first ordering fries. BOY 1: Why not?,2
LUKE,Because you can't make something crispy that doesn't exist. BOY 1: Why not?,2
LUKE,Get him away from me Taylor.,2
TAYLORory,Have some respect. These boys have just completed the first leg of their outdoor survival training.,2
LUKE,Meaning you had them sit under a tree and glue rocks together for two hours.,2
TAYLORory,You're a very jaded man Luke. What happened to you as a child?,2
LUKE,Some creepy guy in shorts and knee socks tried to sit me under a tree and glue rocks together for two hours. Put that down! BOY 4: Why?,2
LUKE,Because otherwise you're going under it. BOY 4: I won't fit.,2
LUKE,Oh yes you will.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, donuts please. BOY 1: We were here first!",2
LORELAI,On the planet? BOY 1: Huh?,2
LORELAI,"You lose. Chocolate, cinnamon and sprinkles.",2
LUKE,All of you pipe down.,2
LORELAI,"Grups, huh?",2
LUKE,"Yeah, I'm working. What do you think I'm doing? Uh huh. Uh huh. Oh man, what did you do? Excuse me, are you serious? Just like that, huh? BOY 2: Hey Mr. Doose. She's not supposed to do that.",2
TAYLORory,"That's right. She's breaking the rules, and people who break the rules end up very lonely with no friends because they have become society's outcasts.",2
LORELAI,"Planning on burning a little Huck Finn after lunch, Taylor?",2
TAYLORory,Excuse me?,2
LUKE,"This is unbelievable! You won't ever change, will you? . . . Okay, fine. Do what you want, make the arrangements. Now I'm working, we'll finish this later.",2
LORELAI,Is everything okay?,2
LUKE,Do you have a sister?,2
LORELAI,"Um, no. BOY 1: I do.",2
LUKE,,2
LORELAI,Hey.,2
LUKE,Hello.,2
LORELAI,What are you doing?,2
LUKE,"Ah, just redecorating the sidewalk.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, it looks nice.",2
LUKE,"Yeah yeah yeah, you don't think too much blue?",2
LORELAI,"No, just enough.",2
LUKE,"Yeah, well, thanks for the input. You can go now.",2
LORELAI,Need some help?,2
LUKE,Nope.,2
LORELAI,Need some help?,2
LUKE,Nope.,2
LORELAI,Need some help?,2
LUKE,Nope.,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,"Frosted Flakes? Since when do you buy Frosted Flakes? Okay, now what is going on?",2
LUKE,Nothing.,2
LORELAI,Nothing? You just all of sudden woke up this morning and decided you were gonna buy every food item in the world that you don't actually eat?,2
LUKE,It's not for me.,2
LORELAI,Well who's it for?,2
LUKE,Someone who's not me.,2
LORELAI,Like who?,2
LUKE,Like my nephew.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, your nephew's coming to visit.",2
LUKE,"No, he's coming to stay.",2
LORELAI,You're sister's moving here?,2
LUKE,Nope.,2
LORELAI,"Well, I'm sorry, I don't get it.",2
LUKE,"There's nothing to get. It's just Liz. She's too busy, she can't handle him, she's sending him here.",2
LORELAI,Where's his dad?,2
LUKE,"Oh well, the great prize that my sister picked up at a Der Wienerschnitzel left her about two years ago, whereabouts unknown.",2
LORELAI,"Aww, geez.",2
LUKE,Yup.,2
LORELAI,"So she's just sending him here, just like that?",2
LUKE,"Oh no, I'm sure she put at least five or six minutes of thought into it.",2
LORELAI,But why?,2
LUKE,"Well, 'cause apparently he's been getting into some trouble and Liz is afraid he's heading for something bad, and rather than handle it herself, she's just giving up. She's sending him here so I can straighten him out.",2
LORELAI,You?,2
LUKE,Yes.,2
LORELAI,You can straighten him out?,2
LUKE,Yes.,2
LORELAI,"You, Luke Danes, the great communicator, you're going to straighten the kid out?",2
LUKE,"All he needs is a change of pace, a new crowd, and to get away from the nutjob that, unfortunately, is my sister.",2
LORELAI,"Well, how long is he staying?",2
LUKE,I don't know. Indefinitely.,2
LORELAI,And how old is he?,2
LUKE,Seventeen.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, wow. That is very generous of you.",2
LUKE,"Well, it's family, what else can you do?",2
LORELAI,Right. So what kind of trouble has he gotten into?,2
LUKE,"Ah, just kid stuff, you know, staying out late, getting rowdy. I don't know exactly.",2
LORELAI,"Well, you might want to find out. Ask a couple of subtle questions, you know, has he seen The Shawshank Redemption, did the setting seem homey to him? Stuff like that.",2
LUKE,"Look, his problem is obvious, it's his mother. You never could count on Liz for anything. Our mom died when we were kids, right? It was just my dad, me and Liz. And my dad worked all the time an d I worked in the store with my dad, and Liz was off doing God knows what.",2
LORELAI,"Well, I bet losing her mom so early was kind of hard on her.",2
LUKE,"It was hard on all of us, but we did our part. And then the minute she graduates high school, she is outta here. Didn't matter that my dad was sick, didn't matter that the store was failing, she just took off. Married the hot dog king, had a kid, he left, now here we are.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, wow, that's I'm sorry, what are you doing?",2
LUKE,I'm blowing this up.,2
LORELAI,What is it?,2
LUKE,It's a bed.,2
LORELAI,A bed?,2
LUKE,For Jess.,2
LORELAI,Jess?,2
LUKE,"Jess, my nephew.",2
LORELAI,"Luke, um, that's not a bed, that's a raft, which is fine if you're gonna build a moat aroundthe diner but ",2
LUKE,It's fine.,2
LORELAI,"Luke, the kid needs a bed. If you want to get him something inflatable, make it a blonde.",2
LUKE,"I'm getting him a bed, this is just temporary.",2
LORELAI,"Hey, how does Jess feel about this?",2
LUKE,I don't know.,2
LORELAI,You haven't talked to him about it?,2
LUKE,No.,2
LORELAI,Don't you think you should?,2
LUKE,"Why? He doesn't have a choice. His mom's a flake, he's coming here, end of story.",2
LORELAI,Are you sure you're ready for this?,2
LUKE,Of course I'm sure.,2
LORELAI,"I mean, taking on a full time kid, that's a lot of work.",2
LUKE,I know.,2
LORELAI,"And a seventeen-year-old that's been getting into trouble and now is being shipped off without his consent, that could be even harder.",2
LUKE,"Look, all he needs is to be around someone who's not a selfish basketcase, who will give him a little space, who will treat him like a man.",2
LORELAI,Maybe you should think about this.,2
LUKE,"There's nothing to think about. He's family. You take care of family, period.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, I respect that, but what if he turns out to be Fredo?",2
LUKE,Are you seriously telling me not to do this?,2
LORELAI,"No, I'm not telling you not to do this.",2
LUKE,Then what are you saying?,2
LORELAI,"I'm just saying that if you need any help, I'm here.",2
LUKE,Thank you.,2
LORELAI,You're welcome.,2
LUKE,"Look, I got a lot of things to do before he gets here so ",2
LORELAI,"Okay, I'm leaving. Oh, you do have an extra set of sheets, right?",2
LUKE,"Yes, I do.",2
LORELAI,"Sorry, just checking. Bye.",2
LUKE,,2
RORY,,2
RORY,Five seconds?,2
PARIS,Four.,2
RORY,Fine.,2
PARIS,Now it's three.,2
RORY,"Paris, it does not have to be like this.",2
PARIS,No?,2
RORY,You and I are going to have to spend a lot of time in class together on The Franklin.,2
PARIS,I know.,2
RORY,"We're gonna have to sit in the same classroom, share the same oxygen, occasionally make eye contact.",2
PARIS,I can avoid that.,2
RORY,"Look, I'm not saying that we should be friends. I don't want to be friends. I'm just saying that maybe we should look at this like life.",2
PARIS,Life?,2
RORY,"Yes, in life there will be people that you don't like, but that you have to coexist with.",2
PARIS,I am well aware of that.,2
RORY,So I'm just suggesting that we coexist.,2
PARIS,"You're just scared that I'm gonna make your life on The Franklin a living hell. Especially since I'm the editor and you're oh, what's the word not.",2
RORY,"If you want to spend the precious energy that you'd normally spend on the paper obsessing on ways to make me mis erable, then that's your choice. I'm just suggesting an alternate plan. The paper could be really great this year.",2
PARIS,I know.,2
RORY,"So, can't we just agree on that and make all the rest of it go away?",2
LOUISE,Everything okay?,2
RORY,"Yeah, Riff, everything's fine.",2
PARIS,We were just talking.,2
MADELINE,Talking? You two?,2
PARIS,About The Franklin.,2
MADELINE,"Oh. Nope, still seems weird.",2
PARIS,"Hey, look, we're all on the paper together. There's gonna be a lot of long afternoons and weekends.",2
LOUISE,Weekends?,2
PARIS,"We need to coexist, right?",2
RORY,Right.,2
LOUISE,I'm sorry. Back up to the weekends.,2
PARIS,So that's what we'll do. Now the first meeting of The Franklin is today.,2
RORY,Yes it is.,2

JESS,Huh.,2
LUKE,Belonged to your Grandpa.,2
JESS,Huh.,2
LUKE,,2
LUKE,"Well, here we are. It's pretty simple. You know, this is the room. That's my bed, that's your, uh, bed for now, but the sheets are new. There's the bathroom, there's the closet, there's the dresser, the phone, and over there is the kitchen. I've got Frosted Flakes.",2
JESS,"Wow, that's grrrrreat.",2
LUKE,"So, is that all your stuff?",2
JESS,Yup.,2
LUKE,Not much there.,2
JESS,"Well, Lizzie's sending the rest later.",2
LUKE,"So, you need some help?",2
JESS,Nope.,2

TEACHERory,"No, we start at 3:15 sharp.",2
PARIS,"Look, we're wasting time here.",2
TEACHERory,Take a seat Miss Gilmore.,2
RORY,Sorry.,2
PARIS,"Okay, so we were just finishing up handing out the first assignments. Now, Rory, unfortunately, since you got here so late, most everything of interest has been given out.",2
RORY,"Why, I'm shocked.",2
PARIS,"Wait, wait, just let me check my list here. There might be something left for you. Okay, well, here, they're paving the new parking lot tomorrow.",2
RORY,And?,2
PARIS,And you can cover it.,2
RORY,Cover what?,2
PARIS,The paving process.,2
RORY,You're serious?,2
PARIS,Absolutely. I'm sure there's an angle there somewhere. Is it environmentally safe? What are the financial ramifications? Should brick have been considered especially taking into account the architecture of the building?,2
RORY,"Yeah yeah, I get the idea.",2
PARIS,"But hey, if you think this is below you, you can always wait until the next issue. You can just use this time to get a nice manicure.",2
RORY,That's okay.,2
PARIS,Maybe get a massage.,2
RORY,I'll do it.,2
PARIS,Aromatherapy. Smell like a peach for a few days.,2
RORY,"I said I'll do it, okay? I'll cover the paving.",2
PARIS,"Okay, good. Well then, I guess that's it.",2
PARIS,"Problem, Miss Gilmore?",2
RORY,"Nope, no problem at all. I love this assignment.",2
PARIS,I'm glad.,2
RORY,I'm gonna write the greatest piece on pavement you've ever read.,2
PARIS,I hope so.,2
RORY,"And next week, when you give me the scoop on the new copper plumbing installation, I'm gonna be just as thrilled.",2
PARIS,I like a team player.,2
RORY,"And no matter how many crappy, stupid, useless assignments you throw at me, I'm not going to quit and I'm not going to back down. So you can go home tonight and think about the fact that no matter what you do and no matter how evil you are, at the end of the year, on my high school transcript, it's going to say that I worked on The Franklin. So, if you'll excuse me, I have some reading to do on the origins of concrete.",2
PARIS,,2
LORELAI,Hey.,2
LUKE,Oh geez.,2
LORELAI,Sorry.,2
LUKE,"No, I'll just you want some coffee?",2
LORELAI,It's okay. I'll just lick it off the table. So?,2
LUKE,So what?,2
LORELAI,Is he here?,2
LUKE,He's here.,2
LORELAI,Yeah? How is he?,2
LUKE,He's fine.,2
LORELAI,Did he see the bed?,2
LUKE,He saw the bed.,2
LORELAI,"Well, where is he? I wanna meet him.",2
LUKE,"Oh, he's out.",2
LORELAI,Out where?,2
LUKE,I don't know.,2
LORELAI,You don't?,2
LUKE,"No, he just went out.",2
LORELAI,You didn't ask him where he was going?,2
LUKE,No.,2
LORELAI,Why not?,2
LUKE,Because he's not two.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, but Luke, he's new in town. He doesn't know his way around yet.",2
LUKE,Way around what? This is Stars Hollow. You take three left turns and you're back in the center of town.,2
LORELAI,"Luke, when a kid goes out, you have to at least ask where he's going.",2
LUKE,Why?,2
LORELAI,"Because you're responsible for him now. If he goes and knocks over a liquor store, it's gonna be your fault.",2
LUKE,"If I had asked him where he was going and he actually intended to knock off a liquor store, do you really think he would've told me that?",2
LORELAI,If he's dumb.,2
LUKE,He's fine. New topic.,2
LUKE,"Jess, hey, good. I'd like you to meet someone.",2
LORELAI,"Hey. Hi, I'm Lorelai. I just wanted to meet you before Luke had a chance to fill your head with all kinds of little lies about me.",2
JESS,Hi.,2
LORELAI,"You know, you should meet my daughter. She's about your age. She can show you where all the good wilding goes on. . . .Okay, well, it's nice to meet you. I hope you like it here. . . . . So, class dismissed.",2
LUKE,"Uh, are you hungry 'cause I can ",2
LORELAI,So that's Jess?,2
LUKE,Yup.,2
LORELAI,Very chatty.,2
LUKE,"He's adjusting. He just got here. He probably just went out and realized there are twelve stores in this town devoted entirely to peddling porcelain unicorns. I've lived in this town my entire life, I still can't believe it.",2
LORELAI,I'm sure that's it.,2
LUKE,He'll be fine in a few days.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, listen, I have a fabulous idea. What are you doing tomorrow night?",2
LUKE,Why?,2
LORELAI,Why don't you and Jess come over for dinner?,2
LUKE,Dinner?,2
LORELAI,"Sookie will cook, Rory will be there. It'll be a little 'Hey, welcome to Stars Hollow and see, everyone here's not straight out of a Fellini film' kind of an evening.",2
LUKE,"Okay, that would be nice, thanks.",2
LORELAI,You're welcome.,2
LUKE,You won't bring up the bed?,2
LORELAI,"Oh no, I'll definitely bring up the bed.",2
RORY,"Oh my God, I hate her.",2
LORELAI,"Ah, me too.",2
RORY,You have no idea who I'm talking about.,2
LORELAI,Solidarity sister.,2
RORY,Paris.,2
LORELAI,"Ugh. Well, that I should've guessed.",2
RORY,She thinks she can t*rture me off the paper and she can't.,2
LORELAI,"No, she can't.",2
RORY,I have never met anyone like her before. Her insistence on holding onto this stupid grudge that is based on nothing and will never ever end shows an amount of commit ment that I would've never thought possible. I'm beginning to admire her.,2
LORELAI,First day sucked?,2
RORY,"Just the paper stuff sucked, the rest of the stuff was good.",2
LORELAI,"Good, I'm glad to hear it. Did you happen to run into Max?",2
RORY,"Actually, no.",2
LORELAI,Really?,2
RORY,"Yeah, our paths just didn't cross.",2
LORELAI,Isn't he your Lit teacher?,2
RORY,"Yeah, but I do have really tall people sitting in front of me.",2
LORELAI,Rory.,2
RORY,I saw him in the hallway and I walked the other way and ,2
LORELAI,Why?,2
RORY,I don't know. I thought that's what you'd want me to do.,2
LORELAI,"Just because Max isn't apart of my life anymore doesn't mean he can't be apart of yours. He has to be apart of yours. You have to see him and talk to him, and that's okay. That's good. I know everything seems screwed up right now, but I don't want you to avoid him, especially not on my account. Okay?",2
RORY,All right.,2
LORELAI,I am sorry that I put you in this position.,2
RORY,That's okay. It's going on the list.,2
LORELAI,"My God, that list is getting long.",2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,We are having a little gathering tomorrow night.,2
RORY,What kind of gathering?,2
LORELAI,"Well, Luke's nephew's here, and I thought we could try to make him feel a little more at home.",2
RORY,Did you meet him?,2
LORELAI,Sort of.,2
RORY,What's he like?,2
LORELAI,,2
LUKE,So you get unpacked?,2
JESS,Yup.,2
LUKE,Get enough space in the closet?,2
JESS,Plenty.,2
LUKE,You hungry?,2
JESS,Eighteen.,2
LUKE,What?,2
JESS,Just counting how many questions 'til we hit twenty.,2
LUKE,"Okay, never mind. Yeah? Yeah, Liz, he got here fine.",2
JESS,Got here at ten this morning.,2
LUKE,"Okay, hang on a sec. Jess?",2
JESS,Pass.,2
LUKE,"Jess, come on.",2
JESS,Nope.,2
LUKE,What am I supposed to tell her?,2
JESS,"Tell her I gotta take another crack at that closet. You know, I think I hung my Tool T-shirt next to my Metallica T-shirt and they don't really get along.",2
LUKE,You really want me to tell her that?,2
JESS,You think a different band combo would sell it more?,2
LUKE,"Yeah, Liz, Jess is gonna have to call you back. Yeah, he's helping me out with a shelf thing and his hand are full Yeah, I'll tell him. Okay, bye. She said to tell you that your stuff will be here on Friday.",2
JESS,"Great, we'll have a party.",2
LUKE,"You know, your mom thinks this is. . .you know, for the best and for your own good and. . . Anyhow, I guess you'll just call her when you feel like it.",2
JESS,You wanna play some poker? Five bucks a hand?,2
LUKE,No.,2
JESS,Ten?,2
LUKE,No.,2
JESS,I can't go any higher than ten.,2
LUKE,Jess.,2
JESS,"Okay, fifteen",2
LUKE,"Yeah, I don't wanna play poker.",2
JESS,You sure?,2
LUKE,I'm sure.,2
JESS,Okie dokie.,2
LUKE,,2
PARIS,"Oh, hello.",2
RORY,Hi.,2
PARIS,You're early.,2
RORY,"Yeah, well I felt so bad about the mix up last time, I wanted to make sure it didn't happen again. It won't.",2
MADELINE,"Hey, did you hear that Kimber Slately and Tristin are a major item?",2
LOUISE,I thought that Kimber and Shawn Asher were this year's John and Jackie.,2
MADELINE,"Nope, Shawn is with Deeds McGuire now, which pushed Jeff Trainer into Dottie Lords' arms leaving Madison Maylands alone for the first weekend since he became captain of the lacrosse team.",2
LOUISE,"Wow, you know so much so soon. You have a gift.",2
MADELINE,"I know. Hey Paris, what do you think about me writing a gossip column for The Franklin?",2
PARIS,"Huh. I don't know. That's a hard one. I mean, this is The Franklin, a newspaper that's been around for almost a hundred years. There have been at least ten former editors of The Franklin that have gone on to work at the New York Times. Six have gone onto the Washington Post. Three are contributing editors at the New Yorker. I think one even went on to win the Pullitzer Prize. But never mind them. I could be the first editor in the history of The Franklin to introduce a column exclusively devoted to who Biffy's boffing today. Quandary. You know, I'm gonna have to get back to you on that one.",2
MADELINE,Okay.,2
TEACHERory,"Oh good, we're all here. And prompt, lovely. Well, I've read everyone's article, and they were all extremely well done. Snappy, informative, well-researched. Paris, you should be very proud of the team you've assembled here this year.",2
PARIS,Thank you.,2
TEACHERory,"I mean, when you've got a reporter who can take an incredibly mundane and seemingly unimportant subject like the re-paving of the faculty parking lot and turn it into a bittersweet piece on how everybody and everything eventually becomes obsolete, then you've really got something. Miss Gilmore, I was touched.",2
RORY,I owe it all to Paris.,2
TEACHERory,I would strongly advise that next time you give Miss Gilmore something with a little more meat to it.,2
PARIS,"Oh, yeah, great idea.",2
TEACHERory,"Okay, let's get down to work here. We've got a layout to put together.",2
PARIS,"Well, congratulations.",2
RORY,Thank you.,2
PARIS,You must be very proud of yourself.,2
RORY,"Well, I'm not hiding when I pass a mirror.",2
PARIS,"I guess it's part of my job as editor to make sure that our best writer's are writing our best pieces, so I'm going to give you one of our best pieces.",2
RORY,Uh huh.,2
PARIS,"Front page, lead story, above the fold.",2
RORY,Get to the catch Paris.,2
PARIS,No catch.,2
RORY,No catch?,2
PARIS,"I'd like to start out year off with a profile on the teacher voted most popular from the year before. You know, an in-depth, no holds barred interview. Everybody wants it. You have it.",2
RORY,You're kidding.,2
PARIS,Nope.,2
RORY,"Well, thanks.",2
PARIS,You're welcome. So go ahead and set up that interview with Mr. Medina as soon as possible.,2
RORY,What?,2
PARIS,I know it's short notice but I'd love it to lead off the first edition.,2
RORY,Mr. Medina?,2
PARIS,He was the winner by a landslide.,2
RORY,But ,2
PARIS,"I'm sorry, is there a problem? I mean, is there some reason why you wouldn't want to interview him? After all, you of all people should be able to get the most in-depth story out of him, especially since he and your mother are involved. They are still involved, aren't they?",2
RORY,"Let's just leave my mother's personal life out of this, okay?",2
PARIS,"Oh, that sounds bad.",2
RORY,"It's not bad, it's just none of your business.",2
PARIS,Fine. You want the interview or not?,2
RORY,"Yes, I want the interview.",2
PARIS,,2
SOOKIE,Maybe I should make grilled cheese.,2
JACKSON,But you're making pot roast.,2
SOOKIE,But not everybody likes pot roast.,2
JACKSON,"Well, then they can have the chicken wings, the mashed potatoes, the four different kinds of salad that you're making in addition to the pot roast.",2
SOOKIE,"Yeah, I guess you're right.",2
JACKSON,So I should start slicing the cheese?,2
SOOKIE,"Would you? Oh, that'd be great.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, wow, something smells good.",2
SOOKIE,It's the garlic.,2
JACKSON,Three heads of it.,2
LORELAI,Nice.,2
SOOKIE,I want everything to be perfect. We are gonna make this kid think that he died and went to heaven.,2
JACKSON,Or Henry the Eighth's house.,2
LORELAI,Milady?,2
RORY,Come in .,2
LORELAI,"Hey, you joining the festivities?",2
RORY,In a sec.,2
LORELAI,You sound crabby.,2
RORY,I'm concentrating.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, don't concentrate too hard. Boys like 'em dumb, right Jackson?",2
JACKSON,"If you can navigate yourself around a tree, keep on walking.",2
LORELAI,Coming!,2
SOOKIE,,2
LORELAI,"Hey, perfect timing. Sookie's about to break her own record for the most food served outside the Roman Empire.",2
LUKE,Sounds great.,2
JESS,Sure does.,2
LORELAI,"So, come on in.",2
LUKE,Sorry we're a little late. We had a little misunderstanding about what time we're actually supposed to leave to come here.,2
LORELAI,It's okay. How's it going?,2
LUKE,"Oh, well, not bad. Oh, the bed popped.",2
LORELAI,Yikes. Was anyone in it?,2
LUKE,Me.,2
LORELAI,You?,2
LUKE,"Yeah, I let him take the real one.",2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,"Sookie, Jackson, I want you to meet Luke's nephew. This is Jess.",2
SOOKIE,Do you eat cheese?,2
JESS,What?,2
JACKSON,"Oh my God, this is the greatest lemon I have ever grown. I mean, this is a great lemon. Sookie, you gotta try this lemon. Isn't it a great lemon?",2
SOOKIE,That is a great lemon.,2
JACKSON,"Try it, it's a Meyer.",2
LORELAI,"Jackson grows fruit and then scares people with it. Rory, they're here.",2
RORY,Coming. Hey.,2
JESS,Hey.,2
RORY,I'm Rory.,2
JESS,"Yeah, I figured.",2
RORY,Nice to meet you.,2
JESS,"Wow, aren't we hooked on phonics.",2
RORY,"Oh, I read a lot. Do you read?",2
JESS,Not much.,2
RORY,I could loan you that if you want. It's great.,2
JESS,No thanks.,2
RORY,"Well, if you change your mind ",2
LORELAI,"Okay, we really need to get Jackson away from the lemons now, so we're moving the feast in the living room.",2
RORY,Be right there.,2
JESS,So do these open?,2
RORY,"Oh yeah, you just have to unlatch them and then push.",2
JESS,Great. Shall we?,2
RORY,Shall we what?,2
JESS,Bail.,2
RORY,No.,2
JESS,Why?,2
RORY,Because it's Tuesday night in Stars Hollow. There's nowhere to bail to. The 24-hour mini-mart just closed twenty minutes ago.,2
JESS,So we'll walk around or sit on a bench and stare at our shoes.,2
RORY,"Look, Sookie just made a ton of really great food, and I'm starving and though it may not seem like it right at this moment, it's gonna be fun. Trust me.",2
JESS,I don't even know you.,2
RORY,"Well, don't I look trustworthy?",2
JESS,Maybe.,2
RORY,"Okay, good. Let's eat. You want a soda?",2
JESS,"Oh, I'll get it.",2
RORY,,2
SOOKIE,You know ham was originally made out of rice?,2
JACKSON,What?,2
SOOKIE,Mm hmm.,2
LORELAI,Sookie ,2
LUKE,"Hey Rory, where's Jess?",2
RORY,He's getting a soda.,2
LORELAI,Here.,2
LUKE,"I'm sorry, you must've mistaken me for you.",2
LORELAI,"Ooh, too much?",2
SOOKIE,"Oh, I forgot the garlic bread.",2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,"Oh, for me, hey, thanks. Refreshing. So what, you're not hungry?",2
JESS,Not really.,2
LORELAI,"Well, Sookie made you some grilled cheese if you don't like pot roast.",2
JESS,"Oh, well, if I'd had known that ",2
LORELAI,"Let me guess, you don't want to be here?",2
JESS,Doesn't matter.,2
LORELAI,"I mean, here in Stars Hollow.",2
JESS,"Well geez, Ms. Gilmore, why would anyone not want to be here in Stars Hollow? That just sounds plum crazy.",2
LORELAI,"Ugh, Jess, let me give you a little advice. The whole 'my parents don't get me' thing, I've been there.",2
JESS,"You have, huh?",2
LORELAI,"Yes, I have. I've also done the 'chip on my shoulder' bit. Ooh, and the surly, sarcastic, 'the world can bite my ass' bit, and let me tell you, I mastered them all, in heels, yet. And everything you're feeling might be totally justified, maybe you are getting screwed. But Luke is a great guy. He's very special, and he really wants to take care of you and make things right for you. You're incredibly lucky to have him. If you give this situation half a chance, you might be surprised at how good it can be, how much you like living here, and how comfortable it feels to have someone like Luke you can really depend on.",2
JESS,What are you sleeping with him or something?,2
LORELAI,Excuse me?,2
JESS,"I don't know. The whole starry eyed 'you're so much better off, just give it a chance' speech. You're either really naïve, or you're getting some.",2
LORELAI,"Ugh. There have been very few moments in my life where I have actually wished I had one of those enormous cream pies you can just smash in someone's face, but this is definitely one of them.",2
JESS,"Well, now, that's not very neighborly.",2
LORELAI,"Hey, you know what, this is my house, and I choose how I get talked to in it, ha ha.",2
JESS,"You know, you don't know anything about me, or my life, or my mom, or Luke, so why don't you Doctor Laura someone else.",2
LORELAI,,2
LUKE,Where's Jess?,2
LORELAI,"Outside working on his ""Breakfast Club"" audition. He's getting good.",2
LUKE,What?,2
LORELAI,"Luke, I'm sorry. That kid is way more screwed up than you think he is.",2
LUKE,What are you talking about?,2
LORELAI,"I catch him outside with a beer, I don't even bust him on it, I just I try talking to him ",2
LUKE,"What do you mean, talk to him? What did you say?",2
LORELAI,"I said he's got a good thing going here with you and he shouldn't blow it, and then, well then he just got charming.",2
LUKE,What are you doing talking to him about stuff like that?,2
LORELAI,I'm trying to help you.,2
LUKE,I don't need your help.,2
LORELAI,"Uh, yeah you do.",2
LUKE,"Oh, here we go again with this 'I'm not prepared for this' crap.",2
LORELAI,"This is not crap, this is the truth. Luke, you should've heard him talking.",2
LUKE,"I don't need to hear him talking, he's my nephew and I know what I'm doing. And I'm getting a little tired of your condescending ",2
LORELAI,I am not being condescending.,2
LUKE,"Oh, you have a kid, so you know everything, right?",2
LORELAI,"I have a kid, so yeah, I know a little more than you do.",2
LUKE,"You know, you ever think maybe you just got lucky with Rory? I mean, you did get pregnant at sixteen. That doesn't show the greatest decision making skills, now does it?",2
LORELAI,"Wow, two pies.",2
LUKE,What the hell you talking about?,2
LORELAI,"Nothing. I'm talking about nothing. And you won't have to hear my opinion on anything ever again, okay?",2
LUKE,"Oh, don't tease.",2
LORELAI,Go find Jess.,2
LUKE,,2
RORY,You're being completely childish.,2
LORELAI,Am not.,2
RORY,"So what, we're never gonna go into Luke's again? We're just gonna starve?",2
LORELAI,"Rory, this was a bad one, okay? This was not Nick and Nora, this was Sid and Nancy, and I'm not going in there.",2
RORY,But the coffee is in there. And it's Danish Day. Are you seriously telling me that you're gonna let a stupid fight get in the way of Danish Day?,2
LORELAI,"No, I'm not.",2
RORY,Good.,2
LORELAI,So go in there and order two coffees and two Danishes to go.,2
RORY,"You're kidding, right?",2
LORELAI,And don't forget the napkins.,2
RORY,"Mom, he's gonna know what's going on. He's not stupid.",2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,Hey Luke.,2
LUKE,Rory.,2
RORY,"Um, I'll have two coffees and two cherry Danishes to go, please.",2
LUKE,Two coffees and two cherry Danishes.,2
RORY,"Oh, and some napkins.",2
LUKE,One of these is for her isn't it?,2
RORY,"Who? Oh, no no no. They're all for me. I am super hungry today. I was debating ordering three, but I'll tell you how I feel after two.",2
LUKE,"Tell you what, I'll give you one Danish and one cup of coffee, you can sit over there and eat, and when you're finished them right over there where I can see you, then I'll bring you a second one.",2
RORY,You're really just gonna stand there and watch me eat a Danish?,2
LUKE,Cable's out. I'm starved for entertainment.,2
RORY,"Okay, this is insane. So you guys had a fight, big deal. You know you're gonna make up anyway, and what better day to make up than Danish Day, the happiest of all days. The day when we all say, 'hey, let's forgive and forget over a nice Danish and a cup coffee.'",2
LUKE,"One Danish, one cup of coffee, take it or leave it.",2
RORY,I'll take it. I still think you're being silly.,2
LUKE,,2
LORELAI,Well?,2
RORY,He would only sell me one.,2
LORELAI,Ugh! Didn't you say they were both for you?,2
RORY,"Yes I did, and he knew that I was lying.",2
LORELAI,Did you do the blinky thing? You always do the blinky thing when you're lying.,2
RORY,I didn't have to do the blinky thing. He knows you well enough to know that you're not gonna go a whole day with no coffee and especially no Danish.,2
LORELAI,Ugh!,2
RORY,Why don't you go in there now and just make up?,2
LORELAI,Why don't you give me half your Danish and some coffee?,2
RORY,I'll give you the Danish but I'm keeping the coffee.,2
LORELAI,What is a Danish without coffee?,2
RORY,The eternal question springs up again.,2
LORELAI,There's no point in even eating a Danish without coffee.,2
RORY,I'm going to school.,2
LORELAI,"Sad Danish, lonely Danish, step Danish.",2
RORY,I'll see you tonight.,2
LORELAI,"But  Hey, kid, do me a favor? Come here.",2
LORELAI,"Please, please ",2
LUKE,,2
RORY,Hi.,2
MAX,"Rory, hi.",2
RORY,Am I too early? 'Cause I can ,2
MAX,"No, no.",2
RORY, come back some other time.,2
MAX,This is fine.,2
RORY,Tomorrow maybe.,2
MAX,Now is good.,2
RORY,This is weird.,2
MAX,"Yeah, it is.",2
RORY,I don't really know how to act.,2
MAX,I'm not completely sure of that myself. We could sit.,2
RORY,"Sit, sure, that's good. Barbara Walters sits, or walks sometimes if the person she's talking to has a horse or a ranch or a big backyard sometimes, but usually she just sits. Okay, so I guess we should just start.",2
MAX,Good idea.,2
RORY,Do you mind if I tape this?,2
MAX,"Oh, no, not at all.",2
RORY,Okay. So I guess I'll just dive in. Full name?,2
MAX,Max Arturo Medina.,2
RORY,You're kidding.,2
MAX,"No, I'm not.",2
RORY,Where does that come from?,2
MAX,My father's butcher was named Arturo.,2
RORY,Really?,2
MAX,"And when my mother was pregnant with me, she went through this phase where all she would eat was lamb chops. So Arturo would cut her the extra large lamb chops and only charge her for the regular sized lamb chops, which in my family made you eligible for sainthood.",2
RORY,Hence the Arturo.,2
MAX,That's right.,2
RORY,"Well, I assume that you are aware that you were overwhelmingly voted the student's favorite teacher last year.",2
MAX,I teach an exceptional bunch of young people. I'm glad they seem to like me as much as I like them.,2
RORY,Have you ever thought of doing something other than teaching?,2
MAX,"Well, my father wanted me to be a doctor, and my mother wanted me to be President, and I wanted to be. . . a clown.",2
RORY,What?,2
MAX,"When I was a kid, I went to the circus and I saw this man who was dressed in this crazy outfit, and he could juggle and he rode on an elephant and the people loved him and I thought, 'Well, that's it. That's for me.'",2
RORY,How long did that last?,2
MAX,"Junior high. And then slowly I figured out that I wanted to teach. Plus, when you told people that you wanted to be a clown they tended to get very frightened.",2
RORY,"Mom took me to the circus once, when I was really little and, um, this clown knocked into me an d I dropped my cotton candy, and we didn't have a lot of money back then so she couldn't buy me an other one, and I started crying. So she literally chased the clown on stage, ripped off his wig and said she wouldn't give it back to him unless he bought me another cotton candy.",2
MAX,Which I bet he did.,2
RORY,It was twice as big as the first one and I threw up all the way home.,2
MAX,"Yeah, that sounds like your mom.",2
RORY,Do you ever regret the fact that you didn't become a clown?,2
MAX,"I don't really believe in regrets. All my experiences, even the ones that didn't turn out the way I wanted them to, I firmly believe they were all worth it.",2
RORY,"I just want you to know, I really wanted you to be my stepfather.",2
MAX,"I just want you to know, I really wanted to be your stepfather.",2
RORY,"So, what would you say are the great challenges facing high school graduates today?",2
MAX,,2
LUKE,Hey. How was school?,2
JESS,Great.,2
LUKE,You learn anything good?,2
JESS,"Oh yeah, tons of things. I've got gold stars plastered all over my forehead.",2
LUKE,I had an interesting call today. Wanna know who it was from?,2
JESS,Not really.,2
LUKE,"It was from Taylor Doose, you know he owns the market.",2
JESS,If you say so.,2
LUKE,He said you came in today.,2
JESS,He did?,2
LUKE,"And he said you took some mo ney out of a little donation cup to help repair the bridge. I told him he was crazy, you wouldn't do that, you weren't a thief, that he was just trying to start trouble, then I hung up on him. But don't get me wrong, I enjoy hanging up on Taylor, and he is crazy, but I was just wondering if maybe any of the other things he said were true.",2
JESS,What do you think?,2
LUKE,"I think that if you tell me that what he's saying is not true, then I'm gonna believe it's not true.",2
JESS,"Okay, it's not true.",2
LUKE,That doesn't sound very convincing.,2
JESS,"Look, what exactly do you want from me? You bring me here to this place, you put me in a school that says the Pledge of Allegiance in six different languages, two of which I've never heard of before. You take me aw ay from my home, my friends, and now you want what from me?",2
LUKE,I'm trying to help you.,2
JESS,"Well, stop trying. Stop talking to me, stop following me, and stop asking me questions. Just stop.",2
LUKE,That's what you want?,2
JESS,Yes.,2
LUKE,That's really what you want?,2
JESS,Yes.,2
LUKE,"Fine, you got it.",2
JESS,Thank you.,2
LUKE,,2
LORELAI,Rory?,2
RORY,Kitchen.,2
LORELAI,"Nowhere in either Stars Hollow or it's surrounding counties can you get a decent cup of coffee. I swear, it's like a big stupid coffee conspiracy.",2
RORY,Why don't you just pour the water right into the bag?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, you jest, but believe me, the thought has crossed my mind. It's looking better and better all the time. Where are you going? I'm not through complaining.",2
RORY,I just have to get some mo re notes I need.,2
LORELAI,Hmm. What's this?,2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,This that you're working on?,2
RORY,"Oh, that's my interview with Max.",2
LORELAI,What interview with Max?,2
RORY,The paper wanted to do a piece on the student's favorite teacher from the previous year and Paris assigned it to me w hen she caught wind of the fact that. . .,2
LORELAI,"Wow, nice kid that Paris.",2
RORY,Yeah. It wasn't that bad though.,2
LORELAI,No?,2
RORY,No. It was actually good. It gave us a chance to talk about some things.,2
LORELAI,Well good.,2
RORY,"Yeah, it was good. Well, I'm gonna buy a folder for it before the store closes.",2
LORELAI,"Okay. Some good writing here, missy.",2
RORY,Yeah?,2
LORELAI,Really good.,2
RORY,It's not quite up to the re-paving piece yet but I'll get it there.,2
LORELAI,"Hmm. Boy, he sounds like a hell of a guy, doesn't he?",2
RORY,"Yeah, he does.",2
LORELAI,"I sure know how to dump 'em, don't I?",2
LORELAI,Hey.,2
LUKE,I just pushed him in a lake.,2
LORELAI,What?,2
LUKE,Jess. I got this call from Taylor that he thinks Jess stole the bridge money and I went to confront him and he was being impossible and I just pushed him in a lake. This is bad.,2
LORELAI,"That depends, can he swim?",2
LUKE,"He's fine. He's wet. I just, I lost it, you know. You were right. I am in so far over my head that I can't see my own hat.",2
LORELAI,Try turning it around,2
LUKE,What was I thinking? Why did I say yes to this?,2
LORELAI,Because you saw a kid in desperate need of some help and you thought you would throw him a line.,2
LUKE,"But me, raising a kid? I don't even like kids. They're always sticky, you know, like they've got jam on their hands. Even if there's no jam in the house, somehow they've always got jam on their hands. I'm not the right guy to deal with that. I have no patience for jam hands.",2
LORELAI,"Luke, slow down. First of all, Jess is seventeen, so I think he's probably past the jam hands stage by now. And second of all, you can do this. If you want to, you are totally capable. But you can't just buy a bed and some sheets and expect the rest to take care of itself. That will not work.",2
LUKE,"I swear, I'm gonna k*ll Liz.",2
LORELAI,"Hey, Liz is not the point anymore. Liz is not here, Jess is here. Focus on him. What are you gonna do about him?",2
BABETTE,"Lorelai, sugah? I hate to bother you, but have you seen Pierpont?",2
LORELAI,Um no. Why?,2
BABETTE,It's the darndest thing. I came out just now and I noticed that he was gone. Just like that.,2
LUKE,"I'm sorry, who's missing?",2
BABETTE,"Pierpont, gorgeous.",2
LORELAI,Her gnome.,2
LUKE,Her gnome?,2
BABETTE,The one with the pipe.,2
LUKE,Oh.,2
BABETTE,"Oh God, I hope nothing's happened to him. You get so attached to their little faces, sometimes you can hear them talk to you at night.",2
LUKE,"You know, I wouldn't worry Babette. I think you're gonna see Pierpont again really soon.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, where you going?",2
LUKE,"I have to take care of something. I'll see you tomorrow at the diner for your Danish, right?",2
LORELAI,Tomorrow isn't Danish Day.,2
LUKE,Just be there.,2
LORELAI,,2
LUKE,"Okay, we got the patch, the gum, hypnosis tapes, Chinese herbs, self-help books, and several pictures of diseased lungs to hang on the fridge. Pretty, huh? This is done.",2
JESS,Hey!,2
LUKE,"You will get up, you will go to school, you will come home, you will work in the diner until closing, you will do your homework and then you will go to bed. Where's the gnome?",2
JESS,The what?,2
LUKE,"The weekends are for chores and selected pre-approved outings, i.e. cavalla studies, freeway beautification projects, Color Me Mine pottery painting, all discussible options. You will not steal, you will pay back Taylor Doose, you will graduate for high school, and you will return Pierpont to his yard.",2
JESS,You can't just ,2
LUKE,"I can just. I am not letting you just fall off the face of the earth. You will not drift, I won't let it happen. Now I don't know if this is the right way to handle this, but this is the way it's being handled, and that my friend, is the end of this discussion. Where are you going?",2
JESS,Out.,2
LUKE,,2
JESS,Hey.,2
RORY,Hey yourself.,2
JESS,What are you doing out here?,2
RORY,I needed something for school. What about you?,2
JESS,"Oh yeah, same thing.",2
RORY,"Uh huh. So, that was quite a disappearing act you pulled the other night.",2
JESS,Potlucks and Tupperware parties aren't really my thing.,2
RORY,"Too cool for school, huh?",2
JESS,"Yes, that is me.",2
RORY,What are you doing?,2
JESS,Oh this? Nothing. Just another little disappearing act.,2
RORY,Little tip?,2
JESS,Yeah?,2
RORY,"If you ever want to speak to me again, don't pull that out of my ear.",2
JESS,So I assume the nose is off limits too?,2
RORY,"Any place you wouldn't naturally find a coin, let's leave it that way.",2
JESS,So what are you doing now?,2
RORY,I have some homework to finish.,2
JESS,"Okay, then I'll leave you this last little trick.",2
RORY,,2
JESS,It is yours.,2
RORY,You stole my book.,2
JESS,"Nope, borrowed it.",2
RORY,"Okay, that's not called a trick, that's called a felony.",2
JESS,I just wanted to put some notes in the margins for you.,2
RORY,What? You've read this before.,2
JESS,About forty times.,2
RORY,I thought you said you didn't read much.,2
JESS,"Well, what is much? Goodnight Rory.",2
RORY,Goodnight Dodger.,2
JESS,Dodger?,2
RORY,Figure it out.,2
JESS,,2

MAID,Yes?,2
LORELAI,Hey.,2
MAID,Hello.,2
LORELAI,You're new.,2
MAID,"Uh, I started yesterday.",2
LORELAI,What's your name?,2
MAID,Liesl.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, Liesl. I'm Brigitta, this is Gretl. And, uh, Emily and Richard are expecting us.",2
LIESLorelai,"Oh, I'm sorry. Please come in .",2
LIESLorelai,"Uh, can I, uh, get you a drink?",2
LORELAI,"You know what, that's okay. I can get it. Why don't you go hide in the kitchen?",2
LIESLorelai,Really? Thank you.,2
RORY,What is going on?,2
LORELAI,I don't know. I think George and Martha are joining us for dinner.,2
RICHARD,I didn't know that my every conversation needed to be reported to you. I stand corrected.,2
Posted,11/18/01 05:31,2
EMILY,I have been the co-chair of the Starlight Foundation for the last eight years.,2
RICHARD,"I know this, Emily.",2
EMILY,And the Black and White Ball is the main fundraising event of the season.,2
RICHARD,It's one year.,2
EMILY,The co-chair cannot miss the main fundraising event.,2
RICHARD,Why? Won't the chair be there?,2
EMILY,Is this a joke to you?,2
RICHARD,"Emily, I have too many things to take care of at work. I don't have time for frivolous parties.",2
EMILY,Frivolous parties? Friv. . . .,2
RICHARD,"Well, where are you going? Oh, come back here.",2
RORY,"Wow, this is bad.",2
LORELAI,"I know, I wish we had popcorn.",2
RORY,Mom.,2
LORELAI,Shh. Incoming.,2
EMILY,"The Hartford Zoological Silent Auction, the Mark Twain House Restoration Fund luncheon, the Harriet Beecher Stowe Literacy Auction.",2
RICHARD,"I can read those myself, you know.",2
EMILY,This is the fourth event you've taken upon yourself to turn down on our behalf. And I am on the board of all of those foundations. Now how do you think that makes me look?,2
RICHARD,Like your husband is busy and has a great deal of responsibility.,2
EMILY,"Well, I have responsibilities too.",2
RICHARD,I understand that your social engagements are important.,2
EMILY,They're not just social engagements.,2
RICHARD,Anything at which you serve tea is a social engagement.,2
EMILY,That's it. I am gonna get a tape recorder so you can hear how pompous and condescending you sound.,2
RICHARD,Wha...uh...Emily.,2
EMILY,"No, I wouldn't want you to take my word for it. I might be delirious from all that tea I'vebeen drinking.",2
RICHARD,Oh stop this.,2
RORY,Maybe we should leave.,2
LORELAI,Are you kidding? We've got dinner theater here.,2
RORY,But Grandma and Grandpa are obviously in a fight.,2
LORELAI,Yeah?,2
RORY,One that they probably wouldn't want us to see.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, we stumbled in here completely innocently. We came for dinner as usual, per their request. We had no idea we were walking into The Lion King without the puppet heads.",2
RICHARD,Get that thing out of my face.,2
EMILY,Just say the tea thing again.,2
RICHARD,You are behaving like a child.,2
EMILY,"Turn around when you talk, would you? I'm not sure how good this microphone is.",2
RICHARD,Oh.,2
EMILY,What?,2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,"It sucks. I know it sucks, just tell me it sucks.",2
LORELAI,It's great.,2
RORY,No it's not.,2
LORELAI,It's an A.,2
RORY,Don't lie.,2
LORELAI,A-plus.,2
RORY,You're my mom.,2
LORELAI,Is anything higher than an A-plus?,2
RORY,You have to say that.,2
LORELAI,It's an A-plus with a crown and a wand.,2
RORY,"This is not how you raise a child. You don't send them out there with a false sense of pride because out there, in the real world, no one will coddle you. I'd rather know right now if I'm gonna be working at CNN or carrying a basket around it's offices with sandwiches in it.",2
LORELAI,Rory.,2
RORY,Yeah?,2
LORELAI,It's great.,2
RORY,Really?,2
LORELAI,Really really.,2
RORY,Thank you.,2
LUKE,"Coffee coffee. Okay, what do you want? Eggs, toast, combo?",2
LORELAI,"What's the rush there, Zippy?",2
LUKE,I'm just swamped this morning. I was supposed to have help but I don't. So order right now or I'm bringing the both of you an egg white omelet with a side of steamed spinach.,2
LORELAI,Pancakes.,2
RORY,French toast.,2
LUKE,"Thank you. Jess, you were supposed to be down here. . . .what the hell is that?",2
JESS,What?,2
LUKE,That.,2
JESS,That is a shirt.,2
LUKE,Change.,2
JESS,What?,2
LUKE,Go upstairs and change your shirt.,2
JESS,I like this shirt.,2
LUKE,How can you like that shirt?,2
JESS,It brings out my eyes.,2
LUKE,"Hey, part of the deal of you staying here is that you work here, and when you work here you will wear proper work attire, and that is not proper work attire. Now go upstairs and change intosomething that won't scare the hell out of my customers.",2
JESS,Whatever you say Uncle Luke.,2
LORELAI,Gross shirt.,2
RORY,Yeah.,2
LORELAI,Good band.,2
RORY,,2
EMILY,Thank you.,2
MAID,"Mm hmm. LADY 1: Another new one, Emily?",2
EMILY,"Yes. The last one only made it through one evening. Thoroughly nervous creature. LADY 2: What do you do to them, Em?",2
EMILY,"Oh, the usual. Clean this, cook that, sacrifice a virgin on your way out. LADY 1: The things you say. LADY 2: We could've done with some of that at the ball the other night.",2
EMILY,"Why, was it dull? LADY 2: I felt as if my shoes were going out of style as I sat there.",2
EMILY,"What a shame. LADY 3: Now, Nattie, it wasn't all dull. Are we forgetting Truly Bishop?",2
NATTIE,"Oh, that's right.",2
EMILY,"What, what about Truly Bishop? LADY 3: Well, you know she and Eugene split up last month.",2
EMILY,What?,2
NATTIE,"Oh Em! You knew about that. They had this huge fight at the. . oh that's right, you missed the Schafer's cocktail party.",2
EMILY,They broke up at the Schafer's cocktail party?,2
NATTIE,He has another family in Salisbury.,2
EMILY,"No!LADY 3: She's 26, with a 2 year old.",2
EMILY,How did Truly find out?,2
NATTIE,The little tart sent her a letter.,2
EMILY,"Oh my God. LADY 1: So Truly confronted Eugene after consuming a bottle and a half of Cristal, and he admitted it. He said he was going to leave her and marry the Salisbury concubine.",2
EMILY,What did she do? LADY 1: She threw an ice sculpture at his head.,2
EMILY,"I can't believe I missed that. LADY 1: You've missed everything lately. LADY 3: Yes, where have you been? Is everything all right?",2
EMILY,"Yes, it's just, uh, Richard.",2
NATTIE,"He hasn't been hanging out in Salisbury, has he?",2
EMILY,"No, he's been swamped at work. Night and day, weekends. You'd think he was the only person who worked at that company. Plus, he hasn't been feeling very well. His back and knees. Very bad knees. Oh Rory, what a nice surprise.",2
RORY,Hey Grandma. Sorry to butt in like this.,2
EMILY,"Nonsense, come an d meet my friends. Ladies, I'd like you to meet my granddaughter Rory. LADY 3: Well, hello Rory.",2
RORY,Nice to meet you.,2
NATTIE,"My goodness, what a pretty girl you are. LADY 1: She looks just like Lorelai, doesn't she?",2
NATTIE,The eyes. LADY 3: The nose. LADY 1: Walk around sweetie.,2
EMILY,"Sally, leave the girl alone. LADY 1: I just wanna see the walk. Lorelai had such a specific walk. LADY 3: Fast. LADY 1: That was it.",2
EMILY,"Come, sit, would you like some tea?",2
RORY,"Oh, no. I just came to pick up a book that Grandpa was supposed to leave for me.",2
EMILY,Go check his study. It might be on his desk.,2
RORY,"Okay, thanks. LADY 3: Emily, your granddaughter is just lovely. How old is she?",2
EMILY,"Sixteen. LADY 3: Sixteen, that's a nice age. LADY 1: So, have you thought about her debut?",2
EMILY,"Oh, uh, no, not yet. LADY 3: Well you know, the Daughters of the Daughters of the American Revolution Debutante Ball is next week.",2
EMILY,It is? I hadn't realized. LADY 3: Why don't you present Rory there?,2
EMILY,"Oh. . uh. . Well, I don't know. Isn't it a little late? LADY 1: Oh please. For Emily Gilmore, I'm sure they'll bend the rules. LADY 3: Oh you have to. With a girl like that Emily, you'll be the hit of the ball.",2
NATTIE,"She'd definitely be the prettiest one there. LADY 1: Except for Katie Heathington. LADY 3: No, didn't you hear? Katie fell off her horse, has a scab on her face.",2
NATTIE,"Oh, well then, if Katie Heathington has a scab on her face, Rory will definitely be the prettiest one there. LADY 3: It'll be your crowning moment.",2
RORY,,2
RORY,I'm coming out.,2
LORELAI,Out of what?,2
RORY,Out into society.,2
LORELAI,What are you talking about?,2
RORY,I went to Grandma's house after school.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, right away, bad.",2
RORY,"And, um, her DAR friends are all there and they're talking about this debutante ball that's being thrown.",2
LORELAI,Oh no.,2
RORY,"And when I got back from Grandpa's office, they all invited me out onto the patio.",2
LORELAI,"No no no, please tell me you did not go out onto the patio.",2
RORY,I went out onto the patio.,2
LORELAI,"Ugh, Rory, that's like accepting the position as the drummer in Spinal Tap.",2
RORY,"Before I knew it, Grandma was telling me how important it is for a person to be properly presented to society.",2
LORELAI,Ugh.,2
RORY,And how every young girl dreams of this day.,2
LORELAI,Agh.,2
RORY,And how there are flowers.,2
LORELAI,Oh Lord.,2
RORY,And music.,2
LORELAI,Please.,2
RORY,And cake.,2
LORELAI,"Oh yeah, the cake's actually good.",2
RORY,"And before I knew it, Grandma was bringing out your old dress and I was trying it on and. . . what are you doing?",2
LORELAI,I'm getting you out of this.,2
RORY,"Mom, wait.",2
LORELAI,"I swear, there is nothing in the world my mother is better at than getting someone to agree to something that in any other universe, they would never ever consider.",2
RORY,Mom.,2
LORELAI,I am still convinced she had something to do with Lily Tomlin doing that movie with John Travolta.,2
RORY,I'm doing this.,2
LORELAI,Why?,2
RORY,Because you should've seen the look on Grandma's face when she asked me. It's just really really important to her.,2
LORELAI,But. . .,2
RORY,"Now if it's that important to her, and it's not that important to me, then why shouldn't I do it?",2
LORELAI,"Rory, do you now what a coming out party says?",2
RORY,It says I'm a woman now.,2
LORELAI,"No. It says, 'Hi, I'm Rory. I'm of good breeding and marriageable age, and I will now parade around in front of young men of similarly good breeding and marriageable age so they can all take a good long look at me.'",2
RORY,You're exaggerating.,2
LORELAI,"No, it's like animals being up for bid at the county fair, except sheep don't wear hoop skirts.",2
RORY,"Look, I promised, but you don't have to be apart of it if you don't want to.",2
LORELAI,"No, no, if you wanna do it, I'll help. It's just weird. This is all the stuff I ran away from. I just assumed you'd be running with me.",2
RORY,"Well, I would, but I heard debutantes don't run. Something about the heels.",2
LORELAI,"All right then. If you're sure, where do we start? Uh, let's see. Well, you have a dress. You need a dowry, I guess. There you go. And uh, you'll need shoes, hose, gloves, some mice, a dog, a pumpkin. What's wrong?",2
RORY,"Oh, nothing.",2
LORELAI,Rory.,2
RORY,"Oh, no, it just says that your father is supposed to present you at the ceremony.",2
LORELAI,Oh.,2
RORY,"Whatever, it's no big deal. I can get someone else to do it. Grandpa probably.",2
LORELAI,Rory.,2
RORY,Or Taylor.,2
LORELAI,Okay.,2
RORY,Or the cable guy looked pretty friendly last week. Maybe he has a tux.,2
LORELAI,Hand me the phone.,2
RORY,I was kidding about the cable guy. What are you doing?,2
LORELAI,"Look missy, there are plenty of things that should weird you out about coming out, but inviting your father shouldn't be one of them.",2
OPERATORory,The number you have dialed. . .,2
LORELAI,"Umm, wra. . . gum wrapper.",2
RORY,He's not going to come.,2
LORELAI,You don't know until you ask.,2
RORY,Mom.,2
LORELAI,"Look, we call, we ask, there's no harm. Trust me. Cable guy's not going anywhere.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Hello?,2
LORELAI,"Ugh, hi. Where the hell are you?",2
CHRISTOPERory,Boston.,2
LORELAI,Boston?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Yeah, Boston. Baked Beans, cream pie, tea party, strangler.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, that Boston.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,And you?,2
LORELAI,Me.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Where are you?,2
LORELAI,Helsinki.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Really.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, I finally got the girl band together and after a week opening stateside, we headed across the Atlantic and now we're huge with the Nordic set.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,It's good to hear from you. We haven't talked in awhile.,2
LORELAI,"You could've called too, you know. Or do you have one of those special phones that only receives calls?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, I figured you had a lot going on what with the engagement and the canceling of the engagement. How's that going, by the way?",2
LORELAI,"No, still canceled.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,You okay?,2
LORELAI,Good. And I'm even better when I'm not talking about it.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Moving on then.,2
LORELAI,So I have some shocking news. Rory's coming out.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Out of what?,2
LORELAI,"Coming out. White dresses, gloves, curtsies.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Stop it.,2
LORELAI,I swear to God.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,I can't believe you're letting her do it.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, well, I wasn't about to let her use my method of getting out of it.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,This is crazy.,2
LORELAI,"She's doing it as a favor to my mom, there's no talking her out of it.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, did you tell her about Barbara Hutton, Doris Duke, Gloria Vanderbilt?",2
LORELAI,"Yes, and she's perfectly willing to marry Cary Grant, get offed by her crazy butler and start designing blue jeans as soon as the ball ends.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, okay, if that's what she wants.",2
LORELAI,Now comes the reason for my phone call.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,All your regular 976 numbers are busy.,2
LORELAI,"Now I know this is totally not your thing, but as you will remember, part of the whole coming out process involves the girls being escorted around the dance floor by their Dads.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Ah.,2
LORELAI,"Now, I know you would rather sit through ""Endless Love"" than ever be apart of this scene again. But this is very important to your daughter and she has never asked you for anything, and although no one's keeping track, it would seem that your constant non-presence in her life and your lack of ever showing up when you say you're going to or calling when you say you're going to or basically doing anything when you say you're going to would tend to indicate that you owe her, big time. Now before you say no, I want you to take a minute and remember you have a great daughter who needs you and she has a mother who will hunt you down like a half-priced Kate Spade purse if you disappoint her.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Okay, I'm there.",2
LORELAI,"By there, do you mean the Daughters of the American Revolution Annual Debutante Ball?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Yes.,2
LORELAI,"Oh Chris, please don't make this promise if you can't.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,I wouldn't miss it.,2
LORELAI,It's next weekend.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,I'll clear my schedule.,2
LORELAI,You swear?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Oh wait, next weekend?",2
LORELAI,Christopher!,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"I'm kidding, I will definitely be there.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, and in exchange for that I will refrain from saying the ten things that came to mind for making fun of your schedule.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Thanks.,2
LORELAI,Bye.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Bye.,2
LORELAI,"Hey Little Debbie, your dad is definitely gonna be there.",2
RORY,You're kidding!,2
LORELAI,"No, he's gonna walk you down the stairs, and turn you in a circle, watch you curtsy, and announce that Rory Gilmore is officially open for business.",2
RORY,I can't believe it. And he definitely said definitely?,2
LORELAI,Definitely.,2
RORY,So there's a fifty/fifty chance.,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,"No Mom, I'm sure one crinolin will be plenty. No, she doesn't. I'm sure she doesn't. Yeah, in what scenario would I have bought Rory elbow length kidskin gloves, Mom? Oh, I'm sorry, I meant what scenario on my planet would I have bought Rory elbow length kidskin gloves?",2
RORY,So?,2
DEAN,So what?,2
RORY,It's good huh?,2
DEAN,It's the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction.,2
RORY,And doesn't Neil Young look cool?,2
DEAN,I guess.,2
RORY,"If you'll notice, he's wearing a tux.",2
DEAN,"Neil Young looks cool because he's Neil Young, not because he's wearing a tux.",2
LORELAI,"No, I don't have to ask her mom 'cause I know the answer. I know the answer Mom, I know the answer. Yeah, no, okay, well I don't have to ask her Mom Hold on. Rory, would you like Grandma's hairstylist to come an d set your hair before the ball? . . Oh, I did not coach her Mom, go back to talking about gloves.",2
RORY,I think you're gonna look great in a tux.,2
LANE,Tails.,2
DEAN,What?,2
LANE,"Yeah, according to this it says that all escorts must be properly attired in black tails, white cumberbuns, and white gloves.",2
DEAN,What?,2
RORY,I'm sure the gloves are optional.,2
LANE,Not according to this.,2
DEAN,Tails? Gloves?,2
RORY,Rememb er Neil Young. Rememb er that you love me. Remember that I'll be watching BattleBots with you for a month.,2
DEAN,Show me N eil Young again.,2
RORY,,2
RORY,Dad!,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Whoa! Hold it right there. A lady never runs out to meet a gentleman caller who hasn't been announced.,2
RORY,"Sorry, we haven't tamed my wild ways yet.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Thank God I'm here now.,2
RORY,I missed you!,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Me too.,2
LORELAI,Hey.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Hey.,2
LORELAI,What is this?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"What? Oh my God, where did this come from?",2
LORELAI,What happened to your bike?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,A crazy game of key exchange at the car wash.,2
LORELAI,This is a car.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Yes it is.,2
LORELAI,"It has four wheels and a roof and airbags and seat belts and my God, it smells like a forest.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, I needed a little more space. Had something big to haul. I believe this belongs to you.",2
RORY,The Compact Oxford English Dictionary!,2
CHRISTOPHERory,I promised you I'd get it. I'm just sorry it took so long.,2
RORY,That's okay.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"On the bright side, this is the new edition. If I'd gotten you the old one, you wouldn't have the word 'jiggy' in it.",2
RORY,"Thank you. I love it, I'm gonna go look things up right now.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Wait wait.,2
RORY,Thanks.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Go.,2
LORELAI,That was really great of you.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Thank you. So back to mocking my car?,2
LORELAI,"Oh yeah. A Volvo sedan, are you kidding?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,This is a great car.,2
LORELAI,For driving to bingo.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, it just seemed like time. I couldn't keep showing up for work on my bike.",2
LORELAI,Work?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,You've heard of it.,2
LORELAI,"Yes, but I didn't think you had.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, it took awhile. I kept getting it mixed up with nap, but I finally figured it out.",2
LORELAI,"So, you bought a car and got a job?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Actually, job then car.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, 'cause it's more responsible that way.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Exactly.,2
LORELAI,"Wow, so tell me ab out the job.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, I show up everyday, drink bad coffee, exchange lame pleasantries in the break room with Linda from mar keting, and then at the end of two weeks they give me a paycheck. It's a pretty cool system.",2
LORELAI,You're serious?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, you know how us working types are. Get in.",2
LORELAI,Well uh. . .I'm not supposed to take rides with strangers.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Trust me.,2
LORELAI,"Yes, but only if you promise we won't go over 25 miles an hour on the motorway. Oh my God, George Lucas wishes he had this sound system.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"I've got Alpine head units, two subs, and two twelves. In exchange, no passenger- side airbag.",2
LORELAI,"Ah, so the old Christopher still lives.",2
RORY,Could you please attenuate the cacophony out here?,2
LORELAI,Huh?,2
RORY,Turn down the music.,2
LORELAI,"Next time in stead of a dictionary, just slip her a crisp twenty.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,,2
LORELAI,Twelve pairs of pantyhose.,2
EMILY,It's going to be a long night. She's bound to have a run.,2
LORELAI,Twelve pairs.,2
EMILY,"There's the presentation, the circle, the curtsy, the fan dance.",2
LORELAI,"Mom, there'd have to be a 12k run and a jujitsu demonstration for her to go through twelve pairs of pantyhose.",2
EMILY,"Does it really hurt to be prepared, Lorelai?",2
LORELAI,"No, Mom, it doesn't hurt to be prepared.",2
EMILY,Thank you.,2
LORELAI,"And the good news is, now she is prepared for her high school graduation, her college graduation, her marriage, three to five anniversaries, a hostess gig, and jury duty, especially if she's sequestered.",2
EMILY,You make me tired.,2
EMILY,"Oh Richard, I didn't know you were home.",2
RICHARD,"Yes, well, we learn something everyday.",2
EMILY,You didn't have to work?,2
RICHARD,I am working.,2
LORELAI,"Hey Dad, guess how many pairs of pantyhose we bought today?",2
RICHARD,"I'd rather not, if you don't mind.",2
EMILY,"Oh Richard, I got you some beautiful new cufflinks for this weekend.",2
RICHARD,I already have cufflinks.,2
EMILY,"I know, but these have bulldogs on them. Come look.",2
RICHARD,I'll look at them later.,2
EMILY,"All right, fine. Just rememb er to pick up your tux from the cleaners tomorrow.",2
RICHARD,I won't have time.,2
EMILY,It's right around the corner from your office.,2
RICHARD,I have to go in early tomorrow.,2
EMILY,"Well, go now.",2
RICHARD,I am busy now.,2
EMILY,Doing what?,2
RICHARD,"Emily, I am not going to qualify my time with you. I am not going to pick up my tuxedo. You planned this ridiculous affair, you pick up my tuxedo. Or I simply don't have to go. Either one of these options is fine with me.",2
LORELAI,"Hey Mom, I might be reading too much into this, but um, is something going on between you and Dad?",2
EMILY,What are you talking about?,2
LORELAI,"I don't know, he just seems a little less jolly than usual.",2
EMILY,He's just busy.,2
LORELAI,He seems upset.,2
EMILY,"Well, he's not.",2
LORELAI,You seem upset.,2
EMILY,Well I'm not. We're both fine.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, my mistake.",2
EMILY,,2
PATTY,"Now, keep counting in your heads. Look each other in the eye. Dean, are you leading?",2
DEAN,,2
PATTY,"Okay okay, stop stop stop. Now remember, one of the most important things in ballroom dancing is to rememb er to spot, otherwise you're gonna get dizzy. So, what you wanna do is you wanna pick out something to focus on. I usually like to find a lonely seaman. Then when turning, whip your head around and find your spot again. Hello sailor, hello sailor, hello sailor. Now you try it.",2
DEAN,You've gotta be kidding me.,2
RORY,I think you can do it without the 'hello sailor' part.,2
DEAN,Rory.,2
RORY,BattleBots.,2
DEAN,,2
PATTY,Now take it from the top.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, you guys are really improving. Now you're actually facing each other.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,,2
PATTY,"Okay, take five, but don't sit down because your muscles will get cold.",2
LORELAI,So how's it going?,2
RORY,"Actually, I'm not very good.",2
DEAN,"Yeah, which is really holding me back because I'm a natural.",2
LORELAI,"Well, maybe you just need a glittery glove and a really freaky face.",2
RORY,"At one point Miss Patty thought Dean was gonna get hurt, she made me sit in the corner and watch.",2
LORELAI,Hey! Nobody puts Baby in the corner.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"It's not your fault. Ballroom dancing is a wonderfully sexist thing. Any woman can do it, all she needs is a strong male lead. No offense Dean.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, agh!",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Oh, well, most any woman can do it.",2
LORELAI,"I wasn't ready, I wasn't ready. I want a do over.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Fine. May I have this dance?,2
LORELAI,I don't know. Do you have a trust fund? Always make sure.,2
RORY,"Okay, I'm adopted.",2
DEAN,"Yeah, I'm never gonna be able to do that.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,,2
PATTY,"Listen to your father, Rory. Your adorable, adorable father.",2
LORELAI,"Come on, let's get you out of here before you become Patty's next husband.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,,2
PATTY,,2
LORELAI,Did you know you still knew how to do that?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,I wish I didn't. Imagine what we could do if we freed up the brain space that holds onto the Vianese Waltz.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, it's right up there in between old Brady Bunch reruns and the lyrics to Rapture.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Ooh, I gotta say, this isn't like the chai lattes in Boston.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, well, expecting Luke to make a chai anything was completely insane.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure he just threw a cinnamon stick in some tea.",2
LORELAI,I'm pretty sure it's not a cinnamon stick.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Okay, throwing this out now.",2
LORELAI,"So chai latte, when did that happen?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,I don't know. Everyone at work drinks them.,2
LORELAI,"Huh. Well, since you still haven't told me what exactly it is that you do, I'm gonna go with yoga instructor or chiropractor.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"No, it's actually pretty interesting. I'm working for this firm that helps those overblown tech companies scale back and stay afloat now that they're facing leaner times.",2
LORELAI,"I'm sorry, uh, what's the interesting part?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,We dress like superheroes when we do it.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, nice. So how long do you think you'll be able to keep this going?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, I'm pretty happy there. I'd say at least 'til Tuesday.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, so long term.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"You know, it's weird. I always hated the idea of having to be somewhere at a specific time day after day, but as it turns out, I like the stability.",2
LORELAI,Really?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Yeah. I like that at the end of the day, I feel like I've done something. I've earned something.",2
LORELAI,"Well, I think that's really great.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Only took me ten years and several failed business ventures to figure out what I wanted.,2
LORELAI,Which is?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Not my parents' life.,2
LORELAI,Ah.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Something you figured out at sixteen.,2
LORELAI,"Actually, six months, but I just couldn't vocalize it yet.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Yeah, you knew what you wanted, you went out and got it. I was always a little jealous of you.",2
LORELAI,"Well, you seem to be catching up. We did good.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,,2
LORELAI,"See now, only a lady can gracefully walk around a room with a book on her head while eating Kung Pao chicken. And a great lady can even spit the peanuts back into the container without anyone noticing.",2
RORY,Wow.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, well, don't be intimidated. You have to practice and practice to get to my level.",2
RORY,Anyone want the last eggroll?,2
DEAN,"Uh, no.",2
LORELAI,Heh. Where are you going?,2
RORY,To get the eggroll.,2
LORELAI,You're getting the eggroll yourself?,2
RORY,Yes.,2
LORELAI,No! Ladies never get their own eggrolls. Ladies never get their own anything. They don't even get their own ideas.,2
RORY,Oh boy.,2
LORELAI,"They just sit helplessly and wait for some young strong man to come by and assist them. They don't step in puddles, they don't step over puddles. They can't even look at puddles. They actually need to be blindfolded and thrown in a sack and carried over puddles.",2
RORY,Isn't there a moratorium on how long ladies are supposed to talk?,2
LORELAI,"Uhh, no. Now repeat after me, I am completely helpless.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Okay, so you pull the left side through the back loop and tug a little bit on both sides, and you my friend, might just be mistaken for a gentleman. Or a waiter.",2
DEAN,"So, how do you know how to do this?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Seventeen cotillions, a dozen debutante balls, and a brief but scarring experiment with the Children of the American Revolution.",2
LORELAI,Where you wore nothing but the bowtie.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"A good idea on conception, but the sudden snowstorm instantly dampened the effect.",2
DEAN,"Hey, uh, do you think it's cool when Neil Young wears a tux?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Yeah, of course, but it's Neil Young.",2
DEAN,All right. I should get going. I'll see you at three.,2
RORY,Okay. Oh wait.,2
DEAN,What's this?,2
RORY,Your gloves.,2
DEAN,I thought you were kidding.,2
LORELAI,No no. Ladies never kid.,2
DEAN,Bye.,2
LORELAI,Bye.,2
RORY,I think I'm going to bed too.,2
LORELAI,Do you need help?,2
RORY,No.,2
LORELAI,Wrong! The correct answer is yes. Ladies need help with everything.,2
RORY,Goodnight.,2
LORELAI,,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Night.,2
RORY,Night.,2
LORELAI,"I don't know about that girl. I don't know how she's ever gonna make it in society. At this rate, she's gonna actually get a job and only marry once.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,You calling your mom again?,2
LORELAI,"I don't get it. For the last week, every five minutes she's calling me checking on shoe fittings and curtsy progress, and have I talked Rory into putting her hair up yet, and then tonight, nothing.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, I'm sure they had a lot of getting ready to do for themselves tonight.",2
LORELAI,She's been acting so weird lately. They're fighting. Openly fighting. I don't think they've ever done that before. I'm not sure what to do about it.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Move to California. That's what I do when my parents fight.,2
LORELAI,"You know, my father doesn't even want to go tomorrow. His perfect angle granddaughter is being presented to society in front of all his friends and colleagues, something he never got to do with his bad, loser, evil daughter.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Maybe you should talk to them. I'm sorry, was that me that said that? I must've had an aneurysm.",2
LORELAI,"Well, nothing more I can do tonight. I'm gonna head up to bed. Do you want me to turn off the lights?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Actually, I have to stay up and do a little work tonight.",2
LORELAI,I'm sorry. I keep forgetting that's not a joke anymore.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,,2
RORY,"Wow, this place is huge. Do I have to walk down those stairs?",2
LORELAI,"Oh, I'm afraid so. Unless you wanna make a really memorable entrance and just sliiide down the banister. Which I totally encourage, by the way.",2
LADY,You are ,2
RORY,Lorelai Gilmore.,2
LADY,Late.,2
LORELAI,"Sorry, my fault. Took me aw hile to get pretty. Not all of us are sixteen anymore, you know what I mean? No.",2
LADY,You are to head up the stairs. The preparation room is on the right.,2
LORELAI,Look for the toxic cloud of Chanel and Final Net.,2
LORELAI,,2
LADY,"Hang your dress there, put your makeup on over there. You'll have to make do with a non- lighted mirror. The lighted ones went to the girls that were here before dawn. Listen up ladies, everyone must be beautiful and ready to go by 7:30.",2
RORY,I can't believe we have an hour and a half.,2
LIBBY,"I know, I am never gonna be ready in time. God only knows if the swelling on my nose is gonna go down. I had to go and inherit my father's nose. I'm Libby.",2
RORY,Rory.,2
LIBBY,"Uh, which one should I wear? I've thought about this all month, and I cannot decide.",2
RORY,"Oh, well, that's a tough one.",2
LIBBY,"I know. This is red red, and this is orange red. The wrong one and I will end up looking like a hooker. Or a teacher.",2
RORY,That's a lot of pressure.,2
LIBBY,The two minutes you are standing on those stairs tonight will determine the social status for the rest of your life.,2
RORY,"Wow, what if you trip? I mean, not that you would. You wouldn't. I might. Probably will actually. Could be a real Cirque du Soleil kind of night.",2
LIBBY,,2
LORELAI,"You are a wonderful, wonderful man. I have a feeling we're going to be very close tonight. Hmm. Mom, you're here.",2
EMILY,"Where should I be, Spain?",2
LORELAI,Oh. I tried calling you all night last night.,2
EMILY,I was very busy.,2
LORELAI,And then we got here before you.,2
EMILY,"What is your point, Lorelai?",2
LORELAI,Nothing. It's just weird.,2
EMILY,"Well, I'm here now, so it's not weird anymore. Look at these flowers. Baby's breath. What is this, County General?",2
LORELAI,You look very nice Mom. I like your dress.,2
EMILY,"Cotton tablecloths, folding chairs. It's not supposed to be like this. In my day, people sat in real chairs.",2
LORELAI,"Mom, what's the matter?",2
EMILY,"I wanted my granddaughter to be presented to society in a beautiful elegant ballroom, not a Shakey's.",2
LORELAI,The room is beautiful Mom. You're being too critical.,2
EMILY,There's Nan. I'm going to have a little talk with her about the proper height for a taper.,2
LORELAI,,2
LIBBY,Midori sour?,2
RORY,"Oh, no thanks.",2
LIBBY,"More for me. At my last coming out, I shared with this girl who couldn't handle her booze. Neon green puke all over her white dress.",2
RORY,Your last coming out?,2
LIBBY,"Oh, this is my fifth one this year.",2
RORY,Wow.,2
LIBBY,"You know, they say four out of five debs marry their escorts.",2
RORY,Kind of like the dentists with Trident.,2
LIBBY,"Well I figure, five coming out balls, five escorts, one of them has to stick, right?",2
RORY,Good logic.,2
LIBBY,"So, is your escort the one?",2
RORY,The one what?,2
LIBBY,The one you're gonna marry.,2
RORY,"Oh, well ",2
LIBBY,Is he cute?,2
RORY,"Yes, he is very cute but ",2
LIBBY,Where are you guys planning to live when you get married?,2
RORY,"Okay, hold on a second.",2
LIBBY,"Katie, hi. Too bad about your face.",2
KATIE,Is it horrible?,2
LIBBY,,2
LORELAI,Rehab?LADY 1: Fat farm.,2
LORELAI,Ah.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Hi, sorry to interrupt. Could you come with me? My cumberbun and I aren't seeing eye to eye.",2
LORELAI,"Men, totally helpless. Excuse me.",2
LORELAI,"You saved me. I love you. I wanna have your baby. Oops, too late.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,I saw the look. Same one you had that time you ended up on homecoming court.,2
LORELAI,"Ugh, someone's idea of a sick, sick joke. Hey, by the way, Neil Young's got nothing on you.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Yeah?,2
LORELAI,Yeah.,2
EMILY,"Lorelai, have you seen your father?",2
LORELAI,"Uh, no.",2
EMILY,He promised me he'd be here by now.,2
LORELAI,"Wait, you didn't come together?",2
EMILY,"I swear, if he misses this ",2
LORELAI,"Well, Mom, did you call him?",2
EMILY,Yes I called him. Of course I called him. I wouldn't go this long without calling him.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Emily, he's here.",2
EMILY,"Where? Oh. Richard, where have you been?",2
RICHARD,Where have I been?,2
EMILY,"Yes, where have you been?",2
RICHARD,"I'm here, aren't I?",2
LORELAI,I can't look. Did she beat him with the baby's breath?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"No, they're just energetically practicing their sign language.",2
LORELAI,Oh God.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Okay, I think this is a really good time for a martini. Hello. Thirsty people here. Ah, what are you doing?",2
LORELAI,Steve won't mind.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Little tip. Never a good idea to let people know you're on a first name basis with the bartender. Wow, this is really something.",2
LORELAI,What?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,You and I together at a debutante ball.,2
LORELAI,"Huh, yeah.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Just like it would've been sixteen years ago.,2
LORELAI,Fancy dress.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Sneaking booze.,2
LORELAI,Parents acting crazy.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,You look great.,2
LORELAI,I'm so glad you're here.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,So am I.,2
ANNOUNCERory,All fathers please report to the debutante staging area upstairs. Fathers to the staging area.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Showtime. You gonna be all right?,2
LORELAI,Absolutely.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,I'll see you later.,2
LORELAI,,2
DEAN,Hey. I just wanted to see you before you became a proper lady of society.,2
RORY,So what do you think?,2
DEAN,I think you look like a cotton ball.,2
RORY,"Why, thank you Jeeves.",2
DEAN,But a really cute cotton ball.,2
LIBBY,"Oh my God, is this your escort?",2
RORY,"Yeah, it is.",2
LIBBY,You are totally getting married.,2
DEAN,What did she say?,2
RORY,"Oh, well... Dad, great, let's go.",2
DEAN,"I'll, uh, I'll meet you downstairs. Good luck.",2
RORY,Okay.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Last chance to shimmy down the drainpipe.,2
RORY,Do me a f avor?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Anything.,2
RORY,Just don't let me fall.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,,2
PODIUM,"Good evening. On behalf of the Daughters of the American Revolution, I would like to welcome you to our annual debutante ball. Oh this brings back so many memories. I myself came out in this very hall in nineteen well, let's just say, a number of years ago. Now the word debutante comes from the French word debuter, which means to lead off. . .",2
EMILY,Just come sit down.,2
RICHARD,I am going to finish my drink.,2
EMILY,"You won't be happy until you've spoiled this entire evening, will you?",2
LORELAI,"Um, guys, hi, there's a lady up there with a rock the size of Neptune around her neck talking about the debutantes of ancient Greece. It's a lot easier to fall asleep if you're sitting down, trust me.",2
RICHARD,I will sit down when I'm ready to sit down.,2
EMILY,"Richard, lower your voice.",2
RICHARD,"No, I will not lower my voice. I paid a fortune to be here, and I will speak just as loudly as I like.",2
EMILY,You're embarrassing us. You're embarrassing Rory.,2
RICHARD,"Embarrassing Rory? This wasn't Rory's idea. This was your idea. This whole ridiculous evening was your idea, Emily.",2
EMILY,You don't want your granddaughter presented to society?,2
RICHARD,"To hell with society. Yes, I'm talking about you!",2
LORELAI,"Come on, that's it.",2
LORELAI,"Are you two completely out of your mind? There is a ceremony going on in there. Young girls in ugly dresses and stupid fans are parading around in circles for God knows what reason, and you two are ruining it.",2
RICHARD,I didn't want to come here. You knew I didn't want to come here.,2
EMILY,"Well, that's too bad. We have a social responsibility Richard.",2
RICHARD,I am so tired of hearing you say that.,2
EMILY,People expect us to be certain places and do certain things and we can't just withdraw from all of that.,2
RICHARD,Do you know what I'm going through at work?,2
EMILY,"Your whole life isn't that damn company, Richard.",2
RICHARD,"I have told you what I'm going through, but somehow, you just don't seem to hear it. You don't listen to me. You don't listen to anybody.",2
EMILY,That is not true.,2
RICHARD,It is true. Isn't it true? Has she ever listened to a word you've said?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, well, hey, people listen in different ways, right? I mean, some people listen with their ears, and some people listen with not their ears, but that doesn't mean some actual listening hasn't happened in some form.",2
EMILY,I have listened to you Richard. I know exactly what is going on with you.,2
RICHARD,"Really, what?",2
EMILY,You lost an account.,2
LORELAI,What?,2
RICHARD,"No, I didn't lose an account. I was taken off an account. I was taken off an account that I personally brought into this company ten years ago.",2
EMILY,"There are other accounts, Richard.",2
RICHARD,I have been in charge of that account for ten years!,2
EMILY,"How can you be so angry? Yes, they took you off that account, but they also gave you a promotion.",2
RICHARD,"Oh, Emily.",2
EMILY,You said they moved you upstairs to a larger office and gave you a new title and a better parking space.,2
RICHARD,"Emily, dammit , I am being phased out.",2
EMILY,You are not.,2
RICHARD,What do you mean I'm not? I know whether I'm being phased out. I invented phased out for this company. Don't you think I did the exact same thing to Alan Parker?,2
EMILY,Alan Parker retired.,2
RICHARD,"Alan Parker was phased out. I now have his office, I now have his parking space. Do you know what happens from here? I lose more accounts, slowly but surely. They will put a younger man on them with me to be trained by the best. And then, one day they'll call and ask me to let that young man take a meet ing without me, just to see how fast he's learning, and then suddenly that young man is given that account. And this happens again and again and again until I'm nothing, but a symbolic figurehead that they roll out for banquets and group pictures. And then one day, Emily, I will be asked to leave.",2
EMILY,"Well, so what?",2
RICHARD,Excuse me.,2
LORELAI,"Dad, I don't think Mom mean t exactly ",2
EMILY,So what if that's true?,2
LORELAI,Or maybe she did.,2
EMILY,There are other options.,2
RICHARD,"I don't want other options. I want to get up every morning and put on my suit, and go to my office, and do my work, like I've done everyday for the past thirty years. That's what I want to do. That's the only thing I want to do.",2
RORY,"Um, excuse me, hi, sorry to interrupt, but I'm next. LADY AT",2
PODIUM,"Elizabeth Dotie, daughter of George Edward Dotie the fourth, and Elenor Dotie. Lorelai Gilmore, daughter of Christopher Hayden and Lorelai Gilmore.",2
EMILY,,2
RORY,So did you know that you're considered a hot Dad?,2
LORELAI,Hah!,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Really?,2
RORY,"Libby said that it's too bad you're my real Dad because if you were my stepdad, I could steal you away from mo m.",2
LORELAI,Ugh.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,That Libby's got a good life ahead of her.,2
LORELAI,"Well, I was very proud of all of you. You made it through the entire ceremony with a completely straight face. Almost all of you.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"I'm sorry, but that fan dance was more than I could take.",2
LORELAI,"Hey, I need a burger.",2
RORY,Me too. Dean?,2
DEAN,"Honestly, the only thing I can think of is taking off this tux.",2
LORELAI,"Hey, watch it, you're talking to a lady now.",2
DEAN,"Well, how about if I do it at home?",2
LORELAI,Better.,2
RORY,Thanks again for going with me.,2
DEAN,Tomorrow you start paying. Bye.,2
LORELAI,Bye. And then there were three.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Actually, I have to get back to Boston first thing in the morning so I'm gonna call it a night too.",2
RORY,What? Not even time for fries?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,I'll tell you what. I'll get up a little early and have coffee with you before I go. Deal?,2
RORY,Deal.,2
LORELAI,"Honey, go ahead and order for us. I'll be there in a sec.",2
RORY,Okay.,2
LORELAI,"I just wanted to tell you how amazing you were tonight. Really, you completely came through for her.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,She deserves it.,2
LORELAI,"I haven't always given you a lot of credit in the past, but I'm giving you credit now. Big credit. Major credit. Buy yourself a sofa.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Thanks. I will.,2
LORELAI,"You know, um, I happened to be looking through some old maps this afternoon and Icouldn't help but notice that Boston is not that far away.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Aw, you needed a map to tell you that?",2
LORELAI,"I also noticed that that, um, I-84 is a very good road. Solid, paved.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Uh huh.,2
LORELAI,"And I put this information in my pretty little head, I was thinking, if you wanted to maybe drop by occasionally, it wouldn't be too difficult.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,You realize I'll be driving the Volvo?,2
LORELAI,"Actually, I'm coming around to the Vovlo.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Really?,2
LORELAI,"Yes. I think it's sort of a Catholic schoolgirl thing, you know? It's conservative on the outside, bad on the inside.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,I like that image.,2
LORELAI,I've also heard the I-84 can get jammed on the weekends.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,It can.,2
LORELAI,"So if you wanted to stay a little longer, just to avoid the traffic, it might be a good idea. I mean, Rory would definitely love it, and I wouldn't mind either.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"That is a tempting offer, but I really have to get back.",2
LORELAI,To work?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,To work and to someone.,2
LORELAI,Oh.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,I know I should've told you.,2
LORELAI,"Oh no, that's fine. That's totally your business.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"No, I meant to, but Lor, it's just that you and I are so connected and...",2
LORELAI,"Chris, please, I get it. I think it's really great, I really do.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Thank you.,2
LORELAI,"So who is it? Ooh, let me guess. Linda from marketing got to you, didn't she?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Her name is Sherri.,2
LORELAI,Sherri from mar keting?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Sherri from Boston.,2
LORELAI,"Ah, hence the move.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Yes.,2
LORELAI,Is it serious?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,It's getting there.,2
LORELAI,Seeing you in just a bowtie serious?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,We're living together.,2
LORELAI,"Wow, you really have changed.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Yeah, well, Sherri made it pretty clear that I was gonna lose her if I didn't start getting it together, so...",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, well if you find a girl who's good with dating a square in a Volvo, you do what it takes to keep her.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Okay, uh, so I'll. . .I'll see you back home.",2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,Hey!,2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,After all you've been through tonight and I come in here and find you eating like that.,2
LORELAI,There you go.,2
RORY,Being a lady is hard.,2
LORELAI,"So tonight, what's the consensus?",2
RORY,"The fan dance was humiliating, I'm never doing a curtsy again, but having Dad around was great.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, it was.",2
RORY,"He's got a new girlfriend, you know.",2
LORELAI,Sherri.,2
RORY,Yeah.,2
LORELAI,"Poor girl's named after a Journey song, that's gotta be rough.",2
RORY,He seems happy.,2
LORELAI,He does. He really does.,2
RORY,I'm glad.,2
LORELAI,Me too.,2
RORY,I feel kind of bad for Grandma though. She was so into this night and then she ended up being so miserable.,2
LORELAI,Don't worry. She'll have more fun at the next one.,2
RORY,Excuse me?,2
LORELAI,"Yes, we have you signed up for the next six balls.",2
RORY,Not funny.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, you're doing this until you bring home a prize.",2
RORY,Ignoring you now.,2
LUKE,"So, back from the ball huh?",2
LORELAI,"Yes, I left behind a glass slipper and a business card in case the prince is really dumb.",2
LUKE,Good and desperate thinking.,2
LORELAI,"Thank you. Hmm, Luke.",2
LUKE,What?,2
LUKE,What do you think you're doing?,2
JESS,Working.,2
LUKE,"So you think this is funny, huh?",2
JESS,I'm sorry. I thought this was the uniform.,2
LUKE,"Okay, you know what, that's fine. Have your little joke, you know. It doesn't bother me at all. You just go over there and clean off that table, okay? I'm ignoring you. You do not exist.",2
JESS,Okay.,2
LUKE,"That's it, get upstairs and change.",2
JESS,Whatever you say Uncle Luke.,2
LUKE,"It's Luke, just Luke. Mister Luke. In fact, don't address me at all.",2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,"Yeah, why?",2
LORELAI,I have someone to complain to when life sucks or work sucks or just everything sucks. I have someone I can talk to.,2
RORY,"Yeah, who?",2
LORELAI,"Oh Shecky, you k*ll me. It just must be really lonely not to have that.",2
RORY,Are you thinking about Grandma?,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,Hey Mom.,2
EMILY,What are you doing here?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, nothing much. I had a little time before my business class and I thought, 'Hey, why don't I just go over to Mom's house and just hang.'",2
EMILY,Just what?,2
LORELAI,"Just hang, you know. Hang out. Talk, don't talk, whatever. Just hang.",2
EMILY,Oh.,2
LORELAI,"So you're gardening, huh?",2
EMILY,Yes.,2
LORELAI,"Okay. Well, don't let me stop you. I'll just sit here and just hang.",2
EMILY,Are you sure you don't need something?,2
LORELAI,Nope. I'm just here to hang.,2
EMILY,Hang. Well.,2
LORELAI,"You know Mom, if there's ever anything you want to talk about with me, you can.",2
EMILY,All right.,2

LORELAI,"Wow, busy today. Has Luke been advertising or something?",2
RORY,He gets good word-of-mouth.,2
LORELAI,"Well, we have to start spreading bad word-of-mouth so we can always have a table.",2
RORY,"Well, that would be wrong, but sure. Vermin?",2
LORELAI,Or no potable water.,2
RORY,Or no potable vermin.,2
LORELAI,That would scare them away.,2
RORY,Or confuse them away.,2
LORELAI,It's so weird to see him talking like that.,2
RORY,Like what?,2
LORELAI,"Just all friendly. He's usually only good for a quick couple of gruff monosyllables, and then he's off.",2
RORY,He is the master of the monosyllable.,2
LORELAI,"He never flirts with any of the women, do you notice that?",2
RORY,He's flirted with you numerous times.,2
LORELAI,Don't start.,2
RORY,"Hey, flirt with him now, we need coffee.",2
Posted,11/25/01 17:02,2
LORELAI,"Oh Luke, we're just dying for some refreshments.",2
LUKE,Keep your pants on.,2
LORELAI,Hmm. He can turn it off and turn it on so fast.,2
RORY,"Hey, I found a CD under the front seat of our car. Did you lose one?",2
LORELAI,"Not that I know of, but I'm kind of sloppy with them.",2
RORY,"So, you didn't hide it?",2
LORELAI,Why would I hide a CD?,2
RORY,I don't know. Bay City Rollers?,2
LORELAI,It's not a Bay City Rollers CD.,2
RORY,How do you know?,2
LORELAI,Because I know what's not hidden under that seat.,2
RORY,Ha! Because you know that Barry Manilow is under that seat.,2
LORELAI,Ugh.,2
LUKE,Where's Barry Manilow?,2
RORY,Under Mom's seat.,2
LORELAI,"All right, I confess, I was hiding Barry Manilow.",2
RORY,You confess!,2
LORELAI,But he was very big when I was very small and it's the live version where he does a medley of all the commer cial jingles he's written.,2
RORY,Don't worry. Everyone's allowed a guilty pleasure now and again.,2
LORELAI,"Hm, very diplomatic from the girl who had the Bryan Adams poster above her bed for two years.",2
RORY,Fink.,2
LORELAI,Do you have a guilty pleasure Luke?,2
LUKE,Nah.,2
LORELAI,Are you into music?,2
LUKE,Sure.,2
LORELAI,Monosyllabic man strikes again.,2
RORY,We'll have two muffins please.,2
LUKE,You got it.,2
LORELAI,Do you think he's dated anyone since Rachel?,2
RORY,I don't know. Where would he meet anyone? He's either here or in his apartment.,2
LORELAI,Maybe he has a secret life. Maybe he's got a little chippy stowed away in Mount Pilot.,2
RORY,"Well, we'll know eventually.",2
LORELAI,I say he's a bachelor for life.,2
RORY,I say there's someone for everyone.,2
LORELAI,What?,2
RORY,"Uhh, Barry Manilow.",2
LORELAI,"Ugh, stop.",2
RORY,Looks like we made it ,2
LORELAI,Oh yeah? Spice Girls.,2
RORY,Duran Duran.,2
LORELAI,Dido.,2
RORY,Olivia Newton John.,2
LORELAI,"The Macarena. You and Lane for hours and hours, for weeks on end.",2
RORY,"Hey, we were mocking. You can't mock the mocking.",2
LORELAI,All right. It's getting ugly. Let's stop.,2
RORY,Let's be friends again.,2
LORELAI,All right.,2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,Agh.,2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,The car won't start.,2
RORY,What happened?,2
LORELAI,I don't know. It's just dead. I turned the key and it makes a horrible sound.,2
RORY,What kind of sound?,2
LORELAI,"Like rrrar, rrrar, rrrar. You know, but less feminine.",2
RORY,That's the battery.,2
LORELAI,"Well, what did I ever do to make the battery mad?",2
RORY,"Let's see. You've kept the radio on all night, k*lling the battery. You've kept the lights on all night, k*lling the battery. You've kept the door open, which keeps the ceiling light on, all night, k*lling the battery.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, well then I've done multiple things to make the battery mad.",2
RORY,You gonna walk?,2
LORELAI,I'm wearing heels.,2
RORY,Change your shoes.,2
LORELAI,I'd have to change my outfit.,2
RORY,Change your outfit.,2
LORELAI,I'd have to walk upstairs.,2
RORY,Suddenly I'm living with Zsa Zsa Gabor.,2
LORELAI,I'm gonna call Michel.,2
RORY,This thing is too small.,2
MICHELorelai,Independence Inn.,2
LORELAI,Hold on Michel. That backpack is not too small.,2
RORY,It's miniscule.,2
LORELAI,Just take your schoolbooks and leave some of the other books.,2
RORY,I need all of my other books.,2
LORELAI,You don't need all of these.,2
RORY,I think I do.,2
LORELAI,Edna St. Vincent Milay?,2
RORY,That's my bus book.,2
LORELAI,Uh huh. What's the Faulkner?,2
RORY,My other bus book.,2
LORELAI,So just take one bus book.,2
RORY,"No, the Milay is a biography, and sometimes if I'm on the bus and I pull out a biography and I think to myself, 'Well, I don't really feel like reading about a person's life right now' then I'll switch to the novel, and then sometimes if I'm not into the novel, I'll switch back.",2
LORELAI,Hmm. Still there Michel?,2
RORY,"Yes, I. . .",2
LORELAI,Hold on. What is the Gore Vidal?,2
RORY,"Oh, that's my lunch book.",2
LORELAI,Uh huh. So lose the Vidal or the Faulkner. You don't need two novels.,2
RORY,Vidal's essays.,2
LORELAI,Uh huh. But the Eudora Welty's not essays or a biography.,2
RORY,Right.,2
LORELAI,"So it's another novel, lose it!",2
RORY,Unh uh. It's short stories.,2
LORELAI,Ugh. This is a sickness. Michel.,2
RORY,I am growing very old.,2
LORELAI,Come pick me up?,2
MICHELorelai,I am already here.,2
LORELAI,Put Carol on the desk and come pick me up.,2
MICHELorelai,I am not speaking to Carol. She ate my low-fat cheese.,2
LORELAI,"Michel, come pick me up and I will buy you some cheese.",2
MICHELorelai,Low-fat cheese.,2
LORELAI,Low-fat cheese.,2
MICHELorelai,Low-fat American cheese.,2
LORELAI,Low-fat American cheese.,2
MICHELorelai,And a meringue cookie.,2
LORELAI,Just get over here.,2
MICHELorelai,Fine.,2
RORY,"Ha! I made it all fit. Edna, Bill, Gore and Eudora, all safe and sound.",2
LORELAI,Cool. That's your French book.,2
RORY,"Hmm? Oh, I know. I'm carrying my French book.",2
LORELAI,Mm hmm. You so thought that French book was already in there.,2
RORY,I did not.,2
LORELAI,You have a problem.,2
RORY,No I don't.,2
LORELAI,You're gonna tip over from the weight of that backpack.,2
RORY,No I'm not.,2
LORELAI,,2
VERDINAS,I startled you. I didn't mean to.,2
RORY,,2
VERDINAS,"I'm Mrs. Verdinas, the guidance counselor. Your name's Rory, isn't it? Rory Gilmore?",2
RORY,,2
VERDINAS,Hello. I'd love to sit and talk to you. Can we do that?,2
RORY,,2
VERDINAS,How about after you finish your lunch?,2
RORY,,2
VERDINAS,I think soon would be good.,2
RORY,,2
VERDINAS,We'll talk about it then.,2
RORY,,2
VERDINAS,See you in a little bit.,2
RORY,,2
VERDINAS,"Come in . Hello Rory, have a seat.",2
RORY,,2
VERDINAS,So don't worry about being late for your next class. I'll write you a note if you are.,2
RORY,,2
VERDINAS,I know from your record you're a stickler for punctuality.,2
RORY,,2
VERDINAS,Why don't we get to the reason I asked you here?,2
RORY,,2
VERDINAS,"Headmaster Charleston brought you to my attention a few weeks ago. He's worried, and after observing you a bit, I'm worried too.",2
RORY,,2
VERDINAS,We've been concerned about your social behavior here at school.,2
RORY,,2
VERDINAS,You don't seem to interact much with the other students.,2
RORY,,2
VERDINAS,"But rarely outside of class. At lunch, you're always by yourself.",2
RORY,,2
VERDINAS,"And that walkman, it makes you very unapproachable.",2
RORY,,2
VERDINAS,And you almost jumped out of your skin. What does that tell you?,2
RORY,,2
VERDINAS,"Denying a problem doesn't solve a problem, Rory. Unless something changes, this could affect your future.",2
RORY,,2
VERDINAS,"You know, it's not. Rory, when we make recommendations to universities on behalf of a student, that student's social skills are a big part of it. Now, I assume you want to go to a university?",2
RORY,,2
VERDINAS,"Well, universities do not look kindly on loners.",2
RORY,,2
VERDINAS,"Really? Well, what do you think a loner is?",2
RORY,,2
VERDINAS,"Loners come in all different shapes and sizes, even pretty girls. Just try to improve Rory. Mix it up with others. You may even enjoy it. Start with lunch.",2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,So what does she expect you to do?,2
RORY,She said mix it up.,2
LORELAI,"Mix it up, what does that mean?",2
RORY,"I guess that means going up to strange kids at school and saying, 'Hey, mind if I awkwardly butt in where I don't belong and don't want to be?'",2
LORELAI,The whole thing's ridiculous. Chilton is a cult.,2
KIRK,"Lorelai, do you know what this is?",2
LORELAI,"Um, no.",2
KIRK,Damn.,2
RORY,I don't know. Maybe there is something wrong with me.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, don't say that.",2
RORY,"Maybe I am a loner. I mean, you were mocking my backpack today. I might just be one step away from carrying a mysterious duffel bag.",2
LORELAI,"Oh no, no you don't. Don't you go doubting who you are or how you should be. How dare that woman do this to you!",2
RORY,It wasn't just her. The whole meeting was Charleston's suggestion.,2
LORELAI,"Well, good. It's time I called on old Schnickelfritz Charleston to tell him to stop messing with my kid's mind.",2
RORY,Mom.,2
LORELAI,"No, I'm sorry. I don't like this. Schools like Chilton try to stamp out every vestige of individuality and I'm not gonna let that happen.",2
KIRK,"It's all fixed. I found a loose terminal. I reconnected the battery and jumped it, so it's set to go.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, thanks Kirk.",2
KIRK,And I'm not gonna charge you for the time I spent stuck underneath the car.,2
LORELAI,That's great Kirk.,2
KIRK,"And I just want you to know that I overheard, and you're absolutely right. I carried a duffel bag and ate lunch by myself my entire school career, and I turned out just fine.",2
LORELAI,,2
SECRETARY,Ms. Gilmore is here.,2
LORELAI,Hello Mr. Charleston.,2
HEADMASTERory,"Ms. Gilmore, so good to see you.",2
LORELAI,It's good to be here.,2
HEADMASTERory,"You know, I checked my records to remind myself why I asked you in only to discover that you had actually called for this meeting.",2
LORELAI,Yes I did.,2
HEADMASTERory,I'm surprised. We don't see you often. We'd forgotten what you'd looked like.,2
LORELAI,"Well, I'm pretty much the same. Rosy cheeks, strong of bone, sly of wit.",2
HEADMASTERory,How nice. So why did you want to see me?,2
LORELAI,"Well, I wanted to talk to you about Rory and uh, this ridiculous accusation about her being a loner and how that's somehow something bad.",2
HEADMASTERory,"Well, it is bad.",2
LORELAI,"No, it's not bad, it's just her. I raised Rory to do what she wants as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else. And I don't see how her reading a book or listening to a walkman is hurting anyone.",2
HEADMASTERory,It's hurting her.,2
LORELAI,I respectfully disagree.,2
HEADMASTERory,"That doesn't surprise me, based on my research.",2
LORELAI,What research?,2
HEADMASTERory,"When I saw your name on the appointment list, I decided to have a look at the file.",2
LORELAI,"Ah yes, Rory's file's been of a lot of interest to you guys lately, hasn't it?",2
HEADMASTERory,I wasn't talking about Rory's file. I was talking about yours.,2
LORELAI,I have a file?,2
HEADMASTERory,You most certainly do.,2
LORELAI,It's tiny.,2
HEADMASTERory,It's very thin.,2
LORELAI,"Well that's good, right? It means I haven't gotten into a lot of trouble.",2
HEADMASTERory,"On the contrary, a thin file for a parent indicates lack of participation.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, now wait a minute. I've participated in stuff.",2
HEADMASTERory,You attended the bake sale.,2
LORELAI,And I sold stuff.,2
HEADMASTERory,Then promptly left.,2
LORELAI,I was busy.,2
HEADMASTERory,Without fraternizing with the other Chilton parents at all.,2
LORELAI,"Busy, busy, busy like a really tall bee.",2
HEADMASTERory,"Like mother, like daughter.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, hold on.",2
HEADMASTERory,"Ms. Gilmore, active participation in Chilton activities for a parent is vitally important.",2
LORELAI,But ,2
HEADMASTERory,This is a list of organizations sponsored by Chilton. Parent groups dedicated to certain specific tasks.,2
LORELAI,"Uh, my ",2
HEADMASTERory,Any one of them would be honored by your participation.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, my schedule is ",2
HEADMASTERory,"We're all tremendously busy, Ms. Gilmore. I hope you're not too busy to do what's best for you or what's best for Rory, are you?",2
LORELAI,No.,2
HEADMASTERory,Excellent. Let us know what it will be.,2
LORELAI,"I will. Oh, may I go?",2
HEADMASTERory,"Yes, you may.",2
LORELAI,Okay.,2
HEADMASTERory,I'm glad you came in today. It was a good idea.,2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,Hey.,2
LORELAI,Hey.,2
RORY,Hey.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, look Fat Albert. Get me a soda, will you?",2
RORY,"Mom, what are you doing here? You were supposed to meet me in my Latin class after meet ing with Headmaster Charleston.",2
LORELAI,"Oh my God. I was. I totally forgot. Ugh, I'm so sorry.",2
RORY,"Mom, come on, what happened. Did you talk to him?",2
LORELAI,"I did. I told him that he was completely out of line with this treatment of you, that you are not a loner freak, you have plenty of friends, and you don't own a long black leather Matrix coat, and they should fall down on their kneesocks everyday that you deign to show up at that loser school.",2
RORY,And?,2
LORELAI,And then he yelled at me.,2
RORY,He what?,2
LORELAI,He pulled out a file and told me I was a bad Chilton mom.,2
RORY,He did not.,2
LORELAI,And that I don't participate in school activities.,2
RORY,"Well, you work.",2
LORELAI,And I don't make posters.,2
RORY,You have no artistic capabilities.,2
LORELAI,And I don't chaperone school dances.,2
RORY,Does he know that you got pregnant at sixteen?,2
LORELAI,Basically I'm not doing my part to help further your educational future.,2
RORY,So we both got busted.,2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
RORY,Great.,2
LORELAI,Now I have to pick a group or a cause or sponsor a club or something.,2
RORY,This sucks.,2
LORELAI,"But hey, I've been thinking. I mean, the whole reason we did this Chilton thing is for you to get into Harvard, right?",2
RORY,Right.,2
LORELAI,"And these fanatics that run your school, they're the ones that write the letters to the fancy colleges saying things like, 'Hey she's keen, look at her' or 'Have you seen the L tattooed on her forehead, 'cause it sure is a big one.'",2
RORY,So you're saying we should just go along with this?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, go along with it. Talk to some kids, I'll hang out with their moms, and we'll get into Harvard, take over the world, then buy Chilton and turn it into a rave club. What do you say, deal?",2
RORY,Deal.,2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,Hey.,2
FRANCIE,Hey.,2
RORY,"There's a bad draft over there where I usually sit. It's kind of like a big downward gust. It's not exactly 'Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore', but it's still pretty darn uncomfortable, especially when you're just gotten your hair to behave. So can I sit here?",2
FRANCIE,"Uhh, yeah.",2
RORY,Thanks. Nice table. It's much more level than the one over there.,2
FRANCIE,Your name is Lori.,2
RORY,Rory.,2
FRANCIE,"Right, Rory.",2
RORY,What's yours?,2
IVY,Francie.,2
RORY,You're Francie?,2
IVY,"No, she's Francie, I'm Ivy.",2
RORY,Francie's spokesman.,2
FRANCIE,"Well, I am a very important person, and everyone knows very important people never speak for themselves.",2
RORY,"I did not know that, but I do now.",2
FRANCIE,"That's Dijur, Lily, Seline, Lana, Asia, Anna, and Lem.",2
RORY,Lem.,2
LEM,Short for Lemon.,2
RORY,Oh sure.,2
FRANCIE,We were just discussing homecoming. Thoughts?,2
RORY,"Great movie. Oh wait, that was Coming Home. Sorry.",2
FRANCIE,I truly believe the whole homecoming dance ritual's be put to sleep.,2
IVY,Or at least assigned a new color scheme.,2
FRANCIE,"Hmm. Rory, huh? Do they call you Ror?",2
RORY,Not unless provoked.,2
IVY,No nickname?,2
RORY,"Actually, Rory is a nickname. My full name is Lorelai.",2
LEM,Lorelai. That's a weird name.,2
RORY,"Well, Lem, what can I say?",2
FRANCIE,Sounds southern. Are you a belle?,2
RORY,"Uh, no, but apparently I comman d them.",2
FRANCIE,,2
RORY,God! You're like a pop up book from hell.,2
PARIS,You were sitting with the Puffs. How did you do it?,2
RORY,The who?,2
PARIS,"The Puffs, the Chilton Puffs. You were at their table and I wanna know how.",2
RORY,"I don't know, I just sat down.",2
PARIS,"Nobody just sits down with them, you have to be invited.",2
RORY,"Paris, it's not the cosa nostra.",2
PARIS,"No, they're the Puffs, the most influential sorority at Chilton.",2
RORY,Chilton has sororities?,2
PARIS,"Only ten worth mentioning, and the Puffs, they have been number one for at least the last fifty years. My mother was a Puff, my aunt was a Puff.",2
RORY,I thought only colleges had sororities.,2
PARIS,"And the connection you make with the Puffs, they last the rest of your life. My cousin Maddie got her internship at the Supreme Co urt because of Sandra Day O'Connor.",2
RORY,Sandra Day O'Connor was a Puff?,2
PARIS,"Yes. She was puffed in 1946, became the president in '47, and in '48 she actually moved the group to the very table you sat at today.",2
RORY,God.,2
PARIS,"It was quite a controversial move at the time, but she was just that powerful.",2
RORY,I had no idea.,2
PARIS,What did you say about me?,2
RORY,What?,2
PARIS,Did you tell them you hated me?,2
RORY,I didn't mention you.,2
PARIS,Because I have been k*lling myself trying to get invited in. I spent all of last year sucking up to Francine Jarvis.,2
RORY,You mean Francie?,2
PARIS,You call her Francie?,2
RORY,"Oh, no, someone else did.",2
PARIS,"I have helped her with her homework, secured her a prime spot in the parking lot, organized her locker, scrunched up the plastic strands on her pom-poms to make them fluffy. I have done everything except give her a manicure, and by God, if I had any talent with an orange stick, Iwould've done that too.",2
RORY,"I know I'm not the first one to say it to you, but you're insane.",2
PARIS,"Okay, look, I know you and me, we. . .",2
RORY,Shouldn't be around each other armed.,2
PARIS,"Yes. But you have to understand. I have to get into that group, I just have to. My family's name an d reputation, not to mention my entire future, all depend on me getting into that group.",2
RORY,"It's just a clique, that's all.",2
PARIS,"Look, all I'm asking is please don't say anything horrible about me. Don't tell them that you hate me.",2
RORY,"Paris, come on, I'm not in their group. They don't care what I say.",2
PARIS,"They let you sit at their table all the way through lunch, you're in.",2
RORY,Paris.,2
PARIS,,2
LORELAI,Who the hell names their kid Lemon?,2
RORY,Someone really into citrus.,2
LORELAI,"Ugh, crazy crazy people.",2
RORY,It's just so weird that the one table I sit down at is home to the secret society.,2
LORELAI,I know. It's like waking up one day and realizing that everyone else in your family can pull their face off.,2
RORY,"Yes, it's exactly like that.",2
MAID,Your mother would like you to head out to the patio. We're barbecuing tonight.,2
LORELAI,Thanks.,2
RORY,Does Grandma have a barbecue?,2
LORELAI,"I don't know. Maybe she keeps it in the secret room with the paper napkins and the mismatched sheets. Wow, she really is barbecuing.",2
RORY,"Hey, cool!",2
LORELAI,"What's up, Poppin' Fresh?",2
RORY,"Ooh, corn!",2
LORELAI,Nice!,2
LORELAI,Thank you.,2
RORY,Mm.,2
LORELAI,Mmm.,2
EMILY,"What is this, a refugee camp? Come inside and eat at the table.",2
LORELAI,"Mom, the whole point of barbecuing is to eat outside.",2
EMILY,"Animals eat outside. Human beings eat inside with napkins and utensils. If you want to eat outside, go hunt down a gazelle. Make your decision, I'll be inside.",2
LORELAI,What are the odds of finding a gazelle around here?,2
RORY,Slim to none.,2
LORELAI,,2
EMILY,I'm extremely disappointed in you Lorelai.,2
LORELAI,"Hold on Mom. Okay, go ahead.",2
EMILY,I had lunch with Bitty Charleston today and she told me what happened with you and the headmaster.,2
LORELAI,"What? Geez, does that woman do nothing all day but hide under his desk with a tape recorder?",2
EMILY,"After all we've gone through to get Rory in that school, and then you humiliate all of us by not being involved. That is just incomprehensible.",2
LORELAI,"Hey, she wasn't involved either.",2
RORY,"Wow, just sitting here.",2
EMILY,"You are a grown up, you have to set an example. If she's not involved with school, then shelearned it from you.",2
RORY,Yeah.,2
EMILY,"How hard is it to help out just once in awhile? Join a group, attend a meeting, and all for the sake of ",2
LORELAI,"Mom, stop already, please. I have joined a group, okay?",2
EMILY,You have?,2
RORY,You have?,2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
EMILY,Which one?,2
LORELAI,"I'm gonna join the Booster Club, mmkay? The Booster Club, I'm going to boost.",2
EMILY,"Well, the Boosters are a very fine organization.",2
LORELAI,That's why I picked 'em.,2
EMILY,They do very good work for the school.,2
LORELAI,All went into the picking process.,2
EMILY,,2
AVA,"Well, we're certainly not doing it like last year.",2
GINGERory,"God, was that awful!",2
MENA,It wasn't that bad.,2
AVA,"Wasn't that bad? Mena, by the time we got finished paying for everybody's stomach to be pumped, there was no money left to buy the new bleachers.",2
MENA,But the salsa band was wonderful.,2
GINGERory,This is giving me a mig raine. I just ,2
AUBREY,I vote we take a break.,2
LORELAI,Hi. Sorry to interrupt.,2
AVA,It's all right. Can we help you?,2
LORELAI,"Uh, yes, actually. . . this isn't the Booster Club, is it?",2
AVA,Yes it is.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, thank God you're not wearing the sweatshirts.",2
AVA,Excuse me?,2
LORELAI,"Uh, you know what, never mind. I'm Lorelai Gilmore, sorry I'm late.",2
AVA,"Oh please, you haven't missed a thing. So far, we've had coffee, debated Carolyn Masters' nose job ",2
MENA,Too pug.,2
AUBREY,Too smushed.,2
GINGERory,Who cares?,2
AVA,And we started arguing about our fall fundraiser.,2
AUBREY,I suggested we take a break.,2
AVA,"I ignored the suggestion, and now here we are. You're all up to date. Have a seat.",2
MENA,Lorelai Gilmore. So you're Emily's daughter?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah. You know my mother?",2
MENA,"Oh, very well. We're on the philharmonic committee together. She told me to keep an eye out for you.",2
LORELAI,"Huh, that's nice.",2
MENA,She wasn't sure you'd show up.,2
LORELAI,"So, uh, fall fundrasier, what do we do?",2
AVA,"Well, last year we had the usual luncheon with silent auction and a salsa band.",2
MENA,A terrific salsa band.,2
AVA,"But every guest ended up in the hospital with food poisoning before the auction even started, and we wound up losing money.",2
LORELAI,Whoops.,2
AVA,"Yes, it's quite a whoops, isn't it? Anyhow, this year we decided to do a fashion show.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, that sounds fun.",2
AVA,"Yes, well, Aubrey here works at Saks.",2
AUBREY,"Uh, used to work at Saks.",2
AVA,"Oh, sorry. Used to work at Saks, and she got several designers to donate their clothes, so now we're just trying to find a suitable caterer and location and someone to plan the event.",2
GINGERory,"Oh, it's all going very well.",2
MENA,I still say we approach Chateau Mimsy.,2
AVA,"That space is too small, Mena.",2
AUBREY,"How about something more young and fun? You know, my stepdaughter Kimberly...",2
AVA,Sarah.,2
AUBREY,"Right, Sarah. Sarah. Anyhow, she told me about this new club called The Digs ",2
MENA,She's been married a month and still can't remember the names of her stepchildren.,2
AUBREY," so the booths are like in these pits, and then there's sand everywhere ",2
GINGERory,Stop her.,2
AVA,I don't think that's exactly what we're looking for.,2
LORELAI,"Um, I run an inn.",2
AVA,You do?,2
MENA,Which one?,2
LORELAI,"The Independence Inn, it's in Stars Hollow.",2
AVA,"Oh, I've been there. It's lovely.",2
LORELAI,"And we have a terrific chef who's never once hospitalized an entire function. And, well, I mean, I don't know exactly what you're looking for, but we do functions there all the time.",2
AVA,Who's your function coordinator?,2
LORELAI,"I am, actually. And since it's for charity, I could get you a really good price.",2
AVA,"I'm sorry, I forgot to ask you, are you from heaven?",2
LORELAI,You like the idea?,2
AVA,"I love the idea. I love it so much, we can finally take that break Aubrey's been dying for.",2
AVA,"Well, this is very exciting.",2
LORELAI,Oh.,2
AVA,"Would you mind if I come out there tomorrow to take a look at the place? You know, make sure it's big enough for the runway.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, sure, I'll be there all day. So, a fashion show, huh? Are we gonna get any famous models?",2
AVA,Excuse me?,2
LORELAI,"You know, to model the clothes. Any chance I'm finally gonna get to see Kate Moss eat something?",2
AVA,"Oh, no no. We're the models.",2
LORELAI,We? Who's we?,2
AVA,"We, the women in this room. Me, you, we.",2
LORELAI,Me?,2
AVA,Yes.,2
LORELAI,Oh well ,2
AVA,"By the way, welcome to the Boosters. We're thrilled to have you.",2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,"Ha ha, yours is worse than mine.",2
LORELAI,"Ugh, they totally just snuck that modeling thing in.",2
RORY,"Hmm, my mom's a model. Maybe you'll get to date Leonardo DiCaprio now.",2
LORELAI,"Plus, now I have to plan the whole stupid thing.",2
RORY,"Lorelai Gilmore. Nope, doesn't sound model-y enough. You need something that stands out more. How about Waffle? We could call you Waffle and say you're from Belgium?",2
LORELAI,"Okay, I'm crabby. I need to do something about it. Hey Mom.",2
EMILY,"Well, hello.",2
LORELAI,"So I went to my first Booster meeting last night, did Bitty tell you?",2
EMILY,"No, she did not.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, well, maybe she's still stuck under that desk. You might want to send someone out there to look.",2
EMILY,"Well, it's certainly nice to hear you finally getting involved.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, in fact we're planning a charity fashion show next weekend, and I volunteered to organize it.",2
EMILY,"Well, good for you.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, and since I know how concerned you are about how Rory's perceived at Chilton, Iknew you'd want to be involved somehow, so you're gonna be one of the models.",2
EMILY,Excuse me?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, so it's next Saturday, be there at four, and we'll provide hair and makeup.",2
EMILY,"Lorelai, you can't be serious.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, and we'll need your measurements also.",2
EMILY,This is ridiculous.,2
LORELAI,"Mom. You said you wanted me to be involved. Well, I'm involved, now don't you want to do your part to ensure Rory's future?",2
EMILY,All right.,2
LORELAI,Start measuring.,2
RORY,You feel better now?,2
LORELAI,,2
FRANCIE,"Sit with us, please.",2
RORY,"Um, okay.",2
FRANCIE,Here she comes.,2
LEM,Welcome.,2
FRANCIE,We talked. We find you fascinating.,2
IVY,Like the monkey habitat.,2
FRANCIE,So we've decided to extend an invite to you. You can eat here anytime you like.,2
RORY,"Wow, that's nice of you, thanks. So can I ask about this whole sorority thing?",2
FRANCIE,Pardon?,2
IVY,Sorori-what?,2
RORY,I thought you guys were ,2
LEM,We have no idea what you're talking about.,2
FRANCIE,"That's right. After all, what's the point of a secret society if it's not a secret?",2
RORY,The whole school apparently knows about it.,2
FRANCIE,"Well, no one has proof. It's just folklore.",2
IVY,Like Snow White and Rose Red.,2
FRANCIE,Or Mariah Carey's crackup.,2
LEM,Have you heard her fan message recently? She's fine and is currently staring at a really beautiful rainbow.,2
IVY,"Survivor, hello.",2
FRANCIE,Friend of yours?,2
RORY,Paris? Oh well ,2
IVY,Too intense.,2
LEM,Way too intense.,2
FRANCIE,She comes from a long line of us though.,2
IVY,I hate nepotism.,2
LEM,"It, however, does make the world go round.",2
RORY,"You know, Paris, while, yes, a little intense, is also very smart.",2
FRANCIE,"So I drop a box of matches on the floor, she can tell me how many there are?",2
RORY,"She's editor of the paper. Amazing writer, plus funny.",2
IVY,She's funny?,2
RORY,"Oh yeah. Hilarious. I mean, the times that we have spent laughing together. I tell ya, she's a regular Gary Muledeer.",2
FRANCIE,"She asked you to talk her up, didn't she?",2
RORY,"No, not at all.",2
IVY,Right.,2
RORY,"No, really. I think she's actually thinking of joining another non-existent group.",2
FRANCIE,What?,2
IVY,But her family's fully puffed.,2
RORY,"I don't know. Maybe I heard her wrong, but I think that's what I heard her say.",2
FRANCIE,A voluntary defector.,2
IVY,Francie.,2
FRANCIE,I know. Paris?,2
PARIS,Yeah?,2
FRANCIE,"I think the wall can hold itself up just fine, don't you?",2
PARIS,What?,2
FRANCIE,You should sit.,2
PARIS,Sit?,2
FRANCIE,Here.,2
PARIS,Sit there?,2
IVY,Or here.,2
LEM,Or anywhere for that matter.,2
PARIS,Well ,2
RORY,"Unless you've got somewhere else to be. Another table, perhaps.",2
PARIS,Another table?,2
FRANCIE,"No, you have to sit, right here. Come, come.",2
PARIS,"Uh, okay. I guess I can sit, for a little while anyhow.",2
FRANCIE,"Okay, so, have we discussed homecoming yet?",2
IVY,Not to my knowledge.,2
FRANCIE,,2
LORELAI,"Uh, in the dining room, and don't drip water on the floor please. Michel, did the ",2
MICHELorelai,Five minutes ago.,2
LORELAI,What about the ,2
MICHELorelai,"He brought the wrong color, I sent him back.",2
LORELAI,What? When will he be ,2
MICHELorelai,"Twenty minutes tops, or I told him I will hunt him down and shave his beard.",2
LORELAI,"Good, now we need the uh ",2
MICHELorelai,"Oh, yes, thank you for reminding me.",2
LORELAI,Anything ,2
MICHELorelai,No.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, well, I'm going in the dining room. Come and get me if you actually need me to finish a sentence for you.",2
MICHELorelai,,2
LORELAI,"Hey, how's it coming?",2
MAN,Working on it.,2
LORELAI,This cannot tilt.,2
MAN,I know this.,2
LORELAI,Women in heels will be walking on it. Make it not tilt.,2
SOOKIE,The lettuce is dry.,2
LORELAI,What does that mean?,2
SOOKIE,How attached are you to salad?,2
LORELAI,It's free to see anyone it wants.,2
SOOKIE,I don't want to make a salad with dry lettuce.,2
LORELAI,What's the alternative?,2
SOOKIE,I can make soup.,2
LORELAI,Fine.,2
SOOKIE,"Okay, great.",2
LORELAI,"Ah, Sookie?",2
SOOKIE,Yeah?,2
LORELAI,Did we pay for the lettuce already?,2
SOOKIE,"Yes, we did.",2
LORELAI,See if you can put it in the soup.,2
SOOKIE,Gotcha.,2
LORELAI,Okay.,2
LORELAI,"Ah, thank God! You brought Bert.",2
LUKE,Right here.,2
LORELAI,"My men, follow me.",2
LUKE,"By the way, you do tell people that you're the one that named my toolbox, right?",2
LORELAI,"Toolbox, dirty.",2
LUKE,Oh geez.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, um, move.",2
MAN,What?,2
LORELAI,I want Luke to look at it.,2
MAN,"Hey, I put this thing together.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, and I loved your work in Pisa, now get out of the way, please.",2
LUKE,"Okay, so what seems to be the problem?",2
LORELAI,Uh ha! The problem is. . .that's not funny.,2
LUKE,"I like it when you're stressed. Oh man, he put this thing up all wrong.",2
LORELAI,Can you fix it?,2
LUKE,"I don't know, I'll see.",2
LORELAI,You can fix it.,2
LUKE,"You can say it all you want, it doesn't make it true.",2
LORELAI,You can fix it.,2
LUKE,"Not with you hovering, I can't.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, I'm leaving. You can fix it. Oh, Ava, hi.",2
AVA,"God, the place looks wonderful.",2
LORELAI,Thank you. Let me show you to the room where we're all getting ready.,2
AVA,All right.,2
LORELAI,Fix it yet?,2
LUKE,The moron used the wrong supports.,2
LORELAI,Please tell me you can fix it.,2
LUKE,"If I told you I couldn't fix it, would you accept that?",2
LORELAI,No.,2
LUKE,I can fix it.,2
LORELAI,"Thank you. So we're right back here  Uh, Ava, the room's right back here.",2
AVA,Him.,2
LORELAI,Who?,2
AVA,"There, man with tools, who is that?",2
LORELAI,"Oh, that's Luke.",2
AVA,"Luke, I like Luke.",2
LORELAI,What?,2
AVA,"Oh, he's adorable. And he looks strong, is he strong?",2
LORELAI,"Oh I don't know. I don't think he's gonna be in a sideshow anytime soon, but he can get the lid off a pickle jar.",2
AVA,Is he single?,2
LORELAI,"Well, uh yeah, he is single.",2
AVA,What kind of women does he like?,2
LORELAI,"I don't know, ones with heads. You know, I don't really know what Luke's taste in women is.",2
EMILY,Lorelai.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, um, Ava, why don't you go on in the back, go to the right, you'll find the dressing room, I'll be there in a sec. Hi Mom.",2
EMILY,The place isn't nearly done yet.,2
LORELAI,"Ugh. Mom, why don't you just go on in the back and get ready.",2
EMILY,Did you see the clothes? What am I wearing?,2
LORELAI,I don't know. I just had them hang them up in the room,2
EMILY,"God, I hope they're not tasteless or zebra striped or spandex.",2
LORELAI,"Well, one good way to find out is to go on back and take a peak.",2
EMILY,You have to get ready too.,2
LORELAI,I'll be there in a sec.,2
EMILY,"If I'm doing this, you're doing this. I mean it.",2
LORELAI,Oh! You fixed it!,2
LUKE,"Yup, for the time being, but I'm gonna stick around for awhile just to make sure nothing happens.",2
LORELAI,Oh. Okay.,2
LUKE,What?,2
LORELAI,What?,2
LUKE,You don't want me to stick around?,2
LORELAI,I didn't say that.,2
LUKE,Is there a reason I shouldn't stick around?,2
LORELAI,Are you listening? It's fine.,2
LUKE,"Because I'm just doing this for you. I mean, if this thing goes and someone breaks their neck ",2
LORELAI,"Luke, stick around.",2
LUKE,,2
LORELAI,Hey. Why aren't you dressed yet?,2
EMILY,I was waiting for you.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, my God, you're a paranoid woman.",2
EMILY,I'm Emily Gilmore.,2
LADY,"Okay, here you go. Where's Lorelai Gilmore?",2
LORELAI,"Oh, right here.",2
LADY,You two are together.,2
LORELAI,What?,2
LADY,You're the mother-daughter team.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, no I'm ",2
LADY,"I have outfits for one mother-daughter team, your names are on the outfits, you're it.",2
LORELAI,,2
LADY,,2
MENA,"Well, I must say, this was definitely better than the salsa band.",2
GINGERory,"Oh, people loved it, did you hear them? God, who picked that music?",2
LORELAI,"Um, that'd be me.",2
GINGERory,It was terrific. The whole thing was terrific.,2
LORELAI,"Well, thank you.",2
MENA,"Oh, and hiring that actor to play a horrible, rude, annoying Frenchman. What a riot!",2
LORELAI,"Oh yeah, I thought that'd be fun.",2
GINGERory,"You know, if you plan all these damn things, we wouldn't have to have anymore of those stupid meet ings.",2
LORELAI,Oh come on. Don't you want to see how long it actually takes Aubrey to finally learn that kid's name?,2
GINGERory,"Eh, you're right. Okay, I'll see you at the next meeting. Great job, really. It's the best event we've ever had.",2
LORELAI,Well thanks Ginger. Bye Mena.,2
MENA,Buh bye.,2
LORELAI,What are you looking so ha-ha about?,2
EMILY,I'm not looking ha-ha.,2
LORELAI,Yes you are.,2
EMILY,All right. Whatever you say.,2
LORELAI,"Come on Mom, fess up.",2
EMILY,Big success tonight.,2
LORELAI,Seemed to be.,2
EMILY,The ladies were thrilled. They adore you.,2
LORELAI,"Yes, well, that's because I'm adorable.",2
EMILY,Funny isn't it?,2
LORELAI,What's funny?,2
EMILY,,2
RORY,Is that you?,2
LORELAI,Nope.,2
RORY,How was it?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, fine. It ran smoothly, and the food was amazing. Michel only made three people cry.",2
RORY,How was the fashion show?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, you know, I walked up and down the ramp, looked pouty and sexy, now I'm ready for rehab. I brought you some Bo oster cake.",2
RORY,Put it in the fridge please.,2
LORELAI,Okay.,2
RORY,How's Grandma?,2
LORELAI,"Uh, mmm, good.",2
RORY,I'm assuming that's your piece of cake and mine is safely in the fridge.,2
LORELAI,"Hmm, you're cute.",2
RORY,Uh huh. So what'd you wear?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, look at the time. I'm going to bed.",2
RORY,Nobody took a picture of you?,2
LORELAI,"Uh, no. Can you believe that?",2
RORY,You're holding onto that purse mighty tightly there missy.,2
LORELAI,"Yes, well, I really love this purse.",2
RORY,You have pictures in there.,2
LORELAI,You calling your mother a liar?,2
RORY,Yes I am.,2
LORELAI,"Mm, well, that's why I ate your cake.",2
RORY,Oh my God!,2
LORELAI,Be nice.,2
RORY,You look like Nancy Reagan.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, now how is that nice?",2
RORY,"I don't believe this. You look so completely different. Elegant, understated.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, well I was wearing underwear with propellers on them if that makes you feel any better. I'm going to bed.",2
RORY,I'll send the Secret Service up.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, uh, by the way, I would put on your good pajamas, you know, the cute ones with the cakes on them. And brush your hair and put on a little lip gloss.",2
RORY,Why?,2
LORELAI,You're being kidnapped tonight.,2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,I got a call today from Francie.,2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,"Yes, she said that she and her friends were gonna come in while you're sleeping, wake you up, kidnap you and take you out to breakfast in your pajamas.",2
RORY,Why would they do that?,2
LORELAI,Apparently it's fun.,2
RORY,"Well, that doesn't sound fun.",2
LORELAI,She told me to leave a key under the mat and some money on the coffee table.,2
RORY,And you said yes to this insanity?,2
LORELAI,"Hey, I told you not to become a soc, but you didn't listen.",2
RORY,"I can't believe that you are going to let a group of strange girls come traipsing in here and take away your only child, your precious baby girl, and off to God knows where in the middle of the night.",2
LORELAI,"If it's someplace with doughnuts, bring me one, okay?",2
RORY,Fine.,2
LORELAI,Uhh! Hey!,2
RORY,Christmas Cards.,2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,"Mom, my kidnappers are here.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, have fun.",2
FRANCIE,Hit the lights.,2
IVY,I can't find it.,2
FRANCIE,Shh.,2
ALLorelai,Surprise!,2
RORY,What's going on?,2
FRANCIE,Rise and shine.,2
IVY,"You can grab shoes, but no socks.",2
RORY,"Oh wow, this is totally unexpected. I'm completely surprised.",2
FRANCIE,You looked it.,2
IVY,"Okay, let's move. We've still got a couple more girls to get.",2
PARIS,"So, that's how you look when you've just woken up?",2
RORY,"Um, yeah.",2
PARIS,,2
FRANCIE,"Okay, just a little further.",2
GIRLorelai,Ow!,2
IVY,Shh!,2
GIRLorelai,Sorry.,2
FRANCIE,"Okay, that's far enough. Ladies, here on the spot, tonight in this place, where so many others have come before you, we invite you to join us.",2
IVY,"Ladies, remove your blindfolds.",2
RORY,We're at Chilton.,2
FRANCIE,Keys please.,2
RORY,What are we doing at Chilton?,2
PARIS,Will you please be quiet. We are being puffed.,2
FRANCIE,What you are about to do and what you are about to say will remain forever between the memb ers of the Puffs and only the memb ers of the Puffs.,2
RORY,This is the headmaster's office. How did she get the keys? I'm sure he didn't give them to her.,2
PARIS,Stop it. We are making very important social contacts here.,2
RORY,"Hey, I'm not looking for social contacts. I have friends. I'm fine.",2
PARIS,,2
FRANCIE,"The historical bell of Chilton, 120 years old. Every member of the Puffs has stood here under the cover of night to pledge her lifelong devotion to us. 'I pledge myself to the Puffs, loyal I'll always be, a P to start, 2 F's at the end, and a U sitting in between.'",2
RORY,"Anne Sexton, right?",2
FRANCIE,"Once you've finished your oath, you will ring the bell three times.",2
IVY,Rory?,2
RORY,Yeah?,2
IVY,You first.,2
RORY,"Um, I pledge myself to the Puffs ",2
IVY,You have to hold the candle.,2
RORY,"I pledge myself to the Puffs, loyal I'll always be ",2
FRANCIE,Sing out Louise.,2
RORY,"A P to start, 2 F's at the end, and a U sitting in between.",2
HEADMASTERory,,2
HEADMASTERory,"Disappointment, disillusionment, frustration, astonishment. I suppose you could say I am experiencing all of these emotions. Finding some of Chilton's best and brightest acting in such a destructive, immoral and illegal manner will make all of us think long and hard about the manner in which we are educating you girls. But that is all in the future. How do we handle this now? Well, suspension will be considered, detention and extra credit to maintain your current GPA standing will be a given.",2
RORY,This is unbelievable.,2
HEADMASTERory,"What was that, Miss Gilmore?",2
RORY,Nothing.,2
HEADMASTERory,"No, I distinctly heard you mumbling something in a rather disgruntled tone, I'd like to know what it was.",2
RORY,I said this is unbelievable.,2
HEADMASTERory,And why is this unbelievable Miss Gilmore?,2
RORY,Because I didn't even want to be here in the first place.,2
HEADMASTERory,"Oh, now Miss Gilmore ",2
RORY,"Things were going fine, my grades were good, I joined the paper. My routine was down.",2
HEADMASTERory,Your routine was ,2
RORY,"And I have friends. I have a steady boyfriend, and my mother and I are freakishly linked, and Lane and I have been best friends since kindergarten. But you don't see that because I don't live in this town, and if you don't see it then it must not be true. And you call me in here to lecture me because I'd rather read at lunch then endlessly discuss the euthanasia of homecoming.",2
HEADMASTERory,You're reading had ,2
RORY,"You told me an d you told my mother that I needed to socialize, and if I didn't, it would be frowned upon and it would hurt me getting into Harvard.",2
HEADMASTERory,"Well, yes, we did say that.",2
RORY,"So, I did it. I sat down at a table, a random table.",2
FRANCIE,Random?,2
RORY,"And the next thing I know, I'm being pulled out of my bed in the middle of the night and I'm blindfolded and then before I know it, I end up here with the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, reciting poetry and lighting candles, and now I'm gonna be suspended because I was trying to do what you told me? What's fair about that?",2
SECRETARY,"Headmaster Charleston, the parents are starting to arrive.",2
HEADMASTERory,"Thank you Mrs. Trager. All right ladies, we'll continue this conversation tomorrow and for many days after that. You may go. Miss Gilmore, I think that maybe you and I should talk some more.",2
RORY,About what?,2
HEADMASTERory,"About the fact that though I do feel it is important that students socialize, possibly we may have been a little hasty to judge in your case.",2
RORY,Really? So does that mean that you might reconsider my suspension?,2
HEADMASTERory,You're an excellent student. You deserve to go to Harvard. I wouldn't want to stand in the way of that. We'll talk tomorrow.,2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,"What happened? The reception on the phone sucked, and all I heard was 'Rory' and 'Chilton' and 'get down here.' Who's butt do I have to kick?",2
RORY,We didn't go to breakfast.,2
LORELAI,What are you talking about?,2
RORY,We came here. They broke into the Headmaster's office as the big initiation.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, those stupid girls.",2
RORY,Mm hmm. Part of the initiation was ringing a bell. So that's what I was doing when security showed up and they called you.,2
LORELAI,"That's what you got busted for, ringing a bell?",2
RORY,"Yeah, mm h mm.",2
LORELAI,That's it? Bell ringing?,2
RORY,Yes.,2
LORELAI,"Uh, were you at least smoking a Cuban cigar while you were doing it?",2
RORY,Mom.,2
LORELAI,"No, I mean, bad girl. How many times have I told you not to ring bells?",2
RORY,Let's go.,2
LORELAI,"They can dent or scratch and they make dogs crazy. Who do you think you are, the hunchback of Notre Dame? Are you French, are you circular, I don't think so.",2
RORY,I'm walking to the car now.,2
LORELAI,"Wait, hold on. How much trouble are you in? Should I go talk to the Headmaster?",2
RORY,"No, I think it's gonna be okay.",2
LORELAI,,2
LUKE,"Hey, good party yesterday.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, not bad.",2
LUKE,"Yeah, I like the new look. It was very high-class substitute teacher.",2
LORELAI,Exactly what I was going for.,2
LUKE,Coffee?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, to go.",2
LUKE,Okay.,2
LORELAI,"Hey Luke, uh, I feel a little weird even mentioning this to you.",2
LUKE,What?,2
LORELAI,"Yesterday I saw you talking to Ava, you know, she's in my booster club?",2
LUKE,"Yeah, I know who she is.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, good. Well, good. So anyhow, I saw you guys talking alone and it seemed kind of private, and she mentioned earlier that you didn't make her, you know, gag, so I just figured you guys were making some sort of plans to hang out. And see, the thing is, I just think it would be a little weird if you started dating a Chilton mom. Look, I know I have no right to say anything to you, but it's just, um, if you did date her, well, I'm in the Booster Club with her, which means that I'll hear things, and I don't know, it's just, I'd like to keep that Chilton life separate from my Stars Hollow life, so if there's any way that you could not date her, that would be really great.",2
LUKE,"Boy, I tell you, you've got nerve.",2
LORELAI,"Okay. Well, I know this is your private business.",2
LUKE,It is my private business.,2
LORELAI,You don't see any validity to my side at all?,2
LUKE,I am a grown man. You cannot tell me who to date.,2
LORELAI,"I'm not telling you who to date, I'm telling you who not to date.",2
LUKE,You can't tell me that either.,2
LORELAI,Look ,2
LUKE,"I will date who I like, and if that screws with your plans, then sorry. And if you don't wanna hear things, then don't listen.",2
LORELAI,But ,2
LUKE,"If you don't like it, you can just deal with it.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, I'll just deal with it.",2
LUKE,Good.,2
LORELAI,,2
LUKE,"And by the way, I wasn't asking her out. I was giving her directions for the quickest way back to Hartford. It was very romantic. I said you take a right at Deerfield, and you catch the I-5 and you take it south. Oh man, hot stuff.",2
LORELAI,That is so typical of you.,2
LUKE,What?,2
LORELAI,,2
GIRLorelai,Do you mind?,2
RORY,"Oh, no.",2

EMILY,How's the meal?,2
RORY,Tasty.,2
LORELAI,Very tasty. New cook?,2
EMILY,"Yes, Marisella. She's introduced us to some wonderful dishes so charmingly specific to her native country.",2
LORELAI,What country is she from?,2
EMILY,One of those little ones next to Mexico.,2
LORELAI,How charmingly specific.,2
RORY,Too bad Grandpa's not here. He likes weird food.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, where's he eating his weird food tonight? Argentina? Morocco?",2
EMILY,Akron.,2
RORY,Ohio?,2
EMILY,Yes.,2
LORELAI,Get out of here.,2
EMILY,I will not get out of here.,2
LORELAI,"No Mom, I didn't mean really get out of here, I mean ",2
RORY,Why is Grandpa in Akron?,2
EMILY,I don't know.,2
Posted,12/02/01 02:00,2
LORELAI,It was just a saying.,2
EMILY,They sent him to deal with some problem with their local office down there.,2
LORELAI,"A saying, you know, like 'save me' or 'get me out of here'. Things like that.",2
EMILY,"Lorelai, would you like me to put a mirror in front of you so you can look at yourself while you have this conversation?",2
LORELAI,"Sorry, Dad's in Akron.",2
EMILY,Yes. The amenities are atrociously lacking. He had to eat at a coffee shop last night. The whole thing's terribly insulting. He's miserable.,2
RORY,I hate that he's miserable.,2
EMILY,So do I. We really ought to do something.,2
RORY,"Yes, I agree.",2
LORELAI,"Warning, warning.",2
EMILY,"I'm glad to hear you say that Rory, because I thought of a wonderful way to cheer him up.",2
RORY,"Cool, what?",2
LORELAI,"Danger, Will Robinson, danger!",2
EMILY,An oil portrait of you for his study.,2
RORY,An oil portrait.,2
LORELAI,"I tried, have fun.",2
EMILY,It could hang right over his mantle. He'd just love it.,2
RORY,"Well, I guess that would be okay.",2
LORELAI,"Oh Mom, please, don't make her do this.",2
EMILY,She just said she would.,2
LORELAI,"Fine, paint the picture, but don't make her sit and pose for it. Paint it from a photo.",2
EMILY,A photo? That's what they do at malls.,2
RORY,"I'll sit, it's fine.",2
EMILY,Just because your own experience sitting for a portrait was bad doesn't mean Rory's has to be.,2
RORY,What portrait? I haven't seen this.,2
LORELAI,They never finished.,2
EMILY,"Three painters started, and they all three quit.",2
RORY,Why did they quit?,2
EMILY,She wouldn't stop scowling.,2
LORELAI,I was going for a Billy Idol thing.,2
EMILY,The one from Italy had some sort of breakdown.,2
RORY,Oh my God.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, it didn't hurt Van Gogh, the guy should thank me.",2
EMILY,"A year later, I swear I saw him rummaging through our recyclables.",2
RORY,"Well, I'm happy to sit. If it's for Grandpa, why not?",2
EMILY,Wonderful. I'll set it up first thing in the morning.,2
LORELAI,,2
LUKE,"So, the first thing you and Sookie would do is incorporate.",2
LORELAI,Wow. Sounds so big time.,2
LUKE,"Not really. It just means you're a single business entity. You'll both be officers and shareholders, and you'll get to make up a name for your company and everything.",2
LORELAI,"Mmm, I'm terrible at coming up with names. When we first bought out house, Rory and I wanted to name it , you know, like Jefferson named his place Monticello, but all we could come up with is The Crap Shack.",2
LUKE,Nice.,2
JESS,Coffee?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, thanks. How are you Jess?",2
JESS,"Well, I'm not bleeding or anything.",2
LORELAI,"Well, then it's gonna be a good day, huh?",2
JESS,Yeah. It's 7:45.,2
LUKE,So?,2
JESS,So do you want me to go to school or do you want to openly defy child labor laws?,2
LUKE,Go. Stay out of trouble.,2
JESS,Guess that means calling off the chickie run down at the salt flax.,2
LUKE,Out.,2
LORELAI,"Wow, so much love.",2
LUKE,"So, you guys have a site in mind for the inn?",2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
LUKE,"Great, where?",2
LORELAI,You've seen pictures of it. The Rachel property.,2
LUKE,"Oh, right.",2
LORELAI,Sorry.,2
LUKE,It's okay.,2
LORELAI,"I just meant, Rachel took the pictures, and the pictures kind of got us into the place, so we started calling it the Rachel property 'cause it made sense at the time and then it became a habit. But now out of respect for you, I'm gonna stop repeatedly using her name and uh, think of another name to call it. Let's see, The Crap Shack's taken.",2
LUKE,It's okay. Call it what you want.,2
LORELAI,"So, who taught you about all this business stuff? Your dad?",2
LUKE,"Please. My dad didn't even have a checking account until I finally got taller then he was. He bought this land with cash from working construction, built this place himself. Didn't have a bookkeeper, an accountant, or anything.",2
LORELAI,"Wow, so you had no one showing you the ropes.",2
LUKE,"Nope, I figured I had to just dive in on my own, fail if that's my destiny, and forget what the experts say.",2
LORELAI,"That is exactly my philosophy. Exactly. Except I'm not diving in on my own, I'm diving in with Sookie, and, uh, failure is not even a choice of destinies, and I'm consulting any expert who will listen to me. Otherwise, it's identical.",2
LUKE,"Well, I should be getting going. You gonna write this meal off?",2
LORELAI,Why?,2
LUKE,"Oh, we talked business. You gotta be thinking about these things.",2
LORELAI,"No, I mean, why? I'm not paying for it. Exactly.",2
LUKE,,2
LORELAI,It shouldn't be too flashy.,2
SOOKIE,"How about something historical, like 'The Paul Revere'?",2
LORELAI,"Oh, that could work.",2
MICHELorelai,What could work?,2
LORELAI,We're thinking up names for the inn we're gonna open.,2
SOOKIE,"I mean, if you want simple, something like 'The Country Rose'.",2
LORELAI,That's pretty good.,2
SOOKIE,We could line the front path with multicolored roses.,2
LORELAI,Or. . or 'The Inn by the Hollow'. Kind of long.,2
SOOKIE,"No, but nice.",2
MICHELorelai,How about 'The Money Pit'?,2
LORELAI,Boo.,2
MICHELorelai,Or 'The Outhouse'. Go international.,2
SOOKIE,Go back in your hole.,2
MICHELorelai,"Or 'The Inn Heading for Bankruptcy'. Kind of long, but nice.",2
SOOKIE,You who have no dreams rain on those who do.,2
MICHELorelai,I say this because I care about you. It's risky what you are doing. Most new businesses go down within two years.,2
LORELAI,"I say if we go down after two years, it'll be the most exciting two years of our lives.",2
SOOKIE,Same here. Boredom stinks.,2
MICHELorelai,"Fine, proceed blindly. Here, it came in ten minutes ago. It does not involve the Independence Inn, therefore delivering it was beyond my official obligations, so I am taking an extra long lunch break.",2
SOOKIE,He's so genuine.,2
LORELAI,Oh my God.,2
SOOKIE,What?,2
LORELAI,It's the title search for the Rachel property. And guess who owns it.,2
SOOKIE,Tell me it 's not that bastard Donald Trump.,2
LORELAI,Fran.,2
SOOKIE,Fran from Weston's Bakery?,2
LORELAI,"Sweet little Fran, the cupcake lady. Not some cigar-chomping, dirty dealing city slicker.",2
SOOKIE,"Ooh! That's good. Hey! 'The Country Slicker.' Funny name, cutesy idea ",2
LORELAI,"Mm, it's a little much.",2
SOOKIE,It's way too much.,2
LORELAI,I'll call Fran.,2
SOOKIE,'Fran's Old Place'! It'll be like Ruth's Chris Steakhouse. People will be trying to figure out who Fran is. Or 'The In Inn'! It's like an inn that's in with the in crowd. . .I'm gonna go sit down.,2
LORELAI,Do that sweetie.,2
SOOKIE,,2
SOOKIE,"Honey, I'm so sorry. Am I late late or just late?",2
LORELAI,Two pieces of carrot cake and a rumball.,2
SOOKIE,"Ah, I am so sorry! I swear I meant to be on time, but I was prepping the raspberry glaze for tonight's dessert special, and it struck me. I made a blueberry glaze for the soufflé I made last Tuesday, and this is Tuesday, and a lot of locals come every week on the same night every week, and I just didn't want to serve them some. . .like a similar dessert even though it's a completely different berry. . .",2
LORELAI,I need another rumball.,2
SOOKIE,"Ah, I'm sorry.",2
LORELAI,"No, you're a perfectionist, and that attention to detail is why people call you the Maestro.",2
SOOKIE,Really? Who calls me that?,2
LORELAI,The people who eat the rumballs.,2
FRAN,"So ladies, how are we doing here?",2
SOOKIE,"Oh, we're doing great Fran.",2
FRAN,"Oh, well that's wonderful.",2
LORELAI,"Fran, could Sookie and I talk to you for a couple minutes?",2
FRAN,"Oh, of course. Marjorie can handle things. Oooh.",2
LORELAI,"Fran, are you okay?",2
FRAN,"Aw, it's this bum hip. It needs to be replaced, again. And I have this awful angina.",2
SOOKIE,"Oh, we're so sorry to hear that.",2
FRAN,"So, I know you didn't come here to listen to me gripe, so tell me what's on your mind.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, well Fran, we understand that you own the old Dragonfly Bed and Breakfast, that whole property out there.",2
FRAN,"Why, yes I do. It was my parents' business.",2
SOOKIE,It's a beautiful place.,2
FRAN,"Oh, it used to be. But it's in such disarray now.",2
LORELAI,"Yes it is, and that's kind of why we're here. We'd actually like to buy it.",2
FRAN,Buy the Dragonfly?,2
LORELAI,"Yes, we'd like to buy it and make it beautiful again, and we're prepared to make you an offer right now.",2
FRAN,"Oh my, well this is a surprise.",2
LORELAI,"See, Sookie and I are gonna start our own inn and we've been searching for the perfect place.",2
FRAN,Your own inn?,2
LORELAI,Yeah.,2
FRAN,Oh how wonderful! You are going to be so successful.,2
SOOKIE,Thanks Sweetie.,2
LORELAI,"That means so much, like we have your blessing.",2
FRAN,But I can't sell you the property.,2
SOOKIE,What?,2
LORELAI,How come?,2
FRAN,"I just couldn't. You know, I have no siblings and no children and in a ways, that place is really the only family I have. I'm the last Weston left, so I plan to own it forever.",2
LORELAI,Forever?,2
FRAN,Forever and ever.,2
LORELAI,That's a very long time.,2
SOOKIE,A very long time.,2
FRAN,I'm so sorry.,2
LORELAI,"Fran, may I ask. . . um. . .",2
FRAN,"Go ahead honey, ask me an ything you want.",2
LORELAI,"Well, what happens to the place if you. . .well, if forever isn't quite forever?",2
FRAN,I don't understand dear. All I know is that I can't sell the place.,2
LORELAI,"Oh no, I don't mean selling it. I mean, you would keep it forever, but what happens once you're no longer in the position of physically controlling the property?",2
FRAN,How could that be?,2
LORELAI,"Uh, well, if you um, if you ",2
SOOKIE,Take a long vacation.,2
LORELAI,"Yes, take a long vacation. Thank you.",2
SOOKIE,You're welcome.,2
LORELAI,"And when you're on that long vacation, the property is just left sitting there. Well, what happens then?",2
FRAN,"Oh, I don't enjoy vacations. I toured the California gold country ten years ago, it was hot and the bus smelled.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, I mean a longer vacation than a trip to California.",2
SOOKIE,To a different place.,2
FRAN,What kind of place?,2
LORELAI,A place out there.,2
SOOKIE,Way out there Fran.,2
FRAN,Europe?,2
LORELAI,I mean the ultimate long vacation.,2
SOOKIE,"Yeah, Francie, eventually, we're all gonna take the same long vacation.",2
LORELAI,"And with that being the case, you might want to sell the property now and enjoy the money.",2
FRAN,"I'm very sorry, but I can never sell the place.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, well thanks for your time Fran.",2
SOOKIE,"Yeah, thanks Fran.",2
FRAN,Bye now.,2
LORELAI,Bye.,2
SOOKIE,Bye.,2
FRAN,You both look so sad. Would you like a cupcake?,2
LORELAI,Please.,2
SOOKIE,Yeah.,2
FRAN,,2
LANE,"So, Janie Fertman's trying to be my friend again.",2
RORY,Yikes. What kind of vibe are you giving her?,2
LANE,"Oh, my patented Keith Richards circa 1969 'don't mess with me' vibe, with a thousand-yard Asian stare thrown in.",2
RORY,That should do it.,2
RORY,,2
POLICEWOMAN,Just try to calm down Taylor.,2
TAYLORory,Calm down! Why should I calm down?,2
BOOTSY,"Yeah, why should he calm down?",2
TAYLORory,I want action not words.,2
BOOTSY,"Yeah, action not words.",2
TAYLORory,"Don't you need to get back to your newsstand, Bootsy?",2
BOOTSY,"No buddy, I'm all yours.",2
POLICEWOMAN,"We're gonna get to the bottom of this, I promise you.",2
TAYLORory,A crime w as commit ted right in front of my store.,2
POLICEWOMAN,"Now, we can't say that for sure yet.",2
TAYLORory,"How come you can't say that for sure? This is a police tape. You're the police, you own the tape!",2
POLICEWOMAN,"Taylor, we've contacted everyone in the precinct. No one knows anything about this.",2
TAYLORory,"Well, what am I supposed to do? I've got a dead body right in front of my store!",2
POLICEWOMAN,"No, you have a chalk outline of a dead body in front of your store.",2
BOOTSY,Meaning that there were two crimes.,2
POLICEWOMAN,What?,2
BOOTSY,"What do you mean what? Somebody got m*rder*d, then somebody stole the body. It's open and shut, bing bang boom.",2
POLICEWOMAN,Is this your son?,2
TAYLORory,I should say not.,2
BOOTSY,Oh.,2
POLICEWOMAN,"Look, my partner's doing a headcount to see if anyone in town is missing. Until then, just hang tight.",2
RORY,Hey.,2
DEAN,Hey.,2
RORY,What's going on?,2
DEAN,"I don't know. I got here and this is what I found. I mean, I told him it looked fake, but he didn't believe me.",2
RORY,And you have such an honest face.,2
DEAN,"Well, he must not love me as much as you do.",2
LANE,"Okay, you two are officially sickening.",2
POLICEWOMAN,Everyone's accounted for Taylor. It looks like this is just an elaborate prank.,2
TAYLORory,But it looks so real. Where'd they get the police tape?,2
POLICEWOMAN,Kids have their ways.,2
TAYLORory,Who'd be depraved enough to pull a stupid prank like this?,2
POLICEWOMAN,,2
RORY,"Mom, you're not writing what you purchased on the back of any of the inn's credit cards receipts.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, well, just put cooking spray and sponges.",2
RORY,Okay. And when an auditor wants to know why you need such large amounts of cooking spray and sponges?,2
LORELAI,Then I drop my pencil and I put the scoop neck sweater that I'm now making a mental note to wear to good use.,2
RORY,Well at least you've got a solid well thought out plan.,2
SOOKIE,I had a dream last night about us and Fran.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, what was it?",2
SOOKIE,"Well, it was in the future and we were all old, you and me and Rory and Jackson and Michel, everyone. Gray hair, walking around with canes, we're all kind of ailing, you know? I had those big cataract glasses on. You were hard of hearing and kept going, Huh? Huh?",2
LORELAI,"Oh, that's attractive.",2
RORY,Its you kids with your rock and roll.,2
SOOKIE,"But wuh-ho, here walks up Fran, and guess what. She looks exactly the same, even better.",2
LORELAI,Ugh! That's not fair.,2
SOOKIE,That woman is gonna live forever.,2
LORELAI,"Not necessarily. Hey, did you look up angina? I forgot to.",2
SOOKIE,"Yeah, it's nothing major.",2
RORY,You guys have got to stop talking like this.,2
LORELAI,Like what?,2
RORY,"We love Fran, rememb er? Fran is great.",2
SOOKIE,"No, honey, of course we love Fran. We just wanna know what God's little plan is for her, that's all.",2
MICHELorelai,"I would advise at least pretending to look busy, the boss is here.",2
RORY,Mia!,2
LORELAI,You're kidding! When?,2
MICHELorelai,I just spotted her walking in.,2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,Mia!,2
MIA,Uh! Oh my babies! Ooh!,2
RORY,Did we know you were coming?,2
MIA,I didn't know I was coming.,2
LORELAI,This isn't a surprise inspection is it?,2
MIA,"That's exactly what this is. Ready? Oh, you're too thin as always.",2
RORY,But we eat.,2
MIA,And you're both too beautiful.,2
LORELAI,"Yes, that's true. We often feel guilty monopolizing the amount of beauty we're in possession of.",2
MIA,"And I don't see you enough which is my fault, so you both pass.",2
LORELAI,Aww.,2
MIA,"Ooh Michel. Ooh, how nice to see you. Uh, and look at that suit. You are quite the dandy, aren't you?",2
MICHELorelai,"Well, I had a feeling that a lovely woman was going to be visiting today so I decided I must look my best for her.",2
MIA,"I'm sorry honey, I didn't catch a word of that.",2
RORY,He said he missed you.,2
MIA,"You've been in the U.S. quite some time Michel, your enunciation really should be better by now.",2
MICHELorelai,The customers seem to understand me just fine.,2
MIA,I didn't get that either. Did you get the tapes I sent you?,2
LORELAI,"Hey, maybe you should hit the desk. A couple of people are looking for help.",2
MICHELorelai,"Right away. Mia, uh, I. . .",2
MIA,"So, are you too busy to sneak out with me for a walk?",2
RORY,Not if it's okay with the boss.,2
MIA,It's a demand at this point.,2
LORELAI,"Let's go. Michel, hold down the fort?",2
MICHELorelai,"Oh, it's a little slow now, so it's no problem.",2
RORY,"Oh, he says that he's never liked you and that you're a problem.",2
MICHELorelai,I said no such thing!,2
MIA,I don't know where this hostility comes from. Can we work this out?,2
MICHELorelai,There's nothing to work out.,2
RORY,He told you to get out.,2
MICHELorelai,I did not!,2
MIA,,2
MIA,"Look at this place, it's exactly the same.",2
LORELAI,"Actually, I made him paint it a few months ago.",2
MIA,"Well, good for you.",2
LUKE,Mia hey!,2
MIA,Nice to see you Lucas.,2
LUKE,"You're the only person in the world who can call me that, Mia.",2
MIA,I know this.,2
LUKE,I'm saying it for others who plan to try it later.,2
LORELAI,Whatever Lucas.,2
LUKE,"Mia, you know anything about toasters?",2
MIA,Not a damn thing.,2
LUKE,"Well, then sit down and let me get you some coffee.",2
LORELAI,"So, Mia, how's living in Santa Barbara?",2
MIA,Horrible. Did you know the damn sun shines all the time out there?,2
RORY,They've written songs about that.,2
MIA,"Well, no one told me that's how it was. Half of my wardrobe is obsolete.",2
LORELAI,"Aw, drag. Hey, you know that vintagey blue coat?",2
MIA,You're not getting it.,2
LORELAI,Right.,2
JESS,You're making that worse.,2
LUKE,"Big help, thanks.",2
LORELAI,Luke's nephew.,2
MIA,"Luke, that's your nephew?",2
LUKE,"It's Liz's kid. Jess, this is Mia, she owns the Independence Inn.",2
JESS,Huh.,2
LUKE,"That's 'Hello, nice to meet you' in slacker.",2
JESS,"You don't need me down here, do you?",2
LUKE,I'm sorry Mia. He's just ,2
MIA,"Oh please, forget it. You weren't exactly a talkative boy yourself when you were his age.",2
LORELAI,"That's right, you knew Luke as a boy.",2
RORY,I can't imagine Luke as a boy.,2
LUKE,Can we change the subject?,2
MIA,He would help people carry groceries home.,2
RORY,"Oh, how very Boy Scout-y of you.",2
MIA,For a quarter a bag.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, how very John Birch Society-y of you.",2
MIA,He was never without his skateboard for a time.,2
LORELAI,Were you any good?,2
LUKE,I could hold my own.,2
MIA,And there was that year you wore the same shirt everywhere you went.,2
LUKE,I don't rememb er that.,2
LORELAI,Must have been something flannel.,2
MIA,"No, it was from that TV show. That famous one.",2
LUKE,It's not important.,2
MIA,"Star Trek, that's it!",2
LORELAI,"Oh my God, oh my God!",2
LUKE,Stop it.,2
RORY,You were a Trekkie?,2
LUKE,I was not a Trekkie.,2
LORELAI,"Uh uh, I do believe that denying you were a Trekkie is a violation of the prime directive.",2
RORY,Indubitably captain.,2
LUKE,"It was a gift from my aunt, I wore it to make her happy.",2
LORELAI,I've never wanted to make any aunt of mine that happy.,2
MIA,Did I say something I shouldn't have?,2
LORELAI,"Oh no Mia, that's okay. I just have to cancel everything I have scheduled for the next three months 'cause I'll still be laughing my ass off.",2
TAYLORory,"Luke, I need to talk to you right now.",2
LUKE,What is it Taylor?,2
TAYLORory,I have conducted a thorough investigation of all the people who may have inadvertently been witness to the phony m*rder at my store last night.,2
MIA,There was a phony m*rder?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, the town's too dull to work up a real m*rder.",2
RORY,But you're one 'beam me u p Scotty' reference away from being the victim of one.,2
LORELAI,Mm.,2
TAYLORory,"Luke, are you going to listen?",2
LUKE,What's this got to do with me?,2
TAYLORory,"Three people have reported seeing Jess in that area late last night, skulking, lurking.",2
LUKE,There were a lot of people out late last night. I know because I fed some of them. I'll give you their names so you can add them to your suspect list.,2
TAYLORory,Another person witnessed Jess walking out of an arts and crafts store two days ago with what appeared to be chalk.,2
LUKE,You appear to be bugging me Taylor.,2
TAYLORory,What are you gonna do about it Luke?,2
LUKE,About what?,2
TAYLORory,About the results of my investigation.,2
LUKE,"Absolutely nothing, but thanks for the info.",2
TAYLORory,You have to do something. People want action.,2
LUKE,"People, meaning you.",2
TAYLORory,"Not just me. I speak for the Stars Hollow Business Association, the Stars Hollow Tourist Board, the Stars Hollow Neighborhood Watch Organization, and the Stars Hollow Citizens for a Clean Stars Hollow Council.",2
LUKE,All of which are you.,2
TAYLORory,So are you going to act.,2
LUKE,Yes I am. I'm gonna act like you never came in here.,2
TAYLORory,"Fine, have it your own way. But I warn you, there's gonna be a lot of unhappy people at S.H.B.A., the S.H.T.B., the S.H.N.W.O. and the S.H.C.C.S.H.C.",2
LUKE,F-I-N-E.,2
TAYLORory,"Oh, you're. . .you're impossible, you are impossible! Oh, hi Mia.",2
MIA,"Nice to see you Taylor. Ah, I gotta get out of Santa Barbara. I miss the small town theater. And I miss you. Hey, do you realize it was fifteen years ago almost to the day?",2
LORELAI,Yes it was.,2
RORY,What was?,2
MIA,To the day when this skinny little teenage girl showed up at the inn. She had this tiny little thing in her arms.,2
LORELAI,A little thing named Rory.,2
RORY,"Okay, no physical reenactments.",2
MIA,"You marched up to me, looked me right in the eye and said, 'I'm here for a job. Any job.'",2
LORELAI,"Well, IBM had turned me down for the CEO slot, so I was desperate.",2
MIA,"Work experience none, recommen dations none, skills ",2
LORELAI,"Besides flawlessly applying mascara in a moving car, none.",2
MIA,"Not one thing to recommen d hiring her. Just that how do I put it and remain a lady that 'who cares' look in her eyes, so I gave her any job. The other maids hated you.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, well they were all so slow.",2
MIA,You were special.,2
RORY,"Mia, why don't you move back here? We miss you.",2
LORELAI,Or at least visit more? You used to check in. You never come at all.,2
MIA,I don't have to. You've made me redundant.,2
LORELAI,I have not.,2
MIA,"Don't be humble. The inn is beyond covered. It's never run this well or been this successful. That inn is like your place now. Without you I wouldn't know what to do, I'd be lost.",2
LORELAI,"Lost, yeah.",2
RORY,Yeah.,2
MIA,"You look sad now, why?",2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,"In all the excitement, I hadn't thought about telling Mia. What is wrong with me?",2
SOOKIE,Nothing is wrong with you.,2
LORELAI,I feel terrible. I should've told her before. I should've told her the day the idea occurred to us. She deserved that. After all she's done for me. Hello?,2
EMILY,"Lorelai, your daughter's being impossible. She won't pose in an appropriate manner.",2
RORY,I'm trying to Grandma. It's just awkward.,2
LORELAI,Let me guess how you're posing her. She's in a silly gown on a silly chair with both of her hands raised in some silly way.,2
EMILY,"No, just the one hand is raised, and none of it's silly.",2
LORELAI,"Pick a simpler pose, Mom.",2
EMILY,"This is the simplest, and it wasn't my choice.",2
LORELAI,And your choice is ,2
EMILY,I wanted the swan to sit regally aside Rory's throne.,2
LORELAI,Swan? Throne?,2
EMILY,"Oh, now you have a problem with swans and thrones.",2
LORELAI,"Because swans and thrones scream one thing Mom, Siegfried and Roy.",2
EMILY,Who?,2
LORELAI,Make a change Mom.,2
EMILY,I suppose you'd just have her sitting in a chair reading a book.,2
LORELAI,Now that sounds great.,2
EMILY,"Oh, be serious.",2
LORELAI,I am. That's a completely natural pose for Rory. And a painting of her reading that's gonna be hung in Dad's study seems just crazy enough to work.,2
EMILY,"Well, maybe it's not such a bad idea.",2
LORELAI,Give it a try. And let her lower her arm.,2
EMILY,"Rory, you can lower your arm.",2
RORY,Thanks.,2
EMILY,I think he's just hungry. We're going to lose the swan.,2
LORELAI,Good going Mom. Bye. Ugh. So how do I do this? How..how how do I tell Mia that I'm leaving?,2
SOOKIE,Get her drunk first?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, I can't believe it. I'm gonna let down the one person in my life who was there for me when I needed it the most. I'm great, aren't I?",2
MIA,I wanted to put it on the front desk but I think it might be a tad short.,2
MICHELorelai,"Well, we could get a carpenter to build up a base and raise it up two inches and then it would be perfect.",2
MIA,"Great idea. Hey, I got that, every word!",2
MICHELorelai,Yes!,2
MIA,"Oh, oh, I'm so proud!",2
SOOKIE,So you gonna tell her now or later?,2
LORELAI,"Later, because she's so happy that she can finally understand Michel and that the lamp is fixed and that...",2
SOOKIE,,2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,We're late.,2
LORELAI,We're not late.,2
RORY,"The last time w e were late, Taylor said that there would be consequences.",2
LORELAI,He did not. He said there would be severe consequences.,2
RORY,"Mia, what time is it? Are we late?",2
MIA,I hope so.,2
LORELAI,Mia!,2
MIA,"I'm sorry, but it's been two years since I've gotten to go to a town meeting and I want some controversy.",2
LORELAI,Aha!,2
LUKE,Geez! Don't sneak up on me like that.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, boy, I was lucky you had your phasers on stun, huh?",2
RORY,"Well, at least we're not late. Luke's never late.",2
LUKE,"Actually, we're 2 minutes early.",2
RORY,Ha! We should get a prize for being on time.,2
LORELAI,"Hey Luke, let's go back to the diner and get some pie as our reward for being on time.",2
LUKE,Then you'd be late.,2
LORELAI,"A funny conundrum, but I want pie.",2
LUKE,You're harassing me now.,2
LORELAI,"I'm not harassing you. We're your groupies. Oh Luke, you're so dreamy, be my guy!",2
RORY,"No, be my guy!",2
LUKE,I'm bringing up the need for more police protection at this thing.,2
MIA,I think we're late.,2
LUKE,What's going on here?,2
TAYLORory,"Uh, nothing.",2
LUKE,"Meeting was supposed to start at eight Taylor, it's a minute to eight.",2
TAYLORory,,2
PATTY,"Oh, you might as well be honest with him Taylor.",2
LORELAI,Be honest with him about what?,2
TAYLORory,"Well, if you must know, there was a special issue that the business community had to deal with first, so we decided to start early tonight.",2
LUKE,I'm in the business community and I wasn't told about it. Taylor?,2
TAYLORory,"All right, fine. You weren't invited Luke.",2
LUKE,And why is that?,2
MIA,Controversy.,2
TAYLORory,You weren't invited because we are dealing with the Jess situation.,2
LUKE,The Jess situation?,2
LORELAI,"Uh oh. If this was the wild west, we'd be pushing the horse aside and diving into the water trough right about now.",2
LUKE,,2
PATTY,"Luke, honey, calm down.",2
TAYLORory,"After all, this is all your doing. If you hadn't so cavalierly dismissed the issue, we wouldn't have had to do this. I lost business because of what your hooligan nephew did.",2
LUKE,"How was business lost Taylor? If you had to open a little late that day, your customers just came back later.",2
TAYLORory,"Not so. When Mrs. Lanahan couldn't buy her head of lettuce that morning for her lunch,she drove straight to Woodbury to buy lettuce from a competing market. Isn't that right Mrs. Lanahan? Mrs. Lanahan?",2
LORELAI,You really shouldn't be driving anymore.,2
TAYLORory,Word has it that she was telling other Doose market shoppers that Woodbury lettuce is crisper. That's business flying out the door.,2
LUKE,"Okay fine. How much is a head of lettuce, a buck? Oh, let's go crazy, give me five heads.",2
TAYLORory,"This goes well beyond a head of lettuce, young man. The charges against your nephew are numerous. He stole the 'save the bridge' money...",2
LUKE,He gave that back.,2
TAYLORory,He stole a gnome from Bab ette's garden.,2
LUKE,,2
PATTY,He hooted one of my dance classes.,2
FRAN,He took a garden hose from my yard.,2
MAN,My son said he set off the fire alarms at school last week.,2
LORELAI,I heard he controls the weather and wrote the screenplay to Glitter.,2
BOOTSY,I think it's time for me to pipe up here.,2
LUKE,"Oh yeah, that'll be good.",2
BOOTSY,I have every right to pipe in here Luke. I'm a local entrepreneur.,2
LUKE,"You took over your father's newsstand Bootsy, it doesn't make you an entrepreneur.",2
BOOTSY,And you took over your old man's hardware store.,2
LUKE,And turned it into a diner.,2
BOOTSY,Big whoop. Who can't fry an egg?,2
TAYLORory,"Let's keep it moving here boys, huh?",2
BOOTSY,I never liked the look of that kid from the second I saw him.,2
LUKE,Unbelievable.,2
BOOTSY,"Excuse me, but I've got the floor.",2
LUKE,You don't have the floor.,2
BOOTSY,"I'm standing, aren't I?",2
LUKE,Well I was standing first which means I have the floor and I'm not giving it to you.,2
TAYLORory,What is with you too?,2
BOOTSY,This goes way beyond the Jess matter Taylor. Luke's been on my case since the first grade when he wrongfully accused me of sabotaging a clay imprint that he made of his hand.,2
LORELAI,"Ooh! Think hard, was he dressed like Sulu?",2
LUKE,No one cares about the stupid clay hand Bootsy. And you stomped on it while it was drying. Three kids saw you.,2
BOOTSY,No I didn't.,2
LUKE,You did too!,2
BOOTSY,No I didn't.,2
TAYLORory,"Boys, please. The bottom line here is that there is a consensus among townspeople who are in agreement that Stars Hollow was a better place before Jess got here.",2
LUKE,"So this half of the room gets the tar, and the other half gets the feathers?",2
TAYLORory,"Well, there hasn't been any talk of tar and feathers. Although ",2
LUKE,"Look, I've lived in this town my entire life, longer than most everybody here.",2
BOOTSY,"I beg to differ. I'm five weeks older than you, that means I've been here five weeks longer.",2
LUKE,"I've never bothered anyone. I've kept to myself and I've done the best I could. I pay my taxes, and I help people when I can. I haven't pitched in on the decorative pageantry town stuff because it all seems insane to me, but I don't get in the way of that stuff either.",2
TAYLORory,"What's your point, Luke?",2
LORELAI,His point is do you mind?,2
LUKE,Be my guest.,2
LORELAI,"His point is, that if there's a problem ",2
LUKE,And I'm not saying there's a problem.,2
LORELAI,"Right, he's not saying there is a problem, but if there it, give him time to deal with it before you storm his diner with torches and pitchforks.",2
LUKE,"Right. What I'm dealing with, being a problem, that I don't necessarily agree that I even have.",2
LORELAI,Right.,2
TAYLORory,I didn't get that last part.,2
LORELAI,Lay off him because what you're all doing stinks.,2
LUKE,"I'm done here. I'm done with all of you. Oh, and I was gonna stay open later in case anyone wanted to eat after the meet ing. Forget that.",2
BOOTSY,,2
MIA,"Well, I must say that was quite exciting.",2
LORELAI,A little disturbing. I think the whole town needs a field trip.,2
RORY,Do you think Luke's okay?,2
LORELAI,I think he will be. He just needs to cool off a little.,2
RORY,"Hey, I'm gonna go check on Dean. He's been scraping that outline off the cement for two days now.",2
LORELAI,Good idea. There's nothing like your face on his to make the cleaning process go faster.,2
RORY,She's all yours Mia.,2
MIA,I'll take her.,2
LORELAI,Bye hon.,2
MIA,"Oh, I am just having the most wonderful time. And I am so proud of you and Rory. You both have just come so far.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, we have. Um, Mia, I need to talk to you about something.",2
MIA,"Of course. What is it, honey?",2
LORELAI,"Well, um, it's really hard, and uh, I should've brought it up ages ago, but Sookie and I are thinking of making a change.",2
MIA,A change?,2
LORELAI,We're going to open our own inn.,2
MIA,Oh!,2
LORELAI,"I mean, we've talked about it for a long time and it seems like the time is right and Oh Mia, I love the Independence Inn and Sookie loves it too and we both love you so much.",2
MIA,I know.,2
LORELAI,But it just feels like something we need to do and you hate me.,2
MIA,No I don't.,2
LORELAI,I'm letting you down. I'm walking out. I'm being ungrateful.,2
MIA,"Lorelai, stop. Do you think I was naïve enough to think that you'd work for me forever? You and Sookie have more talent for this business than I do. And I'm very good. You're going to open an incredible place, and if you don't let me help you in any way I can, then I'll be very mad.",2
LORELAI,"Of course, we need your help. We'd be lost without your help.",2
MIA,"Good. I was just wondering, what's the time frame for this big move?",2
LORELAI,"Well, we're waiting for this perfect location to free up, that's all that's delaying us. But I promise you'll have plenty of notice and I'll be there to find our replacements and train them.",2
MIA,"Oh yes, that's very sweet of you, but I'm wondering if you could possibly make it sooner rather than later?",2
LORELAI,What?,2
MIA,"Well, you see, your leaving gives me the perfect excuse to finally sell the place.",2
LORELAI,Sell the place?,2
MIA,"Oh, I get offers all the time, lucrative ones, but I never even considered it because. . . oh, of course I love the inn, but I just couldn't do that to you. And now that you have this big change coming up in your life, it might be time for one in mine.",2
LORELAI,"Oh. Good, uh, good. Then it all works out good.",2
MIA,"Actually, it's very good!",2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,Hey.,2
SOOKIE,Hey. So I'm working on the menu for the Duncan wedding.,2
LORELAI,I can't read that.,2
SOOKIE,"I know. I had it all typed up nice and neat to begin with but on the drive into work, I got an inspiration. I just started crossing it out and writing in the new stuff. And it ain't easy writing and driving, and I can't read that. What is that - cumin?",2
LORELAI,"Sookie, I can't read that either.",2
SOOKIE,"Oh. I'll just get you a new one. Hey, how did your talk with Mia go?",2
LORELAI,Fine. Good. She took it like you said she would - classy.,2
SOOKIE,"She is classy. Good, good. That's a relief. It is a relief right? I mean, you said she took it good?",2
LORELAI,Yes she did.,2
SOOKIE,But you look upset.,2
LORELAI,She's gonna sell the inn.,2
SOOKIE,You're kidding.,2
LORELAI,"No, she said she gets offers and she thinks this might be kind of fortuitous timing for her.",2
SOOKIE,"Well, great, so everybody wins, that's good. Look happy. Okay, this does not look happy.",2
LORELAI,I just don't understand how she can do this.,2
SOOKIE,What's the big deal?,2
LORELAI,"The big deal is she's not gonna sell it to another Mia. It's gonna be a big chain, and they'll come mar ching in with their business models and their corporate approved architects and designers, and change everything around and remodel, and the place will lose all its personality and charm.",2
SOOKIE,"Well, I hope they don't do that, but hey, our place is gonna be full of charm.",2
LORELAI,So you don't care what happens to this place?,2
SOOKIE,"Of course I do, but it's not up to me. I mean, I can't control that. The only thing we can control is what our inn's gonna be like.",2
LORELAI,I guess.,2
SOOKIE,You guess what?,2
LORELAI,We'll see.,2
SOOKIE,We'll see what?,2
LORELAI,"It's just a little short sided to just write off this place when we haven't even bought Fran's yet and, hey, we don't know if we will.",2
SOOKIE,We don't? Why wouldn't we? Lorelai. Is this about Fran's life expectancy because I ,2
LORELAI,"No Sookie, it's about the fact that we haven't even looked at any other places and we don't know if that's necessarily the right one and we have to be very practical about this.",2
SOOKIE,But it's the perfect location. We all said so.,2
LORELAI,"Well, you can't get emotionally attached to any of our decisions about the inn. This is business. You've got to stay detached.",2
SOOKIE,"But we are all so not detached. But okay, do you have another location in mind?",2
LORELAI,Not really.,2
SOOKIE,Do you wanna look for a new location?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, like I have all this time to go looking for other locations.",2
SOOKIE,"Well, I don't know. Should we try to buy this place?",2
LORELAI,Aha. This place is five times what we can afford.,2
SOOKIE,So what do we do?,2
LORELAI,"I don't know. It's on hold, I guess.",2
SOOKIE,"Well, it's been on hold for years. We were moving forward.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, well, I'm looking at the economy right now and I'm thinking, I don't know if the timing's good.",2
SOOKIE,"Okay, that's not fair because I don't know anything about the economy.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, well then good thing you hooked up with me because it's not looking good.",2
SOOKIE,"Okay, what happened?",2
LORELAI,"What do you mean, what happened?",2
SOOKIE,"We had a vision, we had a plan. You're the one that got this whole ball rolling again, and I jumped on the ball, and then we were rolling on the ball together and then you hopped off the ball, and I'm still on the ball. And I'm confused, 'cause I see it, and I see our vision, and you saw it too up until today!",2
LORELAI,"Well, I know you would like things to be simple and straightforward but unfortunately things are more complicated.",2
SOOKIE,"Okay, that's why we'd be partners. If something gets too heavy for the one person, the other one's there to pick up the slack.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, well that's great in theory, but I gotta tell you, my back is aching from all the extra slack I'm taking up!",2
SOOKIE,What did I do that's so wrong?,2
LORELAI,Let's not get into this stuff.,2
SOOKIE,"No, get into it.",2
LORELAI,"Well, you're not the most reliable person in the world or the most punctual.",2
SOOKIE,You've always known that about me.,2
LORELAI,"Yes, but now, getting into business, it's not so cute. It could hurt us. I mean, you were late for the Fran meet ing, you're constantly changing every menu you ever set, even after you've started making it.",2
SOOKIE,I don't believe this! Before it was kudos to me for my attention to detail. I was the maestro.,2
LORELAI,"That's fine for an established place like the Independence, but you do that stuff at our place, it could wipe us out. Profit margins in a new business are slim, Sookie.",2
SOOKIE,Just stop. Just stop. Now you're talking down to me.,2
LORELAI,"I'm not talking down to you, I'm trying to explain.",2
SOOKIE,,2
DEAN,"Hey, I gotta drop by the market.",2
RORY,But it's your day off.,2
DEAN,"Yeah, it's to get my paycheck. If I don't get it by four, Taylor locks it in a safe and it's on some kind of timer and then when I complain, he lectures me about promptly putting checks in the back and the theories of compound interest, and then my head hurts from all the nodding I do even though I don't listen ",2
RORY,"Go, go!",2
DEAN,I'll just be a minute.,2
JESS,Should you be standing here all alone? I hear this is a pretty dangerous corner.,2
RORY,I'm fine.,2
JESS,Feeling succinct today?,2
RORY,Pretty much.,2
JESS,Hmm. Did I do something to offend?,2
RORY,Me?,2
JESS,Yeah.,2
RORY,No.,2
JESS,Good.,2
RORY,You might want to ask that same question to Luke though.,2
JESS,Meaning?,2
RORY,You've got this whole town down on him.,2
JESS,Really? How did I do that?,2
RORY,You know how you did that.,2
JESS,"I'm not really familiar with the blue book laws in this town, so you can be talking about a lot of things. Dropping a gum wrapper, strolling arm in arm with a member of the opposite sex on a Sunday. Ah. What about it?",2
RORY,You did it. The whole town knows you did it. They had a meeting about it.,2
JESS,You actually went to that bizarro town meeting? Those things are so 'To k*ll a Mockingbird.',2
RORY,"Yes, I went. And Luke went. And when he got there, everyone ganged up on him. They all want you gone.",2
JESS,"Wow, bummer .",2
RORY,And he's standing there yelling at everyone and defending you and paying Taylor back for his lettuce losses ,2
JESS,"Wait, his what?",2
RORY,"And now Luke's a pariah and it's all because of you! What a shock, you don't care about any of this.",2
JESS,I didn't say that.,2
RORY,Go. I'm tired of talking to you.,2
JESS,Fine.,2
RORY,You care nothing about Luke and his feelings!,2
JESS,"Got a second wind, huh?",2
RORY,"All he does is stick up for you and all you do is make his life harder. I guess that's what you have to do when you're trying to be Holden Caulfield but I think it stinks. Luke has done a lot for my mom and a lot for me, and I don't like to see him att*cked. Okay, second wind over.",2
JESS,I didn't know they were coming down so hard on him.,2
RORY,"Funny, I never pegged you as clueless, my mistake.",2
JESS,"Okay. I get it. No, no, I do, I get it. So did you at least think it was funny?",2
RORY,That is so not the point.,2
JESS,"Ah, you thought it was funny.",2
DEAN,"I got it. Oh, uh, hey.",2
RORY,"Um Dean, I don't think you two have met. This is Jess. This is Dean.",2
JESS,Boyfriend?,2
RORY,Of course.,2
JESS,"Sorry, you didn't say. How ya doing?",2
DEAN,"Good, good.",2
RORY,"Okay, see you around.",2
JESS,,2
RORY,I wonder if Grandpa's still in Akron?,2
LORELAI,"Well for Akron's sake, I hope he's moved on to Boise. Hi. We're the daughter and the granddaughter.",2
RORY,You are majorly crabby.,2
LORELAI,I just have a headache.,2
EMILY,,2
EMILY,Tada.,2
RORY,Whoa.,2
EMILY,What do you think?,2
RORY,It's freaky.,2
EMILY,Freaky?,2
RORY,"Well, just seeing me here, up on the wall like that, it's uh. . . I like it though. It's good, I guess. I should probably take myself out of the judging process.",2
EMILY,"I think Richard's just gonna love it. It's the perfect thing, don't you think?",2
LORELAI,Mm hmm.,2
EMILY,"You've got to admit, it turned out better than you thought it would.",2
LORELAI,Yeah.,2
EMILY,"Well, come on, say a little more than that.",2
LORELAI,"It's great Mom, it's fabulous. It's just a notch below Rembrandt.",2
EMILY,"Well, you don't have to take that attitude.",2
LORELAI,"What do you want from me? I'd light some sparklers and jump up and down yelling 'Yay for the painting' but I'm fresh out of sparklers and my feet hurt too much to jump. But I promise next week when I have more energy, I'll write a love song for the chandelier.",2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,"Hey, how dare you walk away from me when I'm being a world class jerk to you. The painting's great Mom, really.",2
EMILY,Thank you.,2
LORELAI,"I really like it. It's so natural that she's reading which is great, and she's not sitting next to a goose or a giant tortoise, which is good, and Dad is gonna love it. It's a good thing you did here.",2
EMILY,"You can be so harsh sometimes, and I just don't know where it comes from or what I've done to deserve it.",2
LORELAI,You did nothing.,2
EMILY,"Well, I must've done something.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, I've been...it's just been a bad week. Sookie and I were moving forward with plans to open our inn, and we had huge fight. And we've never had a huge fight, let alone a fight, and awful things were said and it all started when Mia showed up for a visit and I told her about our plans and she's talking about selling the Independence Inn and it just wigged me out a little. It's stupid, I don't know, but that was our home for so long, mine and Rory's. And it's just weird to think that it wouldn't be there and Mia wouldn't be there and I wouldn't be there, and I just got very upset. Anyway, I'm rambling. The painting's really great. Will you accept my apology?",2
EMILY,"Yes, yes I will. I've had bad days too.",2
LORELAI,Thank you.,2
EMILY,,2
LUKE,"Okay, I'm pretty much done.",2
LORELAI,Thanks for doing this. I didn't want the rain to destroy your beautiful chuppah. And I looked and looked in the yellow pages and I didn't see a chuppah waterproofer listing anywhere.,2
LUKE,How about chuppah goat figure repairman?,2
LORELAI,Gilbert.,2
LUKE,What?,2
LORELAI,"The goat. We named him Gilbert, he's headless. Can you fix him?",2
LUKE,"Yeah, I got some glue here. I can fix him.",2
LORELAI,Good. I'll make some tea.,2
LUKE,"So, Sookie stopped at the diner this morning.",2
LORELAI,Oh.,2
LUKE,"I asked her how your plans were going with the new inn, and she very awkwardly changed the subject to women's basketball.",2
LORELAI,Huh.,2
LUKE,She's never shown much interest in sports before.,2
LORELAI,No?,2
LUKE,What's going on with that?,2
LORELAI,"Oh well, you know, women's basketball is getting super popular. That's good, I think. The tall girls need an outlet. We had a fight. A big, humongous fight. She's never going to speak to me again.",2
LUKE,What happened?,2
LORELAI,"I just flat out panicked about the enormity of what we were getting into and it clobbered me, and I clobbered Sookie, and was such a jerk. Hey, if I cry, will it freak you out?",2
LUKE,Totally.,2
LORELAI,What if I whimper?,2
LUKE,How about you suck it up?,2
LORELAI,"Hmm, I'll try.",2
LUKE,I don't get it. You're as ready as you've ever been.,2
LORELAI,"Oh Luke, do not underestimate the complete and total lack of confidence I have in my abilities.",2
LUKE,What? You're the most confident person I know. Obnoxiously so.,2
LORELAI,Thank you.,2
LUKE,I mean in a good way. You're good at what you do and you know it.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, no, no, no. I'm good at doing what I have to do. When I had to get a job, I got it. When I had to find a house for us and a life for us, I got it. When I had to get Rory into Chilton, I did it. But I don't have to leave the Independence Inn. I don't have to go into business for myself, I don't have to walk out on that limb and risk everything I've worked for.",2
LUKE,Then do it.,2
LORELAI,What?,2
LUKE,Just say where you are.,2
LORELAI,"What is this, reverse psychology?",2
LUKE,"No, just stay at the inn. You're happy there.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, so you think I can't hack it.",2
LUKE,Of course you can hack it.,2
LORELAI,"Great, lip service, that's what I need.",2
LUKE,"Hey, if I start to cry, will it freak you out?",2
LORELAI,"Ugh. I couldn't stay where I am if I wanted. Mia is selling the inn. And that hit me hard too, maybe harder than the other thing. I'm gonna be without a home.",2
LUKE,What do you mean? This is your home.,2
LORELAI,"No, I mean a home home. A memory home. The inn is where Rory took her first step. It's where I took my first step. It's more of a home to me more than my parents' house ever was.",2
LUKE,You're just scared. Just like everybody else when they're taking on something big.,2
LORELAI,"Well, then what does everybody else do to get through this feeling?",2
LUKE,"They run in the back, throw up, pass out and then smack their head on the floor.",2
LORELAI,What?,2
LUKE,"That's what I did on the first morning I opened the diner. Look, there is no button to push to get you through this. You just gotta jump in and be scared and stick with it until it gets fun.",2
LORELAI,How long 'til the diner got fun?,2
LUKE,About a year.,2
LORELAI,Wow. And there's no button?,2
LUKE,Nope.,2
LORELAI,"How about a lever, can I pull a lever?",2
LUKE,Nope.,2
LORELAI,Turn a knob?,2
LUKE,Nope.,2
LORELAI,You just jump?,2
LUKE,You just jump.,2
LORELAI,I wanna do it.,2
LUKE,You should do it. Check it out.,2
LORELAI,Gilbert. You're not worse for the wear.,2
LUKE,I'll go reattach him. How'd this happen anyway?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, something must've smacked into him with a hedger.",2
LUKE,"Uh huh, well, no one'll ever know. Oh, and uh, women's basketball is in season. You might wanna run that news past Sookie, and maybe you can go to a game or something.",2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,Hi.,2
SOOKIE,Hi.,2
LORELAI,"Mm. Meat loaf, mashed potatoes, stuffing. Comfort food, huh?",2
SOOKIE,"I thought it would be good with the weather changing like this, but if you don't think it's right I can make something else. Although I'm right on schedule and on budget so a change would kinda throw things off. Your call.",2
LORELAI,"No, no, everything looks great. Hey Sookie.",2
SOOKIE,Yeah?,2
LORELAI,"I'm sorry about what happened. I said stupid things, and I said them for reasons that have nothing to do with you and I hate myself for doing it and I know you do too, and I am sorry.",2
SOOKIE,It's okay.,2
LORELAI,No it isn't. You are a brilliant chef and to think that you should do things differently from how you do them now is ridiculous. You don't tell a great violinist to hold his bow differently. You don't tell a great cymbal player to crash his cymbals differently. You just let them play.,2
SOOKIE,There are great cymbal players?,2
LORELAI,Theoretically.,2
SOOKIE,"Okay, well, it's okay.",2
LORELAI,I wanna go ahead with our plans. Forget my freak out. Pretend it didn't happen. Let's move forward.,2
SOOKIE,Well ,2
LORELAI,You don't want to move forward?,2
SOOKIE,"No, I do. But I need your promise you're not gonna lose it on me again.",2
LORELAI,I promise.,2
SOOKIE,'Cause I couldn't take losing a business partner and my best friend in one fail swoop. It'd betoo much.,2
LORELAI,"Sookie, I will place my hand on whatever you want and swear that you can trust that I will not lose confidence in our dream.",2
SOOKIE,That's good enough 'cause I know you don't like to put your hand on things.,2
LORELAI,We're gonna give it our best shot.,2
SOOKIE,And if we go down after two years ,2

MAN,How about antiques?,2
MIA,"Absolutely, it's the best place for antiques. Michel will have a map for you if you need it.",2
MAN,Thank you.,2
MIA,"Hello, can I help you?",2
EMILY,"No, thank you. I just ",2
MIA,Yes?,2
EMILY,I just wanted to meet the woman who helped raise my daughter.,2
MIA,Emily.,2
EMILY,"Yes, I'm Emily Gilmore.",2
MIA,I've wanted to meet you too for a very long time.,2
EMILY,"Well, that's nice.",2
MIA,"Would you like to sit down? Or have something to eat? Have lunch with me, won't you?",2
EMILY,"No, thank you. You have a lovely place here. It's a beautiful hotel. It's not a home, but still, a beautiful hotel.",2
MIA,Sometimes home is where your hat is.,2
EMILY,Or where your family is.,2
MIA,"Yes, that too. You sure you don't want some tea? Tea usually makes things like this a little less awkward. There's things to hold and stir.",2
EMILY,I don't know why I came here.,2
MIA,You wanted to meet me.,2
EMILY,"After all these years, it makes no sense.",2
MIA,I expected you to come ev entually.,2
EMILY,Did you?,2
MIA,Mm hmm.,2
EMILY,And what did you expect to say to me when I did come?,2
MIA,"When Lorelai showed up on my porch that day with a tiny baby in her arms, I thought to myself, what if this were my daughter, and she was cold and scared and needed a place to live? What would I want for her? And then I thought, I'd want her to find somebody to take her in and make her safe and help her find her way.",2
EMILY,That's funny. I would've wanted her to find someone who would send her home. I have to go. I'd appreciate if you didn't mention this to Lorelai.,2
MIA,I won't.,2
EMILY,"Do you have pictures, from back then?",2
MIA,I'll send you a box full tomorrow.,2
EMILY,,2
LORELAI,"Oh man, it's such a relief to have that Sookie thing fixed.",2
RORY,I know. I hate fighting with friends.,2
LORELAI,That's what enemies are for.,2
RORY,And God knows we have our share of those.,2
LORELAI,People who eat crunchy food with their mouths open.,2
RORY,People who dog ear library books.,2
LORELAI,People who spit when they talk.,2
RORY,"Oh gross, you got me in the eye!",2
LORELAI,I did not.,2
RORY,You totally did!,2
LORELAI,You're full of it.,2
RORY,,2
LUKE,"Ah, it's gonna take awhile. My big toaster's broken so I got stuck with just this dinky one.",2
LUKE,How did that happen?,2
JESS,You're gonna break that.,2
LUKE,It was broken before.,2
JESS,Well it must've got better.,2
LUKE,Inanimate objects don't usually get better. Did you fix this?,2
JESS,Please.,2
LUKE,Jess.,2
JESS,I have no idea what you're babbling about. I don't fix things.,2

LORELAI,I'm back!,2
RORY,Kitchen!,2
LORELAI,"Mmkay, I couldn't make up my mind so I got 'The Shining' and 'Bringing Up Baby.' Now, I know you're thinking, one's a movie about a homicidal parent and the other one's . . . .hello.",2
SOOKIE,Hi.,2
RORY,Hi Mom.,2
LORELAI,What'd you break?,2
SOOKIE,"Nothing. Well, the broiler. But this came for you and Max.",2
RORY,We're thinking it's a wedding present.,2
LORELAI,"Huh. Mmm. Lorelai Gilmore and Max Medina. Well, I guess news doesn't always travel fast.",2
SOOKIE,You gonna open it?,2
LORELAI,No.,2
SOOKIE,But aren't you curious?,2
LORELAI,No. Just leave it there. I'll take it back tomorrow.,2
RORY,But there's not a return address.,2
LORELAI,Well isn't there a card?,2
Posted,12/08/01 23:50,2
RORY,Nope. Maybe there's one inside.,2
SOOKIE,With the return address on it.,2
RORY,But that means you'd have to open it to find out.,2
LORELAI,"Fine, give me a k nife.",2
SOOKIE,Ooh! This is so exciting! Maybe not.,2
RORY,An ice cream mak er!,2
SOOKIE,A Musso Lussino 480!,2
LORELAI,Somebody sent me a f ascist ice cream maker?,2
SOOKIE,"Italian design, stainless steel body, chrome finish.",2
LORELAI,And no card. Perfect.,2
SOOKIE,Jackson just got in his apple crop! We can make cider ice cream!,2
LORELAI,"Yes we can, using his ice cream maker, but Il Duce here is going back.",2
RORY,To where? Maybe it's an orphan.,2
SOOKIE,That's right. We'd be giving it a home.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, once again, I bring up the fact that this is a wedding present, and as I am not getting married, neither God's law nor Emily Post allows me to keep this.",2
RORY,But isn't there a rule about late presents?,2
SOOKIE,"Like if it arrives after a certain date, the giver forfeits all rights of return.",2
RORY,Exactly.,2
LORELAI,Nice try.,2
SOOKIE,"It's true. I saw it on Martha Stewart. She was doing one of those double programs, and the first half was on massaging your dog, and she had this chow and she was rubbing it ",2
LORELAI,Sookie.,2
SOOKIE,"But the second half was about gifts, and she said that if it arrives after ten weeks ",2
RORY,Eight.,2
SOOKIE," eight weeks, that you don't have to return it.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, clearly this is shaping up to be one of those moments that St. Peter's gonna show on the big video screen when I die, and I for one do not wanna see the three of us staggering around with cider ice cream slathered all over our faces while my soul hangs in the balance, so until I canfind out who sent this, no one goes near it. And we're watching 'The Shining.'",2
SOOKIE,,2
TEACHERory,"Believe it or not, Shakespeare probably never intended his plays to be read by students sitting at decks more concerned with getting A's than with the fate of Macbeth. His plays were meant to be experienced, lived. So with that in mind, together with my third period Shakespeare, you'll be split up into five groups and each group will assume responsibility for one act of Romeo and Juliet, which will be performed a week from Sunday. You will nominate the director, you will cast the scene, rehearse the scene, and interpret the scene in your own individual manner. Last year, we did Richard the Third. One group did their scene as the Mafiosi. Another set theirs during the Roman Empire. And my favorite, the climactic last scene was set during the final days of the Sonny and Cher show. Just rememb er, whatever interpretation you choose should highlight the themes you see in the scene. And if the love of the Bard's language still doesn't inspire you, rememb er this will be fifty percent of your final grade.",2

RORY,"Henry, hi.",2
HENRY,"Hey. Act three, sword fight. You?",2
RORY,"Oh, Act five, death scene.",2
HENRY,"Nice. So, uh, tonight, 8 o'clock?",2
RORY,I'll tell Lane.,2
PARIS,"Rory, sorry to interrupt. Hi Henry. But see, we're all standing over there trying to map out a game plan and a rehearsal schedule, and I'm sure whatever the two of you are talking about over here is so much more fascinating and important and, well gosh, let's just say it, fun. But I'd really like to get an 'A' on this assignment, and in order to do that I'm afraid you're gonna have to discuss your sock hops and your clambakes some other time, okay? Thanks.",2
HENRY,That was scary.,2
RORY,It's gonna be a lot scarier when she gets an megaphone in her hands.,2
PARIS,"So, I say we meet in the cafeteria. The acoustics are very similar to the Grand Hall, and. . . oh, well look who showed up.",2
RORY,Sorry.,2
PARIS,Save it.,2
LOUISE,"Well, well, well. Look who's back from suspension.",2
RORY,Tristin got suspended again?,2
PARIS,"Oh, like you hadn't noticed he'd been gone?",2
RORY,What did he do?,2
MADELINE,Took apart Mr. McCaffey's car and put it back together in the science building hallway.,2
RORY,You're kidding.,2
LOUISE,"Yeah, well he didn't do it by himself. Duncan and Bowman were there too.",2
MADELINE,Plus the mechanics that they paid to do the actual work.,2
PARIS,"Hey, anyone stupid enough to hand out with Butch Cassidy and the Sun-dunce kid deserves whatever they get.",2
RORY,How did he fall in with those guys?,2
MADELINE,"The new year started and there they were, all three of them, side by side.",2
LOUISE,And practically dressing the same.,2
MADELINE,,2
LORELAI,"Aunt Bobby, hi. It's Lorelai, Richard and Emily's girl. Um, I'm the one with. . . yeah, that's right. Wow, you don't hear the word wedlock much anymore.",2
RORY,I'm home!,2
LORELAI,"Uh huh, uh huh, really? The Bible said all that, huh? Did it, did it mention me by name? I'm just. . .okay, I'm just kidding. So, um, judging by your Billy Graham impression, I am guessing that you didn't send me an ice cream ma ker, so maybe you could just give me Aunt Clarissa's phone number? Oh no, I hadn't heard. That's terrible. Uh huh. Well, then I guess she had it coming, didn't she? Hey, listen, I'd love to chat about who else is the family is currently or soon to be headed for hell, but I've gotta run, so I promise to call in the next twenty years, okay? Bye bye. How scary is it that my parents are turning our to be the normal ones in the family?",2
RORY,No luck?,2
LORELAI,"Well, I still have the, uh, Pennsylvania Gilmores, but how was your day?",2
RORY,"I have to perform Act Five of Romeo and Juliet with Paris, Madeline, and Louise.",2
LORELAI,Really?,2
RORY,Paris has appointed herself as director.,2
LORELAI,Nice. What part are you playing?,2
RORY,I don't know yet. She's still mulling over the screen tests right now. We're gonna find out tomorrow.,2
LORELAI,Screen tests?,2
RORY,24 takes.,2
LORELAI,"Ah, I so want a copy.",2
RORY,Forget it.,2
LORELAI,"Sell it on the Internet, make a fortune. First we brought you Pamela and Tommy Lee, now prepare yourselves for the crazy antics of Rory and the Bard!",2
RORY,"Oh, and I told Paris that you would make all of our costumes so she wants to have a concept meet ing with you tomorrow at three.",2
LORELAI,What?,2
RORY,"Yeah, she needs a resume an d samples of your previous work and, uh, referrals.",2
LORELAI,And my bare butt to kiss.,2
RORY,"If you think that will set you apart from the other applicants, yes. Hey, I didn't know that there was someone in our family named Bunny.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, cross her off the list.",2

RORY,Don't you think you may be going a little far with this?,2
LORELAI,What do you mean?,2
RORY,"I mean, I understand that you wanna return the ice cream maker, but you did make an honest effort to get in touch with the person that sent this to you, and. . .",2

PAULorelai,"One again, ladies and gentlemen, she takes the last burrito.",2
LORELAI,And hello to you too.,2
PAULorelai,"Week after week, how do you do it?",2
LORELAI,"I told you, correct change. You go in for that dollar bill nonsense, you'll be standing there for ten minutes watching it. Ehhh. Eh eh eh.",2
PAULorelai,And here I thought you had a special relationship with this vending machine.,2
LORELAI,Only in the sense that it keeps me alive.,2
PAULorelai,I actually have theory on that.,2
LORELAI,Uh oh.,2
PAULorelai,"You know, ever since we were children, we got our nourishment from our mothers.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, are you trying to gross me out so I can't eat my burrito?",2
PAULorelai,"And now, we're getting it from ma chines.",2
LORELAI,Your point being?,2
PAULorelai,I think it's a conspiracy getting us ready for the day we're all gonna be raised by machines. No human contact whatsoever.,2
LORELAI,"You know my mother, don't you?",2
PAULorelai,"The, uh, Twilight Zone marathon was on all week.",2
LORELAI,So all of this is a way of saying you wanna look at my notes on the reading.,2
PAULorelai,Such perception.,2
LORELAI,"And in one so young and beautiful. Frightening, isn't it?",2
PAULorelai,"You know, I feel bad about doing this every week.",2
LORELAI,Really? I would've thought you would've gotten used to it by now.,2
PAULorelai,Come on Lorelai. I gotta pay you back somehow. How about you let me take you out to dinner one night?,2
LORELAI,Dinner?,2
PAULorelai,"Yeah, maybe even somewhere that doesn't require correct change, unless you're firmly into the whole coin thing, then I know a good automat.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, I don't know.",2
PAULorelai,"Well, I was kidding about the whole automat.",2
LORELAI,"No, an automat's fine. Um, it's just, uh, my schedule's kinda crazy for the next couple weeks.",2
PAULorelai,"Okay. Well, it's just a thought. But if you suddenly get an opening, give me a call.",2

RORY,"Hi, I'm Rory.",2
BRAD,I'm Brad. From the third period Shakespeare.,2
LOUISE,He's the answer to our lack of boys problem. Isn't that swell?,2
RORY,"Well, maybe we should start.",2
MADELINE,Without Paris?,2
LOUISE,"Ooh, that could be lethal.",2
RORY,We could at least decide on what motif we want to do.,2
PARIS,We're doing traditional Elizabethan.,2
RORY,Elizabethan? But I thought the point of this was to . . .,2
PARIS,"The point is to get an A, not to make Romeo and Juliet into a Vegas lounge act. Besides, we have the death scene. It's classic, it's famous. Who are you?",2
BRAD,"I'm, uh, Brad. From the third period Shakespeare, ma'am.",2
PARIS,"Okay. Now I want everyone to read the chapters on acting I photocopied out of Houseman's Memoirs tonight. Everyone will be off book by Friday, and if you plan on missing rehearsal, you better bring a coroner's note.",2
RORY,Tell me you didn't just have that lying around.,2
PARIS,"We're short on boys. That makes you Romeo. Louise, you can play the Friar.",2
LOUISE,Excuse me?,2
TRISTIN,"Well, well, the g*ng's all here.",2
PARIS,This is a meet ing.,2
TRISTIN,"Yeah, sorry I'm late.",2
PARIS,What do you think you're doing?,2
TRISTIN,"Uh, Professor Anderson forgot to include me when she made up the groups, so she told me to pick one.",2
PARIS,"Fine, you have four other acts to choose from. Take your pick.",2
TRISTIN,"Yeah, well Summer 's in act 1, Beth and Jessica are in act 2, Kate's in act 3, and uh, Claire, Kathy, and Mary are in act 4. So this is the only one free of ex-girlfriends.",2
PARIS,So we're being punished for our good taste?,2
TRISTIN,"Oh, Paris, you hurt me. Do you no longer have any need for me at all?",2
LOUISE,"Yes, we have great need. You can be our Romeo.",2
RORY,Brad is Romeo!,2
LOUISE,Put in your other contact Grandma. Tristin is Romeo. Brad can be the second guard on the left.,2
PARIS,No.,2
MADELINE,"She's kinda right, Paris. Tristin was born to be Romeo.",2
PARIS,"Hey, I'm the director and I'll decide who's born to be what, and Brad is Romeo.",2
LOUISE,Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.,2
PARIS,What'd you say?,2
LOUISE,Just perhaps that someone is letting her personal feeling interfere with her leadership.,2
PARIS,My only feeling is that I don't wanna give the most important part to someone who can't even manage to stay in school.,2
LOUISE,I'm just gonna say one,2
thing,fifty percent of our final grade.,2
TRISTIN,"Is there gonna be any scratching involved, or is this just a verbal thing?",2
PARIS,What do you think about this?,2
RORY,"Well, how are you at speaking in front of a lot of people?",2
BRAD,I tend to throw up.,2
PARIS,"Fine, but I swear, you flake on this and you'll pray you get suspended.",2
TRISTIN,I gotta run. Are we done here?,2
PARIS,"Rehearsal, tomorrow night.",2
LOUISE,Good. So now Brad can be Friar Tuck and I can be Juliet.,2
PARIS,Wrong.,2
LOUISE,Hey.,2
PARIS,Juliet's supposed to be chaste.,2
LOUISE,Oh.,2
MADELINE,Then . . .,2

MICHELorelai,Blueberries. I can only have twelve blueberries for breakfast.,2
SOOKIE,Or what?,2
MICHELorelai,"What do you mean, or what?",2
SOOKIE,What happens if you eat thirteen blueberries?,2
MICHELorelai,Well this is a silly conversation.,2
SOOKIE,Would you die?,2
MICHELorelai,Just hand me the plate.,2
SOOKIE,Only if you don't count.,2
MICHELorelai,I won't count.,2
SOOKIE,"Swear. Raise your right hand and say, 'May Destiny's Child break up if I count these blueberries.'",2

SOOKIE,"Well, honey, that's very thoughtful.",2
LORELAI,Yes it is.,2
SOOKIE,"But we have an ice cream mak er, a professional one. See, that means we can make enough ice cream for everyone in the inn, whereas this little guy ",2
LORELAI,Fernando.,2
SOOKIE,"Fernando, try as he might, can only make enough ice cream for, well, you, so . . .",2
LORELAI,So we don't need him here?,2
SOOKIE,"No, we don't.",2
LORELAI,"Well can't you find some use for him? I mean, he's new and shiny, and it's not his fault that he's part of the other life that I almost had but don't have now, and kinda don't wanna be reminded of.",2
SOOKIE,I guess I could put my change in him.,2
LORELAI,Thank you.,2
SOOKIE,"Honey, can I say something?",2
LORELAI,sh**t.,2
SOOKIE,I'm a little concerned about you.,2
LORELAI,Why?,2
SOOKIE,You just seem very emotional about this ice cream maker.,2
LORELAI,I am not.,2
SOOKIE,You named the ice cream mak er.,2
LORELAI,I name ev erything.,2
SOOKIE,You didn't name the toaster.,2
LORELAI,Poppy.,2
SOOKIE,You just made that up.,2
LORELAI,"I did not. All right, but admit it, Poppy is a damn good name for a toaster.",2
SOOKIE,It's been quite awhile since you and Max have broken up ,2

SOOKIE,"Well, then how many dates have you had post-Max?",2
LORELAI,What does that have to do with anything?,2
SOOKIE,I just feel like you're hibernating.,2
LORELAI,I'm not hibernating.,2
SOOKIE,Yes you are.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, hey, woo. Look at this skirt, huh? I'm not hibernating.",2
SOOKIE,Then how many dates have you been on?,2
LORELAI,"I was engaged Sookie, you don't just get over that.",2
SOOKIE,But you went through your mourning period.,2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
SOOKIE,And you said it was over.,2
LORELAI,It was. . .is.,2
SOOKIE,"Well, are you at least putting the vibe out there so they'll know you're available?",2
LORELAI,"Okay, look, if it'll make you feel any better, okay, I just got asked out the other night.",2
SOOKIE,What? You're kidding! Who is he?,2
LORELAI,Some guy from my business class.,2
SOOKIE,"Oh, business class.",2
LORELAI,"He's a pretty cool guy, actually. He's cute, funny, and, um, he's a little younger, but, uh, he's very sharp. You know, we have this little bit going about me stealing his burrito.",2
SOOKIE,"Oh, stealing his burrito. You kids!",2
LORELAI,"No, like a real burrito.",2
SOOKIE,"Oh, stolen his burrito.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, forget the burrito Sookie.",2
SOOKIE,Fine. When you guys going out?,2
LORELAI,"Well, I didn't exactly say yes.",2
SOOKIE,Why not? You've already got the skirt.,2
LORELAI,"Because, I don't know, what if it doesn't work out? And then class will be weird, and it'll definitely screw up our burrito bit.",2
SOOKIE,"Aw honey, come on, every guy doesn't have to be the guy.",2
LORELAI,I don't know. Isn't it too soon for the transition guy?,2
SOOKIE,Don't think of him as the transition guy. Think of him as the pre-transition guy.,2
LORELAI,A pre-transition guy? You're allowed that?,2
SOOKIE,Absolutely.,2
LORELAI,"Wow, I gotta read the rulebook more carefully.",2
SOOKIE,So?,2

RORY,She's letting you go? That's amazing. What changed her mind?,2
LANE,I let her watch the Romeo and Juliet movie with Leo and Claire Danes.,2
RORY,Really? I would've thought she'd hated it.,2
LANE,"Oh, she did. But trust my mom to turn one of the world's great love stories into a cautionary tale of what happens when children disobey their parents.",2
RORY,So I'm guessing that you're not any closer to telling your parents about Henry.,2
LANE,"I mean, what are the options if I tell them? They hate him, and it's over. They love him, and he therefore becomes odious to me an d it's over. Things are working out fine the way they are.",2
RORY,You mean calling him Rory on the phone in case your mom's listening?,2
LANE,,2
KIM,Lane!,2
LANE,Bye.,2
RORY,Bye.,2
LORELAI,What dost my lady think?,2
RORY,That you're going to be late for the joust?,2
LORELAI,I meant of thy lovely headdress crafted by thy mother's hand artful hand?,2
RORY,"It pleaseth me mu cheth, but uh, hath my beautius mother lookedeth at the time?",2
LORELAI,Oh crap!,2
RORY,Hello?,2
PARIS,"Two other groups are rehearsing at school in the Grand Hall even though I specificallyreserved it for us way in advance and confirmed the reservation twice, but whatever. They're going to be there and I don't want them spying on us.",2
RORY,I don't think the ending to Romeo and Juliet is exactly a secret.,2
PARIS,"Hello, our interpretation?",2
RORY,Oh right.,2
PARIS,I went on the web and I found a site called MissPatty.net. It's in your town.,2
RORY,There's a MissPatty.net?,2
PARIS,Have you heard of it?,2
RORY,Well. . .,2
PARIS,Is it big enough? The site says it's 720 square feet.,2
RORY,"You know, I'd rather just rehearse somewhere else.",2
PARIS,"Look, I've got enough to worry about without you being embarrassed of where you live.",2
RORY,"I'm not embarrassed. I just want to keep my school life separate from my home life, you know?",2
PARIS,Tough. Madeline and Louise are already on their way. See you in half an hour.,2
LORELAI,"Have you seen my bag with the beads and the fur, kind of looks like Stalin's head? Aha.",2
RORY,We're rehearsing here now.,2
LORELAI,What?,2
RORY,Our Shakespeare group. Paris didn't want anyone spying on us so now we're rehearsing in Stars Hollow. This sucks.,2
LORELAI,"Well, at least you don't have to drive to Hartford. What's with the face?",2
RORY,"It's just, Tristin is in our group.",2
LORELAI,"Oh yeah, you told me.",2
RORY,"Right, so Tristin, he's in our group, so that means he's in well, and Dean lives here, so this sucks.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, you know what Vanna? I'm gonna need a few more vowels here.",2
RORY,I have to tell him.,2
LORELAI,Tell who?,2
RORY,Dean?,2
LORELAI,Tell Dean what?,2
RORY,That Tristin and I. . .that we kissed at that stupid party.,2
LORELAI,Oh.,2
RORY,I have no choice.,2
LORELAI,Well ,2
RORY,"Because if Tristin sees Dean, he's gonna tell him. And then it's gonna be worse because it's gonna be like I was keeping it from him.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, let's just calm down now.",2
RORY,"Which I was. I was keeping it from him. I can't believe this, now I have to tell him.",2
LORELAI,You're right.,2
RORY,I am?,2
LORELAI,Mm hmm. I think you should tell him.,2
RORY,"Of course, right, I have to.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah. Then at the play, right as Tristin enters to find you dead and pulls out the vial of poison to k*ll himself, Dean can leap from the audience and rip his head off, adding a level of reality few productions have ever seen before. You'll get an A. The Actors Studio will go nuts. You'll have James Lipton asking you what your favorite swear word is. It's a great plan.",2
RORY,You - not helping.,2
LORELAI,To prevent a homicide? Yes I am.,2
RORY,I have to tell him. I don't have a choice.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, fine. Try it out on me first.",2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,"Pretend I'm Dean. If you're going to tell him this, you'd better have down what you're going to say.",2
RORY,Seriously?,2
LORELAI,Seriously.,2
RORY,Okay. Dean.,2
LORELAI,"Rory. Sorry, serious now.",2
RORY,"Okay, Dean, rememb er last year when we had broken up, and we weren't together anymore because we had broken up ",2
LORELAI,"That's good, mention it three times. Keep going.",2
RORY,"And uh, there was this party, and I went, and, um, Tristin was there. And somehow, I'm not really sure how, we ended up in a room together, and we kissed.",2
LORELAI,You and Tristin?,2
RORY,Uh huh.,2
LORELAI,On the hand?,2
RORY,No.,2
LORELAI,Cheek?,2
RORY,No.,2
LORELAI,He kissed you or you kissed him?,2
RORY,Kind of both.,2
LORELAI,So you kissed him?,2
RORY,Yes.,2
LORELAI,When?,2
RORY,"I already told you three times, when we were broken up!",2
LORELAI,"Okay, not a good idea to yell at him right now.",2
RORY,Sorry.,2
LORELAI,When during the breakup?,2
RORY,What do you mean?,2
LORELAI,"I mean, how long after we broke up did you kiss Tristin?",2
RORY,"Uhh, just  the night after we broke up.",2
LORELAI,You mean the night after I told you I loved you?,2
RORY,Yes.,2
LORELAI,"The next night, after I told you I loved you, you kissed Tristin?",2
RORY,I'm a terrible person!,2
LORELAI,Hold on.,2
RORY,He's absolutely right. He told me he loved me and the next night I go and I kiss Tristin.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, that was me, not Dean.",2
RORY,I hate myself.,2
LORELAI,You didn't do anything wrong. You were hurt and confused and broken up. You did nothingwrong.,2
RORY,Tell that to Dean.,2
LORELAI,"No, because we're not telling Dean anything.",2
RORY,Mom.,2
LORELAI,"Listen to me. I know you are Miss Honesty. I have seen the banner in the closet. But this is the kind of honesty that will only make you feel less guilty, and it's going to hurt Dean very much. It's possibly going to screw up the really good thing you guys have going now. Do you want that?",2
RORY,"No, I don't.",2
LORELAI,All right then. Relax. Be calm. Everything will be fine.,2
RORY,Okay.,2
LORELAI,I gotta go. Can I ask you one more question? Do you think my hair looks cool?,2
RORY,Bye.,2
LORELAI,"'Cause, you know, some days I wake up and I'm like, cool. Some days I'm like, could be cooler.",2
RORY,I won't wait up for you.,2
LORELAI,"Like today I got up and I was like, left side cool, right side not so cool.",2
RORY,Bye.,2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,"Just listen to your breathing and let the world melt away. And in, and out. And in, and out.",2
PARIS,,2
PATTY,"Well, then tell it to go outside and have a smoke. You can't rush a cool down sweetheart.",2
PARIS,,2
PATTY,"Be careful darling, or your face is gonna freeze like that.",2
RORY,Hey.,2
LOUISE,What's with the cast from Co coon?,2
PARIS,Where's Tristin? He said he was coming with you.,2
MADELINE,"Oh, he's here. He just went over to the market.",2
RORY,What?,2
LOUISE,"He needed cigarettes, just in case we didn't already know that he was bad.",2
RORY,"Umm, I'll be right back.",2
PARIS,Where are you going?,2
RORY,I'll just be a sec.,2
PARIS,,2
TRISTIN,"Excuse me stockboy, could you tell me where I can find the shortneing? Now that is a fine looking apron. I mean it, I mean, really sensational.",2
DEAN,What are you doing here?,2
TRISTIN,"Well, to be honest, there's something I wanted to ask you. In your professional opinion, which one of these would make my cakes fluffier?",2
DEAN,You drove all the way out here just to be a jerk. There aren't enough people who can't stand you in Hartford.,2
TRISTIN,"Oh, no. I'm here for Rory.",2
DEAN,What?,2
TRISTIN,"Yeah, the play. Romeo and Juliet.",2
DEAN,What about it?,2
TRISTIN,"I'm Romeo, and she's Juliet. Hey, come on, she must've told you. She did tell you, didn't she?",2
DEAN,"Look, I think you better leave.",2
TRISTIN,"Oops! God I am so sorry. I am such a klutz. Here, let me. This should cover it.",2
DEAN,"You know what, I hope for Rory's sake that you got an understudy.",2
RORY,"Dean, hi!",2
DEAN,"Rory, what is he doing here?",2
RORY,I need to talk to you.,2
DEAN,I got something to settle with this guy.,2
RORY,,2
DEAN,"All right, I'm outside.",2
RORY,"I'm really sorry I didn't tell you about this before, but Tristin ",2
DEAN,"Is playing Romeo to your Juliet. Yeah, I heard.",2
RORY,"But he wasn't even in our group at first, but then no one else wanted him, and then Paris moved the rehearsal spot to here, and she did it today and I didn't have time to tell you.",2
DEAN,You and Tristin wind up thrown together a lot at that school.,2
RORY,"It's just a project, that's all, nothing more.",2
DEAN,"You and Tristin playing Romeo and Juliet. Perfect. Really, really amazing.",2
RORY,I know you hate it.,2
DEAN,"Yeah, I hate it. I really hate it.",2
RORY,"But we do the scene on Sunday, and then it's over. And it's back to, Tristin? Who? I don't ... I don't know Tristin.",2
DEAN,You must mean that young boy who got mysteriously strangled by a Doose's market apron one night.,2
RORY,"I heard about that. Awful. They say dr*gs were involved. Please don't be mad. I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry.",2
DEAN,"Sorry about what? You didn't. . .you didn't choose to do this with him, right?",2
RORY,"No, I didn't.",2
DEAN,Then what do you have to be sorry for?,2
RORY,That. . .that I didn't tell you about the rehearsal. And that No Doubt is touring with U2. I know you're extremely disappointed in Bono.,2
DEAN,"All right, so, so when's this thing over?",2
RORY,Sunday.,2
DEAN,"Okay. I'm gonna walk around the block, just get him out of the market.",2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,"Oh, thank goodness, you ordered. I am starving.",2
RORY,What are you doing here? I thought you went out to dinner.,2
LORELAI,"Well, I did go out to dinner.",2
RORY,Then why are you eating mine?,2
LORELAI,"Well, he took me to this darling little place called Minnie's. Very hip, very chic, very small portions.",2
RORY,So how'd it go?,2
LORELAI,Well ,2
RORY,Aww.,2
LORELAI,"You know, we talked about all the things we had in common and then the salad came.",2
RORY,Not a soulmate?,2
LORELAI,He's never seen Ab Fab.,2
RORY,Definitely not a soulmate.,2
LORELAI,"Plus, he's outdoorsy. Rememb er that Meryl Streep movie where she and her family take a rafting trip and then psycho Kevin Bacon forces them to take 'em down the river?",2
RORY,Yeah.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, that's his dream vacation, minus Kevin Bacon.",2
RORY,Wow.,2
LORELAI,"Whereas mine is Kevin Bacon, minus the river, so...",2
RORY,"Hey, moving on.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah. But I must say, I'm really glad I went tonight.",2
RORY,Yeah?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah. I mean, it was fun to kinda get dressed up and have a freshly laundered man open the door for me. And the best part about it was, it was no big deal. I mean, we laughed a little, we hugged goodnight, I'll never date him again, but I do believe the burrito bit will live on. It was a totally casual date. I am now officially a casual dater.",2
RORY,That's great. And we can celebrate by getting you your own plate of fries.,2
LORELAI,Huh.,2
RORY,"Hey Luke, can we get another round?",2
LUKE,Coming right up.,2
LORELAI,So tell me ab out the big rehearsal.,2
RORY,"We got off to a shaky start, and Louise acts like she's the priest in a Madonna video, but by the end, we were not half bad.",2
LORELAI,Good good.,2
RORY,Tristin ran into Dean.,2
LORELAI,"Ugh, bad bad.",2
RORY,It's okay though because I pulled them apart without any bloodshed and I explained it all to Dean.,2
LORELAI,You explained it all to Dean?,2
RORY,I told him that Tristin wasn't supposed to be in our group and Paris moved the rehearsal to Miss Patty's at the last minute and that's why he didn't know about it.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, that version of all.",2
RORY,But Dean's fine now.,2
LORELAI,He's fine?,2
RORY,He's fine.,2
LUKE,You want a burger too?,2
LORELAI,"Hmm, no, I'll just have half of hers.",2
RORY,One burger please.,2
LUKE,You look all dressed up.,2
LORELAI,Do I? Because I feel very casual.,2
DEAN,Hey.,2
RORY,"Hi, you just got off work?",2
DEAN,Yup.,2
LORELAI,Hey Dean. Do you want some fries?,2
DEAN,"No, I'm actually going home for dinner. My mom made fried chicken tonight and she saved me some.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, you have a cooking mom.",2
RORY,That's so nice.,2
LORELAI,"Well, she may make chicken, but is she a casual dater?",2
RORY,I hope not. She's married.,2
DEAN,Do I wanna know what either one of you is talking about?,2
LUKE,Nope.,2
RORY,My mother casually dated tonight.,2
DEAN,"Oh, well, congratulations.",2
LORELAI,Thank you. Thank you very much.,2
DEAN,"So, I was wondering what time your rehearsal was tomorrow?",2
RORY,"Five, why?",2
DEAN,"Well, uh, it's my night off and I thought maybe I'd come by and watch.",2
RORY,Watch what?,2
DEAN,Watch you.,2
RORY,Watch me do what?,2
DEAN,Rehearse.,2
RORY,"Oh. Um, Dean, I think you'd be really bored watching rehearsal.",2
LORELAI,"Oh yeah, I've dozed off twice just listening to her talk about rehearsal.",2
DEAN,"Well, I won't be bored.",2
RORY,We don't even know our lines yet. You should just come on Sunday.,2
LORELAI,"That's a good idea. After all, Sunday is the day of rest and that's what you'll be doing - resting, 'cause it's boring.",2
RORY,Mom.,2
LORELAI,"Well, honey, it's not your fault. You didn't write the damn thing.",2
DEAN,"Well, I'll come on Sunday too.",2
RORY,"Okay. But if you're gonna go on Sunday, you don't want to spoil it for yourself.",2
DEAN,What? It's not like I don't know how it ends.,2
RORY,"Okay, Dean, look ",2
DEAN,"Rory, come on. I'll sit in the back, you'll die, and I'll walk you home. It's no big deal, right?",2
RORY,Right.,2
DEAN,"Good, so I'll see you tomorrow.",2
RORY,"Yup, you sure will.",2
DEAN,Bye Lorelai.,2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,"Excuse me Tristin, can I talk to you for a second?",2
TRISTIN,"I'll meet you guys later, okay? I'm all yours.",2
RORY,I need to talk to you about something serious.,2
TRISTIN,"Serious, huh? I'm intrigued.",2
RORY,Dean's coming to rehearsal tonight.,2
TRISTIN,"Wow, are you sure they can spare him? I mean, what if there's a run on baked beans?",2
RORY,"Can you just shut up for five seconds, please? Thank you. Look, as I said, Dean is coming to rehearsal tonight, and I'd like to ask you to promise that you won't say anything to him about what happened.",2
TRISTIN,What happened?,2
RORY,At the party?,2
TRISTIN,At the party?,2
RORY,"Tristin! You and me, at Madeline's party? You had just been kicked to the curb by Summer, and I found you sulking on a piano bench, and I sat down, we talked, and then we kissed.",2
TRISTIN,That was you?,2
RORY,"You know what, forget it.",2
TRISTIN,"Hey, Rory.",2
RORY,"There is no point in talking to you. I knew that, yet I tried. Won't happen again.",2
TRISTIN,You don't want me to tell Dean that we kissed.,2
RORY,"By George, I think he's got it.",2
TRISTIN,"Okay, if that's what you want.",2
RORY,It is.,2
TRISTIN,"Although, he's gonna find out anyway.",2
RORY,What?,2
TRISTIN,"Well, come on, you know that when we kiss on stage, it's gonna be pretty obvious that it's not the first time. I'm a good actor, but I can't hide that kind of passion.",2
RORY,"Look, things are really good for me and Dean right now, and I don't want anything to mess that up. Especially not something that meant nothing at all to me and I wished had never happened in the first place.",2
TRISTIN,"So things are going good for you too, huh?",2
RORY,"Yeah, they are.",2
TRISTIN,"Good, that's good.",2
RORY,So what do you think? You just took those out.,2
TRISTIN,"Well, I changed my mind.",2
RORY,Are you all right?,2
TRISTIN,"Yeah, I think somehow I'll recover from the great romance between you and the Beave.",2
RORY,"A lot of stuff's been going on with you lately, huh?",2
TRISTIN,Meaning?,2
RORY,"Just, you know, the car thing, the suspension thing, a lot of drama.",2
TRISTIN,Well I get bored easily.,2
RORY,Just doesn't really seem like you.,2
TRISTIN,And you know me now?,2
RORY,I know you don't get suspended for stupid pranks.,2
TRISTIN,"I pulled stuff like that before I knew Duncan and Bowman, all right?",2
RORY,"Well, if you did, you didn't get caught. You're getting caught a lot.",2
TRISTIN,Your point being?,2
RORY,"Maybe Duncan and Bowman aren't the best people to be hanging out with. They're not as smart as you Tristin, they don't have what you have going for you. They ",2
TRISTIN,,2
LORELAI,Taking pity on your burger?,2
RORY,Not hungry.,2
LORELAI,"Honey, you've got to eat. You're gonna k*ll yourself in a couple of hours, you really need your strength.",2
RORY,Ha ha.,2
LORELAI,Maybe Dean won't even come tonight.,2
RORY,"Oh, he'll be there. There aren't enough monster truck rallies in the world to keep him away from Miss Patty's tonight.",2
LORELAI,"All right, that's it. This afternoon we are going to engage in some intensive retail therapy to bring you out of this funk.",2
RORY,No thanks.,2
LORELAI,I mean it. Today is the day we finally spring for the Powerpuff girl shotglasses.,2
RORY,"Hmm, I can't. I promised Lane I'd help her pick out an outfit for the play tomorrow.",2
PAULorelai,Lorelai?,2
LORELAI,Yeah?,2
PAULorelai,"Hey, it is you. This is Lorelai, she's the girl I told you about.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, Paul. I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you with the hat.",2
PAULorelai,Yeah.,2
LORELAI,What are you doing here?,2
PAULorelai,"Well, um, getting some coffee.",2
LORELAI,In Stars Hollow?,2
PAULorelai,"Well, you know, you talked so much about the town the other night and especially Luke's place, so my mom's crazy for coffee, I thought I'd bring 'em up here for breakfast.",2
RORY,The other night?,2
LORELAI,"Uh, yes. Paul's my friend from the other night, the uh, casual Wednesday.",2
RORY,Oh.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, Paul, I want you to meet my daughter Rory.",2
PAULorelai,"Hi, nice to meet you. Hey, these are my parents, Dorie and Sid.",2
DORIE,Nice to meet you.,2
SID,"Pleasure, really.",2
LORELAI,"Oh yeah, me too.",2
LUKE,You ordering?,2
PAULorelai,Luke. Are you Luke? Is this Luke?,2
LORELAI,"Yes, that's Luke.",2
PAULorelai,"Oh man! Mom, Dad, that is Luke.",2
DORIE,We've heard so much about you.,2
SID,Darn shame ab out that Rachel.,2
LUKE,"Who the hell are these people? LORELAI; Uh, Paul is my friend from business school.",2
PAULorelai,"Yeah, we went out the other night. And uh, you know, she talked about a few people in this town, and you being one of 'em, so nice to meet you.",2
LUKE,Yeah.,2
PAULorelai,"Um, okay, three coffees to go then.",2
LORELAI,Something funny?,2
RORY,No.,2
LORELAI,You're just smiling for no reason?,2
RORY,I'm a happy person.,2
PAULorelai,"Hey, I've gotta run. Mom wants to go antiquing, so it was nice meeting you, and uh, I'll see you in class Lorelai.",2
LORELAI,Bye. Bye now. Bye.,2
LORELAI,What?,2
RORY,Nothing.,2
LORELAI,Say it!,2
RORY,I've always wanted a little brother.,2
LORELAI,He looked older the other night!,2
RORY,How much older could he possibly look?,2
LORELAI,"A lot! He's usually a little scruffy, and then the baseball cap hides the funky hair thing.",2
RORY,He should've been holding a yo-yo and a lollipop and wearing a beanie with a propeller on it.,2
LORELAI,He's in his twenties.,2
RORY,He must have been a very good boy to deserve such a happy day. I bet they let him ride a pony.,2
LORELAI,Aren't you supposed to go help Lane?,2
RORY,Thanks for cheering me up.,2
LORELAI,What? You wanna say something too?,2
LUKE,Nope.,2
LORELAI,Please don't hold back on my account.,2
LUKE,I wouldn't.,2
LORELAI,Good.,2
LUKE,Would you guys mind moving down a couple stools? Make me more comfortable.,2
LORELAI,This is me leaving.,2
LUKE,"Hey, how do I know what the cutoff is?",2
LORELAI,"And no tip, I wonder why.",2
LUKE,"I mean, at least if you had one of those height bars like at amusement park rides ",2
LORELAI,,2
TRISTIN,"Here's to my love. Oh true apothecary, thy dr*gs are quick. Line?",2
PARIS,"Thus with a kiss, I die. How hard is that to remember?",2
TRISTIN,"Thus with a kiss, I die. Right. And then I kiss he, right?",2
PARIS,"Yes. You say 'Thus with a kiss, I die.' Then you kiss her and die. Why are you smiling? You think this is a joke? The performance is tomorrow.",2
TRISTIN,"Wait, tomorrow? Oh my God. I totally missed it the first 47 times you said it.",2
PARIS,I warned you. I am not going to fail this because of you. I will replace you with Brad in a second.,2
BRAD,"Oh, dear God, no.",2
RORY,Can we just get through the scene?,2
MADELINE,Please.,2
PARIS,Fine. But yell line once more and you're out. Start memorizing.,2
TRISTIN,"Oh true apothecary, thy dr*gs are quick. Thus with a kiss, I die.",2
PARIS,What?,2
TRISTIN,"Well, it's just, with this being our last kiss and all, it makes me think about our first kiss. You know, at the party.",2
RORY,What?,2
PARIS,"Lie down, you're dead.",2
LOUISE,We all are.,2
TRISTIN,You rememb er the kiss. In Act 1 at the Capulet's masked party?,2
PARIS,What about it?,2
TRISTIN,"Well, I was just trying to think of something that would make this kiss as special as that one.",2
RORY,Tristin.,2
TRISTIN,I thought she could cry.,2
RORY,What?,2
PARIS,"She's dead. You're dead, lie down.",2
TRISTIN,"Yeah, but that's the beauty of it. No one would expect her to cry.",2
DEAN,I would.,2
TRISTIN,"You know, funny you should say that ",2
RORY,I need to take five.,2
PARIS,You know what? Let's all take five. That way you can all cancel whatever plans you had tonight because we are staying here until we get this right.,2
LOUISE,Who could you possibly be calling?,2
DEAN,He is unbelievable.,2
RORY,"Dean, I really need you to leave.",2
DEAN,What?,2
RORY,"The play is tomorrow, and it's fifty percent of my grade, and you standing there staring atTristin, it's like a challenge or something.",2
DEAN,"Well, I don't like the way he's messing with you.",2
RORY,"I don't like it either but we have to get through this scene and we can't get through the scene with you standing there. So, Dean, please.",2
DEAN,Fine. Call me later.,2
TRISTIN,Now I noticed you didn't cry when you kissed him. I'm starting to feel a little insecure.,2
RORY,What is wrong with you?,2
TRISTIN,"Whoa, I think I liked you better comatose.",2
RORY,I thought you weren't going to say anything.,2
TRISTIN,Did I say that?,2
RORY,You make it impossible for anyone to be nice to you. No wonder you had to join our group. Anyone who's actually suffered through the experience of going out with you would absolutely know better.,2
TRISTIN,"Gee, I really wish we could continue your analysis on how pathetic I am. Unfortunately, I have to meet some friends.",2
PARIS,"Where are you going? Where is he going? We're not finished! Hey, I'm the director here! Tristin!",2
BRAD,,2
SOOKIE,"Ooh! I'm so excited! Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet, it's so romantic. Oh Romeo, blah bah blah and the blah. That's all the Shakespeare I know.",2
LORELAI,"Hey Luke, you should come w ith us to Chilton and watch Rory perform.",2
LUKE,Can't.,2
LORELAI,Come on. How often do you get to see teenagers speak iambic pentameter and k*ll themselves?,2
LUKE,No thanks. But you have a good time. Bring plenty of baseball cards to pass out your phone number on.,2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,"Lorelai, there you are you naughty, naughty girl.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, he was not that much younger than I am. I met him a business school, not his Bar Mitzvah. Business school has to indicate some kind of maturity, right?",2
LUKE,Doogie Howser was a doctor at sixteen.,2
LORELAI,Doogie Howser was not real.,2
LUKE,How sad for you.,2
LORELAI,"Luke. This is incredible. I go on one stupid date, and suddenly I'm the female Jerry Lee Lewis.",2
SOOKIE,"Oh forget it honey. The town likes to tease. Plus, he did look really young.",2
LORELAI,You didn't even see him.,2
SOOKIE,Kirk snapped pictures.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, you. What is up with you?",2
LUKE,Nothing's up with me.,2
LORELAI,Well we were having a perfectly nasty verbal sparring match and you suddenly walk away.,2
BOOTSY,"Lorelai, I hear you're dating a kid.",2
LORELAI,Please let something big fall on my head.,2
BOOTSY,"When I was 18, I was dating an older lady. Broke my heart.",2
LORELAI,"Well, Bootsy, I'm sorry you got dumped, but I'm not dating a kid.",2
BOOTSY,"I didn't get dumped, she died. Heart attack. She was quite old.",2
LORELAI,Hey.,2
LUKE,I'm working. Us older guys do that.,2
LORELAI,Why are you being so mean to me?,2
LUKE,I'm not being mean.,2
LORELAI,Yes you are. You're being mean.,2
LUKE,"Sookie, am I being mean?",2
SOOKIE,"Well, I wouldn't pay you to put on a red nose and work a birthday party right now.",2
LUKE,Thank God for that.,2
LORELAI,Why are you so mad at me?,2
LUKE,I just think it's embarrassing.,2
LORELAI,What is so embarrassing?,2
LUKE,You running around with that kid.,2
LORELAI,"I wasn't running, he's not a kid. We had dinner. You say Chuck E. Cheese, I'll break your nose.",2
LUKE,,2
BOY,"Ooh, ooh. He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But, soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.",2
SOOKIE,Are you sure this is Shakespeare?,2
DEAN,What's with all the grunting?,2
LORELAI,"I wish Luke was here, he could translate for us.",2
RORY,Hey.,2
DEAN,Oh hey.,2
LORELAI,Hi.,2
SOOKIE,"Oh honey, look at you! You look like a princess! Doesn't she look like a princess?",2
DEAN,"Yeah, she looks beautiful.",2
RORY,Mom mad e the dress.,2
LORELAI,Not to mention the girl inside it.,2
RORY,"Hello, gross.",2
LORELAI,I'm just saying.,2
RORY,I'm getting kind of nervous.,2
LANE,"Oh, you're gonna be great.",2
RORY,I think act three is starting up.,2
LANE,"Henry's act. Um, how do I look?",2
RORY,You might want to hold a phone up to your face so he'll recognize you.,2
LANE,Okay.,2
PARIS,,2
PARIS,He's not here.,2
RORY,Who's not here?,2
PARIS,"Tristin. I've looked everywhere. I called his home, his cell, I called three girls I know he's seeing.",2
RORY,"Paris, calm down.",2
PARIS,Weren't you listening? He's not here. We're on in twenty minutes and we don't have a Romeo. We are going to fail.,2
RORY,We're not going to fail.,2
PARIS,"Do you think Harvard accepts people who fail Shakespeare? They don't. I don't have the numbers on it or anything, but I feel pretty secure in saying, you fail Shakespeare, you don't get into Harvard.",2
RORY,"Okay, maybe he's just in one of the bathrooms smoking.",2
PARIS,,2
HENRY,,2
PARIS,"I knew he was going to do this, but no one wanted to listen to me. It was all, let's make Tristin Romeo, he's hot.",2
RORY,What about Brad?,2
PARIS,"Brad transferred schools. Where have you been? You have to get dressed, we're on in ten minutes.",2
TRISTIN,Can't.,2
PARIS,What?,2
TRISTIN,"Actually, my dad had me pulled out of school. He    and is she unhappy.",2
RORY,What do you mean he had you pulled out of school? What happened?,2
TRISTIN,"Nothing. Just ticked the old man off, that's all.",2
RORY,"By doing what? Tristin, come on, tell me.",2
TRISTIN,I got in some trouble.,2
RORY,Trouble involving?,2
TRISTIN,"Involving Duncan and Bowman, and Bowman's dad's safe.",2
RORY,Oh no.,2
TRISTIN,"I mean, Bowman had a key. It was supposed to be no big deal. And the crazy silent alarm kicked in.",2
RORY,You broke into Bowman's dad's safe?,2
TRISTIN,Yes.,2
RORY,Stupid.,2
TRISTIN,Yes.,2
RORY,"Well, okay, you can apologize and you can put back the money and you can explain that, I don't know, you were going through something.",2
TRISTIN,"I was, I was going through his safe.",2
RORY,Why would you do this?,2
TRISTIN,I don't know. I guess that's something I can ponder at military school.,2
RORY,Military school?,2
TRISTIN,"The police are letting our parents handle it, and in my case that means military school in North Carolina.",2
RORY,I don't know what to say.,2
TRISTIN,"Well, I imagine you're overwhelmed with the relief in knowing that soon I will be gone.",2
RORY,I'm so sorry.,2
TRISTIN,"Well, I'm a big boy. I can handle it.",2
RORY,There's nothing you can  MR.,2
Dugray,"Tristin, come on.",2
TRISTIN,"I gotta go. So, I might kiss you goodbye but, uh, your boyfriend's watching. Take care of yourself, Mary.",2
PARIS,,2
PARIS,,2
SOOKIE,"Wasn't that great? I mean, just watching it made me feel smarter. Don't you feel smarter?",2
LORELAI,"Well, just the opposite actually.",2
SOOKIE,We should do something else good for us. Go to a museum or play chess.,2
LORELAI,I promised Rory we'd go to Luke's afterwards.,2
SOOKIE,"Oh, even better.",2
LORELAI,"Although, I gotta tell ya, I am still pretty peeved by how he acted earlier. I swear, that guy runs so hot and cold on me.",2
SOOKIE,What?,2
LORELAI,"Well, one minute he's all sweet and building me a chuppah, and the next he's being a total jerk for God knows what reason.",2
SOOKIE,For God knows what reason? Come on Lorelai.,2
LORELAI,What?,2
SOOKIE,Don't you understand that Luke is so into you?,2
LORELAI,"Okay, stop.",2
SOOKIE,"He has had to watch you go from one guy to another, and then the engagement, and then the engagement was off, and patiently he's waited. And now in walks this kid and he says, 'My God, will she date anyone else in the world before she'll date me?'",2
LORELAI,"Sookie, that ",2
SOOKIE,,2
DEAN,"So, did you and Paris actually kiss or was that like a stage thing?",2
RORY,A lady never kisses and tells.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, you guys get a table. I'll be right there.",2
LORELAI,Hey.,2
LUKE,,2
LORELAI,"Oh, you know, I think Shakespeare will recover.",2
LUKE,That's good.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, are you good at dating?",2
LUKE,What?,2
LORELAI,"Dating, do you have that down?",2
LUKE,"Okay, if this is about that kid, then ",2
LORELAI,"No, it's not about anything, it's just a question.",2
LUKE,"Well, I don't know if I have it down. Considering I live with my nephew, I'd say probably not.",2
LORELAI,"I don't have it down either. I've never been very good at it really. I've never even really liked it. Too much 'what if'. I like things I can count on. I mean, uh, actually, with Max, it was the first time I was finally like 'Hey, here it is, that one person who will always be there for me.' And then, I turned around, and it's suddenly 'Oops, wrong, keep moving.'",2
LUKE,Why are you telling me this?,2
LORELAI,"I don't have very many people in my life who are in my life permanently forever. They will always be there for me. I will always be there for them, you know? There's Rory, and Sookie, and this town and ... you. I mean, at least I think I've got...",2
LUKE,You do.,2
LORELAI,Good. Just checking,2
LUKE,Tell me ab out Romeo and Juliet.,2
LORELAI,"Well, it's so depressing because everybody dies, but the clothes were so cute.",2
LUKE,Life can be funny that way.,2

LORELAI,How do you like that mouth?,2
RORY,"Um, it's not very mouthlike.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, I think it works.",2
RORY,It's tilted to the side.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, no, it was intentional. It gives her a unique expression.",2
RORY,Like she had a stroke?,2
LORELAI,"Fine, I'll just use the Mrs. Potato Head lips.",2
RORY,"No, forget it, leave stroke-mouth. It's not like we're gonna win this anyway.",2
LORELAI,"Whoa, bad attitude.",2
RORY,"Mom, face it. That is the single most incredible snowman I have ever seen.",2
LORELAI,"I'm sorry, that snowman is way over the top, way too showy. It's screaming 'I'm incredible, I'm special, look at me.'",2
RORY,Kind of the point of a snowman-building contest.,2
LORELAI,"Hmm, I hate this man with every fiber of my being.",2
RORY,He looks nice.,2
LORELAI,He's a ringer.,2
RORY,How do you figure?,2
Posted,12/22/01 19:16,2
LORELAI,"Someone recruited him, promised him a handsome sum, financed his theatrical snowman accoutrements, so he could snatch victory away from a deserving local in order to bag the contest prize for himself.",2
RORY,Seems a little elaborate considering that the prize is a set of new US quarters.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, we're ignoring him now. So, what are we gonna do on your school break?",2
RORY,A lot of nothing.,2
LORELAI,Sounds good.,2
RORY,Plus some homework.,2
LORELAI,And a lot of movies.,2
RORY,"Oh, we have to rent Godfather 3 on DVD.",2
LORELAI,You're kidding.,2
RORY,"In the audio commen tary, Coppola actually defends casting Sofia.",2
LORELAI,Now that is fatherly love. What's all this homework you have to do?,2
RORY,Just stuff for the paper.,2
LORELAI,What? Why?,2
RORY,"Because Paris wants the first issue back to be a double issue, so we have to prep over break and she says the news never sleeps.",2
LORELAI,"What about Paris, does she ever sleep?",2
RORY,I think she periodically makes a whirring noise and then just shuts down.,2
LORELAI,"Well, you can't work the whole time.",2
RORY,"I won't, I promise. Oh my God.",2
LORELAI,What?,2
RORY,He's power buffing.,2
LORELAI,"Aw, now that is just wrong.",2
RORY,We're competing against the Michelangelo of snow.,2
LORELAI,And we're Ernest Builds a Snowman.,2
RORY,We shouldn't look at him anymore.,2
LORELAI,"Heads down, stay focused.",2
RORY,We can do this.,2
LORELAI,Absolutely.,2
RORY,Let's get some coffee?,2
LORELAI,,2
MICHELorelai,"Yes, you can rent a car in Manhattan and return it in Hartford. That's that's no problem, sir. Yes. Yes, you can return it to Bradley International. That's that's very convenient. Or you you can um, you - hold please.",2
RUNE,Ah!,2
MICHELorelai,Stop that.,2
RUNE,Stop what?,2
MICHELorelai,Stop jumping like a Mexican bean.,2
RUNE,"Well, Lorelai asked me to dust the picture frames. How do you suggest that I clean the top, smartie? Well, I didn't know that you could do that.",2
MICHELorelai,"Yes, I am mir aculously talented, aren't I?",2
RUNE,I thought an alarm would go off like in The Thomas Crown Affair.,2
MICHELorelai,"That would be if this was a museum, and you were a man allowed in museums.",2
LORELAI,"Hey, no bickering in the lobby, guys.",2
RUNE,,2
SOOKIE,You've got all the mushrooms? You double checked?,2
JACKSON,I've triple checked. I've quadruple checked.,2
SOOKIE,"The shitake, the nameko, the chanterelle?",2
JACKSON,"Once again, I've got it all.",2
SOOKIE,The matsutake? The makeniya?,2
JACKSON,Uh wait.,2
SOOKIE,What?,2
JACKSON,I don't have makeniya.,2
SOOKIE,You don't have makeniya?,2
JACKSON,I don't have makeniya.,2
SOOKIE,I made it up. You passed the test.,2
JACKSON,Don't test me.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, the auditions are starting. You wanna come watch?",2
SOOKIE,"Ooh, yes!",2
JACKSON,Auditions for what?,2
SOOKIE,Musicians.,2
LORELAI,For the Bracebridge Dinner.,2
JACKSON,"Geez, you guys are going crazy with this dinner.",2
SOOKIE,"Jackson, I told you, this dinner is not just about food. We are recreating an authentic 19th century meal.",2
LORELAI,"The servers are all gonna be in period clothing, they're gonna speak period English. Here, look at the costumes.",2
JACKSON,Nice.,2
SOOKIE,"We're talking seven courses here. Soup, fish, Peacock Pie, the Baron of Beef, the salad, then the Plum Pudding and the Wassail.",2
LORELAI,And there's gonna be a big raised platform where the Squire of Bracebridge is going to preside over the festivities.,2
SOOKIE,"Yeah, he tastes the foods and makes pronouncements. He's like the host of the evening, and his costume is the coolest.",2
LORELAI,Ah.,2
JACKSON,It all sounds great.,2
SOOKIE,"Oh, it is, it is. By the way, you're playing Squire Bracebridge. Ready?",2
LORELAI,Let's go.,2
SOOKIE,Yeah.,2
JACKSON,,2
SOOKIE,What are we looking at today?,2
LORELAI,"Okay, this is the last on our list. We've already got our trumpets, our madrigal singers ",2
JACKSON,"Uh, sorry to interrupt but I'm not playing Squire Bracebridge.",2
LORELAI,"We've got all our servers lined up. This is just for recorder players and harpists. Hi. Uh, lay some on us guys.",2
SOOKIE,"Hey, you cats really know how to blow those things.",2
LORELAI,You've got the gig. I will call you later with the details. Thanks.,2
JACKSON,So are we clear on this? I'm not playing Squire Bracebridge. Sorry you were under the impression that I'd do this.,2
SOOKIE,When do the guests arrive?,2
LORELAI,Thursday at four - on their own jet.,2
SOOKIE,After buying out the whole inn.,2
LORELAI,Must be nice to have money.,2
SOOKIE,"Uh! Hey, you know what struck me today?",2
JACKSON,Was it the fact that I'm not the Squire - did that strike you?,2
SOOKIE,We are crazy for doing this.,2
LORELAI,We're beyond crazy. We are 'Anne Heche speaking her secret language to God and looking for the spaceship in Fresno' crazy.,2
SOOKIE,"Oh Quiness, nokka don atta.",2
LORELAI,Il ek notra doska donne.,2
JACKSON,"And springing this on me at the last minute too, I mean, that's just manipulative.",2
CHEF,"Sookie, fire!",2
SOOKIE,I gotta get back in the kitchen. You'll handle the harp?,2
LORELAI,You got it.,2
JACKSON,"All right, okay, I'll do it. I'll play Squire Bracebridge if that's what you want. Geez.",2
SOOKIE,Thanks Sweetie.,2
JACKSON,"As long as it's not just because I fit the costume. It's because I fit the costume, isn't it?",2
LORELAI,Go ahead.,2
LORELAI,"Hi, it's Lorelai.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Hey Lor, it's me.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, hi Chris, how are you?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Good, good. You, uh, got a minute?",2
LORELAI,Uh oh.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"It's not an uh oh, I just wanted to run an idea by you.",2
LORELAI,Run it.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Now it's totally your call and I don't want to step on any plans you've already made, but I know Rory has a break in school coming up, and I was wondering if you'd be cool with her coming to visit for a couple of days.",2
LORELAI,"Uhh, a couple of days? You mean she'd stay the night?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Yeah, it's totally your call. Where are you, heaven?",2
LORELAI,Do you even have room for someone to stay?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Not just room - a room. A designated guest room. Sherry fixed it up really nice.,2
LORELAI,"Aww, good for her.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,So what do you think?,2
LORELAI,I don't know. It's awfully last minute.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,It's totally last minute. You can say no and there'll be no hard feelings.,2
LORELAI,"Well, it's really up to Rory to say yes or no.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,So you're cool with it?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, sure, if Rory is, yeah.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Great, that's great. Uh, thank you. I'll let you run it past her and you can get back to me w henever. No pressure.",2
LORELAI,No pressure.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Talk to you later.,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,So what are your travel plans Dad?,2
RICHARD,Hmm?,2
LORELAI,"You and mom, you always go out of town this time of year.",2
RORY,Last year it was the Bahamas.,2
RICHARD,"Yes, that's right, it was.",2
LORELAI,I rememb er you had fun too. You said the Bahama mians were real nice. The Bahamites? The Bahamamamamians?,2
RORY,The Bahamians.,2
LORELAI,Yes. They were nice.,2
EMILY,They were nice.,2
LORELAI,"So, what are your plans?",2
EMILY,We're not going anywhere this year.,2
RORY,"Why not? Oh, well yeah, it can be really nice just to stay at home sometimes because you can do fun things that you normally wouldn't have time for.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, like play Running Charades, and get out that Slip 'n Slide.",2
RICHARD,We'll see.,2
EMILY,"Yes, we'll see.",2
RICHARD,"Would you all excuse me? I have to make some calls. Say goodbye before you leave, will you?",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, sure Dad.",2
LORELAI,When is this awfulness with work gonna resolve itself?,2
EMILY,I don't know. The man is so sensitive. He reads so much into every little perceived slight.,2
LORELAI,,2
SOOKIE,"Keep in mind during the Bracebridge Dinner, we are not just servers, we are performers, so any time you're with a guest, you must be in character and you must speak Old English. It's a world we're creating here, so whatever we can do Kirk, you're driving me crazy!",2
KIRK,"Who me? 'Whatever we can do to Kirk you're driving me crazy.' Yeah, me. Ah, sorry.",2
SOOKIE,"Okay, now guys, look at the materials I gave you, and tell me if a guest asks you how the food's coming, what would be the appropriate Old English response? Rune!",2
RUNE,Greetings!,2
SOOKIE,"You just read the first thing on the list, didn't you?",2
RUNE,Maybe.,2
SOOKIE,"Guys, the correct",2
response,"Ah, oven's day with baked meat choke!",2
RUNE,Question?,2
SOOKIE,Yeah?,2
RUNE,What color dress will I be wearing when I say this?,2
JACKSON,"Rune, don't be an idiot.",2
RUNE,"Well, this is stupid.",2
JACKSON,Shut up and pay attention to Sookie. She worked very hard to bring this about.,2
KIRK,"Yes, but unfortunately we don't all share intimacies with her, so she doesn't cut us any slack.",2
JACKSON,She doesn't treat me differently.,2
KIRK,She's called you Peaches three times. It's all in the transcript.,2
RUNE,"Sookie, instead of talking in Old English, can I just talk like an old man?",2
SOOKIE,What?,2
RUNE,"Hey you kids, get off my lawn!",2
SOOKIE,"No, no you cannot just talk like an old man.",2
SOOKIE,"Hi, honey, what's the matter?",2
LORELAI,They're snowed in.,2
SOOKIE,Who's snowed in?,2
LORELAI,The Bracebridge group. They're stuck in Chicago. The dinner's off.,2
SOOKIE,No.,2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
SOOKIE,I'm gonna cry.,2
LORELAI,I offered to fund the instant invention of a molecular transport device but they just didn't go for it.,2
SOOKIE,"Oh, that makes me so mad. And so sad. I'm smad!",2
RUNE,,2
SOOKIE,"I've got thirty pounds of aged beef, trays and trays of trout, mountains of pruned tarts. I diced pumpkins until my hands turned orange. I've got pumpkin hands.",2
LORELAI,Take a sip,2
SOOKIE,How can you stay so calm about this?,2
LORELAI,There's nothing we can do about it.,2
RORY,I can't believe they got snowed in.,2
LORELAI,"All that work, all that extra help we hired. Oh well. At least they paid for it already. We didn't lose any money.",2
SOOKIE,"Yeah I guess. You know, I could still make up the dinner for the three of us.",2
RORY,"Yeah, but then it would be like the three of us, all alone in the dining room.",2
LORELAI,"It would be like The Shining, except instead of Jack Nicholson, we have Rune.",2
LUKE,You girls want anything besides coffee?,2
SOOKIE,"Hey, what about Luke?",2
LUKE,What about him?,2
SOOKIE,"He eats, and Jess eats. Doesn't Jess eat?",2
LUKE,What's she doing?,2
LORELAI,I think she's inviting you for dinner.,2
SOOKIE,"Yeah, come on, join us. It'll be fun. You like Peacock Pie?",2
LUKE,I'm a hundred percent sure I don't.,2
LORELAI,There'll be normal food too.,2
RORY,And decorations.,2
SOOKIE,And music.,2
LORELAI,"Come on, it'll be fun.",2
LUKE,Well ,2
LORELAI,"Hey, you know what? Let's invite everyone.",2
SOOKIE,Everyone who?,2
LORELAI,Everyone everyone.,2
SOOKIE,Everyone everyone who?,2
LORELAI,"Everyone we know, everyone we like.",2
RORY,"And they could even stay in the inn. All those empty rooms, all those uneaten pillow mints.",2
LORELAI,"An out of control, over the top slumber party!",2
SOOKIE,I love it!,2
RORY,Me too!,2
LORELAI,Done! Spread the word.,2
LUKE,I haven't said I'd come yet so I'm certainly not gonna suddenly become your messenger boy. Eight o'clock?,2
LORELAI,Seven.,2
LUKE,,2
LANE,Deano.,2
DEAN,Hey Lane. Are you going to this big shindig at the inn tonight?,2
LANE,"Yeah, I'm just trying to trick my mom into not going with me.",2
DEAN,How's that coming along?,2
LANE,How's that Pixies reunion coming along?,2
DEAN,"Well, I'll see you and your mom there.",2
LANE,Bye.,2
DEAN,Bye.,2
BOY,"Keep it up pal, you'll get hurt.",2
DEAN,"Whoa, hey guys! Guys, come on, break it up guys! Quit it! Hey, hold it man, get off me! Whoa, hey, get off me man, I'm not fighting you! Jess, knock it off man! What the hell is your problem?",2
JESS,Nothing.,2
DEAN,"You saw it was me, Jess. Why'd you keep punching?",2
JESS,Had momentum.,2
DEAN,Well I was trying to help you.,2
JESS,,2
LORELAI,"Hey, did Bootsy RSVP?",2
RORY,"Yeah, he's coming.",2
LORELAI,Thanks. Is he bringing anybody?,2
RORY,He's coming solo.,2
LORELAI,Okay. I'm gonna put him in room 16 with Luke.,2
RORY,You can't do that.,2
LORELAI,"Come on, let me have my fun.",2
RORY,Luke's coming with Jess.,2
LORELAI,"Well, I'll put Jess in with Miss Patty.",2
RORY,There will be no Jess left in the morning.,2
LORELAI,You stink.,2
RORY,Are these last year's cards or this year's?,2
LORELAI,"This year's, of course.",2
RORY,Don't scoff. Last year's set were still sitting here 'til Halloween.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, if that's a crack at my housekeeping skills...well then, okay.",2
RORY,Wow.,2
LORELAI,What?,2
RORY,This is one ugly looking baby. Whose baby is this?,2
LORELAI,That's your second cousin's Stan's. Poor kid.,2
RORY,"Ugh, he got Stan's everything.",2
LORELAI,That's not even the ugliest baby in the bunch.,2
RORY,You're kidding. Ouch!,2
LORELAI,That's the ugliest baby in the bunch.,2
RORY,I don't understand why people put pictures on cards.,2
LORELAI,Do they not understand we are unapologetic mockers?,2
RORY,"There's an unexplained innocence in the world. Hey, I didn't see this.",2
LORELAI,See what?,2
RORY,Dad.,2
LORELAI,Oh.,2
RORY,And the woman I'm assuming is Sherry.,2
LORELAI,"Uh, did I not show you that? Huh.",2
RORY,They've got a cute little puppy and everything.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, I must've put it in the stack and forgotten to tell you about it. Well, there it is.",2
RORY,Nice looking lady.,2
LORELAI,Mm hmm. Like a young Tammy Faye Baker.,2
RORY,But prettier than that.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, I didn't mean not pretty. Hey, question about the room list.",2
RORY,Yeah?,2
LORELAI,Room 31 - why is it empty?,2
RORY,"Oh yeah, I wanted to run an idea by you.",2
LORELAI,Run it.,2
RORY,I thought maybe a certain depressed man and his wife could stay there.,2
LORELAI,Woody and Soon-Yi?,2
RORY,Grandma and Grandpa.,2
LORELAI,"Ugh, you've got to be kidding.",2
RORY,But this could help to cheer him up.,2
LORELAI,I'll send him a Def Jam Co medy tape. That'll cheer him up.,2
RORY,It's a really good thing to do.,2
LORELAI,"We'll donate money to charity, that's a good thing too. We'll stop kicking dogs.",2
RORY,Mom.,2
LORELAI,"All right, I'll pencil them in, but they'll probably say no.",2
RORY,"Yeah, but we're not gonna hope that they say no, right?",2
LORELAI,Right.,2
RORY,"Right, because that would be really bad karma, especially on top of making fun of the ugly babies.",2
LORELAI,"Uh, I have a new year's resolution for",2
you,become more cynical and self absorbed.,2
RORY,,2
RORY,"Hey, how's Sookie doing in there?",2
LORELAI,"Ah, well, she's paper bagging it.",2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,You know...,2
RORY,"Oh, so she's right on schedule.",2
BABETTE,Hey dolls.,2
LORELAI,Hey!,2
RORY,"Hi, welcome.",2
MOREY,Are we the first ones here?,2
LORELAI,"Yes, you are.",2
BABETTE,Now don't you freak out. Morey hates being the first anywhere. He thinks it hurts his street credibility.,2
MOREY,Charlie Parker was late to everything.,2
BABETTE,Charlie Parker had more dr*gs in him than a Rite-Aid. Forget Charlie Parker.,2
RORY,You guys are in room 8. It's all ready for you.,2
BABETTE,"Thanks, doll. C'mon Morey. We can be late for dinner if it'll make you feel better.",2
MOREY,A little.,2
BABETTE,Yeah.,2
LANE,Hey!,2
RORY,,2
KIM,Lane!,2
LANE,My wedding night's gonna be very interesting.,2
RORY,,2
KIM,"Thank you. Hello Lorelai, thank you for inviting us.",2
LORELAI,,2
KIM,This is my stuff. Don't need any more stuff. People have too much stuff.,2
LORELAI,You know you're right. People have too much stuff. Absolutely.,2
RORY,Says the woman with 64 pairs of shoes.,2
LORELAI,Thus proving my point. What is Paris doing here?,2
RORY,She had to bring me the newspaper stuff tonight. She just couldn't wait.,2
LORELAI,"A robot, she's a robot. Hi!",2
RORY,Hey.,2
PARIS,So here are the materials in the double issue. Some of the articles are gonna need complete rewrites.,2
RORY,Drag.,2
PARIS,Madeline's 500 words on test anxiety spends 400 of them arguing that stretch corduroy is the best material for low-rise jeans.,2
RORY,"Well, let's see. Corduroy is a fabric, and the fabric of society is weakened when students ",2
PARIS,You can't get there.,2
RORY,"Yeah, it doesn't look like it. I'll get right on this tomorrow.",2
PARIS,What about tonight?,2
RORY,I'm busy tonight.,2
PARIS,Doing what?,2
RORY,"Well, this.",2
PARIS,Oh. What is this?,2
RORY,It's kind of a big dinner party.,2
PARIS,"Oh. Okay, well, I'll get out of your way. Call if you need to talk things through, and oh - she uses the Prince version of writing. A letter U for you and a picture of an eye for an I.",2
RORY,Wow.,2
PARIS,Yeah.,2
RORY,"Hey Paris, do you have anything going on tonight?",2
PARIS,What's that supposed to mean?,2
RORY,"It's supposed to mean, do you have anything going on tonight?",2
PARIS,"Well, my parents are out of town, so my Portuguese nanny will make dinner and then I'll either get back to reading the Iliad or we'll play Monopoly. I crush her every time.",2
RORY,"Well I was just thinking, maybe you want to stay for dinner?",2
PARIS,Here?,2
RORY,"Yeah. We have a ton of food, and it's like a whole big show and everything, and if you're not doing anything ",2
PARIS,Rereading the Iliad a third time is not not doing anything. I'm not pathetic.,2
RORY,"I know you're not. I just thought it might be fun, that's all.",2
PARIS,"Well, I'll have to make a call.",2
RORY,"Good, make it.",2
PARIS,I just have to let Nanny know. Nanny? É Paris. Vou jantar com Rory hoje à noite. Eu telefono no caminho de casa. Tchau.,2
DEAN,Hey.,2
RORY,"Hello there. Hey Clara. Nice, is that a Stella McCartney?",2
CLARA,It's a Wal-Mart.,2
RORY,"Well, it's very pretty.",2
CLARA,My mom bought it for tonight.,2
RORY,She's got good taste.,2
DEAN,I didn't know he was coming.,2
RORY,Who?,2
DEAN,Jess.,2
RORY,Yeah. Is that a problem?,2
DEAN,Not really.,2
RORY,Dean.,2
DEAN,"It's just that, he got into this fight with this guy at school, and when I broke it up he started in on me.",2
RORY,He hit you?,2
DEAN,He tried.,2
RORY,Why would he do that?,2
DEAN,,2
SOOKIE,"No! It tastes too twentieth century guys. It's gotta shout Washington Irving, not Irving my accountant. It needs something, help me. What is it?",2
CHEF,Uhh ,2
LORELAI,How's it going? AGH!,2
SOOKIE,What?,2
LORELAI,"Ooh! Ew, Rune naked, naked Rune.",2
SOOKIE,Ahh!,2
RUNE,These stupid pants won't go past my thighs.,2
LORELAI,Why are you dressing in here?,2
RUNE,The bathrooms are full and the lousy madrigal singers are bull guarding the supply closet so this is the only place.,2
SOOKIE,They're too small.,2
RUNE,My thighs are too big.,2
LORELAI,"Ahh! Rune, yes, but in lieu of coming up with something that would immediately reduce the size of your thighs, why don't we get you a bigger pair of pants?",2
SOOKIE,And a different place to dress.,2
LORELAI,Definitely.,2
RUNE,"Well, can you get me the supply closet?",2
LORELAI,We'll take it by force if we have to. Go. Ah. Is everything under control?,2
SOOKIE,"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ye...no. This needs something and I cannot think of what it is. It's that tart, kind of spicy, white. . .salt! The word is salt!",2
LORELAI,You forgot the word for salt?,2
SOOKIE,Everything's under control.,2
LORELAI,Good.,2
SOOKIE,"Absolutely, one hundred percent.",2
LORELAI,You're exuding confidence. Have the oxygen ready.,2
SOOKIE,,2
LORELAI,They're here.,2
RORY,Who?,2
LORELAI,The Joy-less Luck Club.,2
RICHARD,Hello girls. You look particularly lovely tonight.,2
RORY,Thanks Grandpa.,2
LORELAI,Thanks Dad. You guys look nice yourselves.,2
EMILY,Seems like the occasion called for it.,2
RICHARD,The air seems crisper here than Hartford. It's wonderful.,2
LORELAI,"Hey Dad, you didn't grab the wrong prescription bottle earlier today, did you?",2
RICHARD,What?,2
RORY,Nothing.,2
EMILY,I think she was making one of her funny jokes.,2
RICHARD,"Oh, went straight over my head.",2
LORELAI,Let me get someone to help you with your bags.,2
RICHARD,"No, no, I've got them. Just point me to the room.",2
RORY,"You guys are in room 31, best room in the place.",2
RICHARD,"Oh, anything's fine. I'll, uh, see you in a bit.",2
LORELAI,What got into him?,2
RORY,He's totally different.,2
EMILY,I know. He's been that way for two days. I have no idea why but I'm taking the credit.,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,"Hey everybody, will you gather round? Everyone, everyone! First of all, I want to welcome you to the first annual and probably never ever to be held again because Sookie's on the verge of a nervous breakdown Bracebridge Dinner.",2
SOOKIE,"I'm fine, everything's fine.",2
LORELAI,"I also want to thank Mother Nature for snowing in the Trelling Paper Company in Chicago so I can throw this great party for all my friends instead. It's a very special night. And so, since I don't get to eat unbelievably strange food with my friends everyday, I have arranged a little surprise. Outside, as we speak, is a line of horse drawn sleighs and everybody gets a ride. So, uh, line up and keep it orderly. There's two per sleigh and no cutting in front of each other - that goes for everyone. Except me, 'cause I'll be damned if I'm gonna miss a ride in a horse drawn sleigh. Come on.",2
LUKE,You gonna go?,2
JESS,I think I'll wait for the clog dancing.,2
DEAN,"Hey, hey, don't move.",2
CLARA,But we're gonna miss all the good horses!,2
RORY,Who is this brazen woman competing for your attention?,2
CLARA,Come on!,2
DEAN,"Uh, I guess I'm spoken for.",2
RORY,,2
BOOTSY,You see the horses?,2
LUKE,"You mean the ones three feet from my face? Yeah, I saw 'em.",2
BOOTSY,I spent a summer training horses in Montana.,2
LUKE,You get kicked in the head a lot?,2
BOOTSY,Just the once.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, you in the belt - get in.",2
LUKE,"What? Oh, no, I was just sort of checking things out.",2
LORELAI,Come on. We can pull a Ben Hur and take down Taylor's sleigh.,2
LUKE,"I don't know, I...",2
LORELAI,"Aww, come on Luke. I can't be all school marm-y and ride by myself. Please?",2
LUKE,"Well, okay.",2
LORELAI,"Giddy up. Uh! The horses heard me, I speak horse language! I'm Dr. Dolittle!",2
LUKE,"Plus, I think the driver of the sleigh heard you.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah.",2
LUKE,"I gotta say, sleigh ride's a little much, but these horses are really beautiful.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, especially from this angle.",2
LUKE,Not just from this angle.,2
LORELAI,"Oh seriously, don't backtrack. Horse has got a nice butt there.",2
LUKE,It's not what I'm saying.,2
LORELAI,Nice firm hiney.,2
LUKE,Stop talking about the horse's hiney.,2
LORELAI,"God, the town looks beautiful.",2
LUKE,Same as always.,2
LORELAI,"No, it's always different his time of year. It's magical.",2
LUKE,"If you say so, sure. Oh look, there's the magical plumbing supply store where I bought a magical float for my toilet last week.",2
LORELAI,You disappoint me.,2
LUKE,Oh look. There's the magical Luke's Diner right underneath the apartment that Jess magically lit by leaving every stinkin' light on.,2
LORELAI,How's it going with you guys?,2
LUKE,Me and Jess? Great.,2
LORELAI,Great? Really?,2
LUKE,Really.,2
LORELAI,"Well, good.",2
LUKE,"It is good. I mean, it was hard at first, seemed impossible, you know, but I've learned a lot these past couple months.",2
LORELAI,Like?,2
LUKE,Like last week I discovered the secret of parenting.,2
LORELAI,You did?,2
LUKE,Yup.,2
LORELAI,The secret of parenting?,2
LUKE,The secret of parenting.,2
LORELAI,When last week? Last Tuesday?,2
LUKE,I don't know the exact day.,2
LORELAI,"Tuesday at 5:15, is that when you discovered the secret of parenting?",2
LUKE,Don't mock.,2
LORELAI,"Well, tell me. What is. . . oh wait, it's a secret, you can't tell me.",2
LUKE,"No, I'll tell you. You visualize the reality you want.",2
LORELAI,You visualize the reality you want.,2
LUKE,"And then if necessary, you lie to bring it about.",2
LORELAI,That is so much worse than I was expecting.,2
LUKE,You never lied to your kid?,2
LORELAI,"Ahh, to save her from great physical pain, yes. When she was little and she would play in the kitchen, I told her that the burners were the devil's hands, but I would say it in a really scary evangelist voice, you know, 'Don't touch the devil's hands!' She still doesn't go near the stove.",2
LUKE,"Yes, exactly. You told a little white lie for your kid's protection, very similar to what I've done.",2
LORELAI,Which was?,2
LUKE,"Well, you know the winter break is coming up?",2
LORELAI,Yes I do.,2
LUKE,"Okay, well that means Jess has some time off from school. His mom knew that and she never called.",2
LORELAI,"Ugh, it makes me sick",2
LUKE,"So I decided just to keep Jess with me, and I told him that his mom wanted him to come home but I thought since he just got there and was still adjusting that I thought he should stay, and his mom was really upset but I insisted. He bought it hook, line and sinker. Saved him a lot of hurt.",2
LORELAI,He didn't buy it.,2
LUKE,What? Of course he did.,2
LORELAI,He knows.,2
EMILY,I wish Lorelai had warned us about this.,2
RICHARD,What? This is wonderful..,2
EMILY,It's wreaking havoc with my hair.,2
RICHARD,"Oh this is not bad for your hair, compared to the other thing.",2
EMILY,"What other thing? Richard, stop it! Stop it! Suddenly you're two years old.",2
RICHARD,"Oh, I'm just having fun.",2
EMILY,I'm not complaining.,2
RICHARD,This is fun too. This is like a roller coaster.,2
EMILY,A little.,2
RICHARD,"Say, when was the last time we were on a roller coaster?",2
EMILY,Never.,2
RICHARD,Didn't we ever go to Coney Island?,2
EMILY,That must've been your other wife.,2
RICHARD,"Gosh, I used to love it when I was a kid. They were a lot faster then too.",2
EMILY,And less safe.,2
RICHARD,We should go on one.,2
EMILY,What?,2
RICHARD,A fast one.,2
EMILY,Fine. You go and I'll wait and hold your cotton candy for you.,2
RICHARD,You are going.,2
EMILY,It would take a whole day.,2
RICHARD,You are going.,2
EMILY,I'd be scared.,2
RICHARD,I'll hold your hand.,2
EMILY,Fine. We'll go on a roller coaster.,2
RICHARD,Good.,2
EMILY,Now where is this roller coaster we're going on?,2
RICHARD,I'm not sure. I'll get Rory to look it up on the Internet for us.,2
DRIVERory,That it miss?,2
RORY,I guess I'm alone.,2
RORY,What are you doing?,2
JESS,"Well, I heard it was two to a sleigh - no more, no less. You were breaking the rules.",2
RORY,You could've hurt yourself.,2
JESS,I live on the edge. I can jump out if you want.,2
RORY,Doesn't matter to me.,2
JESS,Are you mad at me or something?,2
RORY,What do you think?,2
JESS,I can't read your mind.,2
RORY,You got into a fight with Dean.,2
JESS,Dean?,2
RORY,My boyfriend.,2
JESS,Ah. He's still your boyfriend?,2
RORY,"Okay, you can jump out now.",2
JESS,I wasn't fighting him. I was fighting someone else. He jumped in on his own.,2
RORY,He was trying to help you.,2
JESS,"Oh, he should go into government service if he's so interested in helping people. But me, he can stop worrying about.",2
RORY,Why were you fighting in the first place?,2
JESS,'Cause Chuck Presby's a jerk.,2
RORY,You were fighting Chuck Presby?,2
JESS,Yeah.,2
RORY,"Oh, he is a jerk.",2
JESS,This whole town is weird and full of jerks.,2
RORY,Then why are you still here?,2
JESS,What do you mean?,2
RORY,"I mean, school's out and you don't like it here, so why don't you just go home?",2
JESS,My mom didn't want me to.,2
RORY,I don't believe that.,2
JESS,"That's your right, I guess.",2
RORY,Did Luke say she didn't want you to?,2
JESS,Luke told me it was his idea that I should stay. It wasn't his idea. That's good.,2
RORY,What?,2
JESS,"Your snowman. Snowwoman, actually.",2
RORY,You know which one is ours?,2
JESS,It definitely has the most personality. Kind of looks like Bjork.,2
RORY,That's what we were going for.,2
JESS,Yeah?,2
RORY,But everyone thinks the one on the end is gonna be the winner.,2
JESS,Really? It's so overdone.,2
RORY,I agree.,2
JESS,You should win.,2
RORY,No argument.,2
JESS,"Hey, what do you and Dean talk about?",2
RORY,What?,2
JESS,"I mean, does he know Bjork?",2
RORY,I've played him some stuff.,2
JESS,Hm. So you got a teacher-student thing going?,2
RORY,Stop.,2
JESS,"No, really, I'm curious. What do you guys talk about?",2
RORY,Everything.,2
JESS,Like?,2
RORY,"Just everything, tons of stuff, whatever.",2
JESS,"It's just in the brief non-pugilistic time I've spent with him in class, he just doesn't seem like your kind of guy.",2
RORY,"Well, he is my kind of guy. He's exactly my kind of guy.",2
JESS,Okay. I guess I don't know him that well.,2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,"Quiet please, everybody. Before the, uh, button popping and the bloating can commence, say cheese.",2
EVERYONE,Cheese!,2
LORELAI,"Uh, now, ladies and gentlemen, damen und herren, um, the moment you've been waiting for, I give you the Bracebridge Dinner.",2
SOOKIE,"Whoa, whoa, hold it. We just need a quick minute, please.",2
LORELAI,Which will be starting in one quick minute.,2
BOOTSY,You ever think about that? You can't have a quick minute because it's always sixty seconds.,2
LUKE,,2
PATTY,"Lorelai darling, who is the silver fox with the tight kneesocks?",2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,"Oh, well the uniform is interesting.",2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,"What? Oh, you joke? Was that a joke?",2
RICHARD,"Lorelai, this is just beautiful. It's like something out of Architectural Digest. You should be very proud.",2
LORELAI,Thanks Dad.,2
EMILY,Your dress needs pressing.,2
LORELAI,Thanks Mom.,2
LORELAI,Your pod Grandpa is still happy as a clam.,2
RORY,"See, I told you this would be good for him.",2
LORELAI,"When you're right, you're right.",2
RUNE,"Welcome Lords and Ladies. I call upon these sprightly horns to commence our proceedings. Hey Chuck Mangione, you wanna back up a step?",2
LORELAI,And we're off.,2
RUNE,"And now, fair people, I present my Lord and Master, the honorable Squire Bracebridge.",2
JACKSON,Lo! Now has come our joyfullest feast. Let every man be jolly.,2
JESS,We should've eaten before we came.,2
LUKE,Shh! And yeah.,2
JACKSON,"Humble servant, bring us the first course to dine with pleasure. Mmm, methinks it be a butternut squash soup.",2
RUNE,"Ah, methinks you're right Squire Bracebridge, thus and verily.",2
JACKSON,And verily thus.,2
LORELAI,They're the Old England Abbot and Costello.,2
JACKSON,"'Tis perfection, but extremely hot.",2
RUNE,"My Lord, do you need aid? Wouldst thou have thee ice thy tongue?",2
JACKSON,"Ah nay, Rune, nay. To the guests thou shall serve the soup!",2
JESS,What's the white stuff?,2
LUKE,I think it's cheese - or cream.,2
JESS,And the green stuff?,2
LUKE,,2
KIM,No one says grace?,2
LANE,,2
KIM,Did you say silent grace?,2
BABETTE,Good one!,2
KIRK,Soup for mi'ladies?,2
RORY,"Why thank you, kind sir.",2
LORELAI,"Hey Kirk, nice blouse.",2
RORY,Don't let her make fun of you Kirk. You look great.,2
KIRK,"Soup with garlands, gay and rosemary.",2
LORELAI,"You're gonna stay in character no matter what, huh?",2
KIRK,"'Tis hot, so proceed daintily.",2
LORELAI,"Hey, did you ever see that I Love Lucy where she goes to Buckingham Palace?",2
RORY,Mom.,2
LORELAI,She tries to get the palace guard to break character. That was a funny one.,2
KIRK,'Tis foreign to me good lady.,2
RORY,"Hang in there, Kirk.",2
LORELAI,"Those ones where she was in Europe, hands down, those were the best!",2
KIRK,"No way, the Hollywood ones!",2
LORELAI,Ha!,2
KIRK,Damn!,2
RORY,I was rooting for you boy.,2
RUNE,"My Lord, shall dessert be served?",2
JACKSON,"Anon, humble servant.",2
CLARA,Can I eat my dessert with the horses?,2
DEAN,"Sure, uh, but put your coat on.",2
CLARA,Are you okay?,2
BOOTSY,I guess so. I've lost track of how many beers I've had.,2
CLARA,Seven.,2
LORELAI,"Hey Paris, how's it going?",2
PARIS,"Fine, good, thanks for having me.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, it was our pleasure.",2
PARIS,Did you notice the anachronisms?,2
LORELAI,The what?,2
PARIS,"The period discrepancies. They were pretty blatant. I mean, forget that the nineteenth century didn't include recessed lighting or the Fossil watch that your server was wearing, but water in that period would not have been served with cubed ice.",2
LORELAI,Right.,2
PARIS,"And your servers are wearing nylon blend shirts, and nylon was invented by a scientist at Dupont in the 1920's. It shattered the illusion.",2
LORELAI,Floggings will be administered.,2
RICHARD,"So there we are, it's a beautiful moonlit Prague night, and we're strolling across the Charles Bridge when we come ac ross this group of kids blasting this song by that. . .oh, that awful woman. Who is she? The tall bony one, married to the deceased mustachioed congressman.",2
RORY,Cher?,2
EMILY,That's the one!,2
LORELAI,The year of 'Do you believe in life after love?',2
RORY,A difficult time for all of us.,2
MICHELorelai,I like that song.,2
RICHARD,"Well, I was appalled. Prague has played host to some of the greatest composers in history. Mozart named a symphony after it, for heaven's sake. So what did I do?",2
EMILY,I have tried so hard to forget this.,2
RICHARD,I stood beside them and their boombox and I hummed Mozart's Prague Symphony as loud as I could.,2
LORELAI,A bizarro Battle of the Bands.,2
TAYLORory,And did it work?,2
RICHARD,"Well, they quickly packed up and went their way.",2
EMILY,But then he kept on hummin g the Mozart. He wouldn't stop.,2
RICHARD,"Well, at that point I was hoping for some gullible tourists to drop money at my feet.",2
EMILY,And two of them did.,2
RICHARD,And I kept it!,2
TAYLORory,"You know, this might be the most interesting conversation I've ever had with an insurance man.",2
RICHARD,"Aww, I'm hurt.",2
TAYLORory,I'm sorry Richard. What I meant was that ,2
RICHARD,"No, what you meant was that people in the insurance industry are drones. Well I agree. They are a dull, dull lot, and I am glad to be rid of them.",2
LORELAI,Rid of them?,2
TAYLORory,"Oh, are you retired Richard?",2
RICHARD,"Well, uh ",2
EMILY,Of course he's not. Richard? Richard?,2
RICHARD,,2
LORELAI,"Ah, it's always nice to end a big festive meal with a big festive pall hanging over the room.",2
RORY,Most people didn't notice anything.,2
LORELAI,I guess. Bootsy singing Hotel California accompanied by spoons drew people's attention away.,2
RORY,Did Grandma and Grandpa say a word to each other the rest of the night?,2
LORELAI,No.,2
RORY,Why didn't he tell anyone?,2
LORELAI,"I'm sorry, are you asking me to interpret my parents' motives?",2
RORY,My mistake. So which bed do you want?,2
LORELAI,Take the one by the window.,2
RORY,Okay. Mom!,2
LORELAI,What honey?,2
RORY,You put the picture of the ugly baby in my bed?,2
LORELAI,"I didn't, I swear. That ugly baby is stalking us. Run away!",2
RORY,"Poor baby, it's not his fault.",2
LORELAI,I think it's a she.,2
RORY,"Poor baby, you picked the wrong parents. Hey, have you heard from Dad recently?",2
LORELAI,What dad - your dad?,2
RORY,"Yeah, my dad.",2
LORELAI,Why?,2
RORY,"Because he's my dad, and he usually checks in this time of year and he hasn't checked in yet. I mean, I know he's probably busy with Sherry and the new apartment and...what?",2
LORELAI,There may have been a call.,2
RORY,There may have been? You don't remember?,2
LORELAI,"Well things have been so hectic, you know, with the Bracebridge Dinner, and um, building a snowwoman, and planning the ugly baby gag, that took time.",2
RORY,Mom?,2
LORELAI,"Yes, he called! He called, he called, he called and invited you, and it's not too late to go. He called and invited you, so there you go. I'm sorry I didn't tell you, so there.",2
RORY,He invited me over?,2
LORELAI,"Yes, are you deaf?",2
RORY,"No, I'm just trying to separate the gist from the ubububububah.",2
LORELAI,"Well, the gist is he invited you, okay?",2
RORY,Why didn't he invite me himself?,2
LORELAI,Because he's pretending to be considerate by running it past me first.,2
RORY,"Was he maybe not pretending to be considerate, and actually being considerate?",2
LORELAI,Maybe. But I wouldn't put it past him to be inconsiderate. The guy doesn't have the greatest track record.,2
RORY,"Why didn't you tell me this? He's probably waiting for my answer, and holding off making plans.",2
LORELAI,"Because I have dibs on this time of year with you, not him! Me! And yes, he acknowledged that, and that was cool and all, but still - it stinks! Because he put me in a very difficult position because we were supposed to watch a lot of movies and make fun of Godfather 3, and the thing that I really, really hate about this is is the idea of you not hanging out with me because you're hanging out there with your stupid stepmother.",2
RORY,You're calling Sherry my stepmother?,2
LORELAI,"Well, she practically is.",2
RORY,You're wigging.,2
LORELAI,There is something wrong with that woman.,2
RORY,You don't even know her.,2
LORELAI,You think I'm overreacting?,2
RORY,I think you're jealous of Sherry.,2
LORELAI,"Ha, I'm not jealous of Sherry.",2
RORY,But I understand - your territory has been threatened.,2
LORELAI,Excuse me?,2
RORY,"But relax, there are ways to work through situations like this - compromises can be struck.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, what are you saying?",2
RORY,"Well, you know, I can still call you Mom, and I'll call her Mommy Sherry.",2
LORELAI,Don't be mean.,2
RORY,"And we can split up holidays evenly. Like, I'll be with you on Labor Day ",2
LORELAI,Okay.,2
RORY,  her on Memorial Day.,2
LORELAI,Enough.,2
RORY,"I'll have to find out about her religion though to see how Chanukah will factor into this, unless you want to convert to Judaism and then take over Chanukah for yourself.",2
LORELAI,I get the point. I overreacted. Please stop.,2
RORY,You totally overreacted. God.,2
LORELAI,So do you think you're gonna go and stay with them?,2
RORY,I'll have to think about it.,2
LORELAI,Do you have to think about it because you know that it's k*lling me not to know whether you're going or not and you want to t*rture me like that?,2
RORY,"Nope, I just don't know if I want to do it.",2
LORELAI,Oh.,2
RORY,It was nice of him to ask though.,2
LORELAI,It was very nice.,2
RORY,'Cause we are rooting for Dad.,2
LORELAI,We are rooting for him. It was a very nice thing that Christopher offered. I was being alittle possessive.,2
RORY,And insanely jealous of his pretty girlfriend.,2
LORELAI,"Well, I wanna know if she's good enough for him.",2
RORY,Me too.,2
LORELAI,So there was an altruistic streak to my madness.,2
RORY,We'll go with that.,2
EMILY,I need a new room.,2
LORELAI,What?,2
EMILY,I can't stay in that room.,2
LORELAI,"There are no other rooms, Mom.",2
EMILY,"Well, then I'll go home.",2
RORY,"Grandma, it's late.",2
LORELAI,"And pitch black, and the roads are icy. You can't be driving.",2
EMILY,"Well, I'm not going back to that room.",2
LORELAI,I'm guessing you and Dad had it out about the job thing?,2
EMILY,"We haven't even spoken since dinner. I'm so upset, I wouldn't know where to begin. And I couldn't take being around him anymore. What he did is inexcusable. Not letting me know he left his job - as if it didn't affect me?",2
LORELAI,"Aw mom, try to calm down. Here, take this bed, and Rory and I will share.",2
EMILY,I'm just a burden.,2
LORELAI,"You're not a burden, Mom.",2
EMILY,"Well, okay, thank you. Can I use the mirror in the bathroom for a second?",2
LORELAI,"Yes, I'll use the one out here.",2
RORY,Wow.,2
LORELAI,What?,2
RORY,Behold my future.,2
EMILY,How do you turn out the light?,2
LORELAI,I'll get it.,2
EMILY,I still can't believe it.,2
LORELAI,Try to relax Mom.,2
EMILY,I hope he doesn't sleep because I surely won't.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, Mom.",2
EMILY,These slippers you have here are hardly one size fits all. They're too big.,2
LORELAI,Goodnight.,2
EMILY,It was so irresponsible.,2
LORELAI,Maybe he had no choice.,2
EMILY,Of course he had a choice. Go to sleep Lorelai.,2
LORELAI,"That job was k*lling him, Mom. It was k*lling him.",2
EMILY,I'm going for a little walk.,2
RORY,"Grandma, it's late.",2
EMILY,I'm not tired.,2
LORELAI,,2
EMILY,I didn't know you were here.,2
RICHARD,"Emily, don't go.",2
EMILY,I'm very tired.,2
RICHARD,"I want to talk to you, please. I don't need to remind you about how I've been feeling at work, and my frustration just built to the point where again, you know this. So, I arranged to meet the CEO yesterday just to talk about the situation and about the rumors I'd heard floating around. So I met with Floyd. We shook hands, had coffee, then I started telling him about how unhappy I'd become. I detailed all my years with the company, all the travel I'd done, all the weekends I put in, the sacrifices I'd made, including time w ith my family, for the firm. And the more I talked, the angrier I became, and then suddenly I heard myself resign, just like that. Floyd was stunned. I'd never seen Floyd stunned. I enjoyed seeing Floyd stunned. So I finished my coffee and I walked out of that office, and I couldn't believe what I'd just done. I'd resigned, quit. I believe I even used a little profanity in the process. But you know what Emily? I was thrilled, elated, a giant weight had been lifted off my chest. I noticed Floyd's secretary staring at me, and I realized it was because I was smiling. Well, nobody had seen me smile there in a very long time. I was. . .I was happy.",2
EMILY,And you chose not to tell me? Your own wife.,2
RICHARD,"Oh Emily, I know I've done nothing but disappoint you these past few months, what withhow isolated I've become an d all the social engagements I've made you cancel, and all the friendships I've jeopardized. And you like order, you like lists, you like to know where you're going or what's coming. You like all things planned. And then suddenly I impulsively unplan our entire future in one fail swoop. Well, I couldn't face disappointing you again. I couldn't face telling you that I'd spoiled the plan. Not now, not at this time of year. I didn't want to fight, I didn't want to worry, I just wanted to keep being happy. I'm very, very sorry. Anyhow, um, I've been sitting here going over our financial situation. Now, um, we still have all of our retirement accounts, and our medical coverage is all there, By quitting though, we do forgo some of my pension and some stock options. Not a terribly significant amount, but an amount all the same.",2
EMILY,,2
RORY,See ya Bootsy.,2
BOOTSY,"See ya, thanks. By the way, last night did I sing Hotel California?",2
RORY,From beginning to end.,2
LORELAI,While banging spoons on your head.,2
BOOTSY,Well that explains the lumps.,2

EMILY,Could you be any cruder?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, I can be cruder. Hey mom, did you get la ",2

JACKSON,"Oh, you're welcome. Hey, uh, by the way, last night when Bootsy was singing Hotel California and banging spoons on his head, did I ",2
LORELAI,Lift up your shirt and play drums on your stomach? Yes you did.,2
JACKSON,Oh boy.,2
RORY,You kept a good beat.,2
SOOKIE,"Yeah, 'cause God knows if the beat was off, you'd have embarrassed yourself.",2
CLARA,Thanks Rory.,2
RORY,"Clara, I'm glad you came.",2

DEAN,"Aw, come on.",2

RORY,Are we coming to get our bags later?,2
LORELAI,Why?,2
RORY,Because we're walking home. I don't want to carry 'em.,2

RORY,How did I get a higher score in math?,2
LORELAI,Who cares?,2
RORY,But I'm stronger in verbal. Verbal is my thing.,2
LORELAI,"No, verbal's my thing.",2
RORY,Maybe I didn't study hard enough. Maybe I got cocky.,2
LORELAI,Maybe you need a major mud bath/salt glow/chill pill combo.,2
RORY,I'm just saying. . .,2
LORELAI,"Rory, you got a great score.",2
RORY,Yeah but. . .,2
LORELAI,"No, a great score.",2

RORY,Can I invite Lane?,2
LORELAI,Absolutely.,2
RORY,Okay. I hope she gets this in time. She's been kind of hard to reach lately.,2

LORELAI,"Yes. I am Magenta, Rory usually opts for Janet, and I had a thought.",2
LUKE,Oh yeah?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah. I was thinking that you could put on some fishnet stockings, a leather teddy, some platform boots, and go with us as Dr. Frank-N-Furter.",2
LUKE,"Hmm. Well, now that is a thought.",2
LORELAI,You'll also need some gloves and a wig.,2
LUKE,"Gloves, wigs, got it.",2
LORELAI,I'll do your makeup.,2

RORY,So do you think the porch is falling apart or do you just weigh a ton?,2
LORELAI,"The porch is fine. It just has a little extra ventilation in it now, that's all.",2
RORY,The wood is old and rotting.,2
LORELAI,"The wood is not old and rotting, it is strong and sprightly and will be with us for a long, long time to come.",2
RORY,So you do weigh a ton?,2
KIRK,"Well, I checked under the entire house.",2
LORELAI,And?,2
KIRK,You have termites.,2
LORELAI,What?,2
KIRK,"Tens of thousands of them. Subterranean, dry wood, the whole gamut.",2
RORY,Gross.,2
KIRK,Four of them crawled up my noise.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, Kirk.",2
KIRK,It happens all the time w hen you're upside down. To them the nostril looks just like another hollow passage in the wood. They're not too bright.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, so, we have termites. So what do we - um, don't you want to come inside Kirk?",2
KIRK,"Actually, I would prefer to discuss this outside.",2
LORELAI,,2
KIRK,"Okay, let's get down to it. From what I've just witnessed, your house is a bug-infested smorgasbord. Are those for me?",2
ORY,"Oh, yeah.",2
KIRK,Thanks.,2
LORELAI,But what do we do?,2
KIRK,"Well. . .uh, if you don't mind, I'd prefer to discuss this on the lawn.",2
LORELAI,Why?,2
KIRK,Because this porch could give out on us at any minute.,2
LORELAI,"Kirk, that's crazy. Kirk, stop, the porch is fine.",2
RORY,Your foot went through it this morning.,2
LORELAI,"That was different, that wood was old.",2
RORY,What happened to sprightly?,2
LORELAI,"Kirk, what are you doing?",2
KIRK,"Just making sure that if the roof comes down, the debris can't ricochet over here and take me out.",2
LORELAI,"Honey, in five more minutes, it won't need to.",2
KIRK,What?,2
LORELAI,"Kirk, please, talk to me ab out the termites. What do I have to do, tent the place?",2
KIRK,"To start with, yes.",2
RORY,To start with?,2
LORELAI,What does that mean?,2
KIRK,It means they've done some serious damage under there. They've eaten through the wooden joists. Your foundation has completely lost its structural integrity.,2
RORY,"Mom, our house is falling down.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, what do I have to do to fix this?",2
KIRK,"You'd have to jack the house up, rebuild the jousts, and repair the weakened parts of the foundation.",2
LORELAI,"All for the low, low price of?",2
KIRK,"Well, I haven't done the exact estimate, but I'd say somewhere in the neighborhood of fifteen thousand dollars.",2
LORELAI,Tell it to move to another neighborhood.,2
KIRK,I'm sorry?,2
LORELAI,Fifteen thousand dollars?,2
RORY,We're never eating again.,2
LORELAI,I don't have fifteen thousand dollars. I've never had fifteen thousand dollars. I'm trying to picture fifteen thousand dollars - I can't! That's how unfamiliar fifteen thousand dollars and I are with each other!,2
KIRK,"Well, maybe you can just fix part of the house. Fix the part you like.",2
LORELAI,We like the entire house Kirk.,2
KIRK,Really? Even that kitchen?,2
LORELAI,Thanks for coming over Kirk.,2
KIRK,So what are you gonna do?,2
LORELAI,I don't know yet.,2
KIRK,"Oh, 'cause you don't wanna wait too long to address this.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, I get that Kirk.",2
KIRK,You might wanna get the dishes out of there.,2
LORELAI,Good tip.,2
KIRK,Thanks for the waffles.,2
LORELAI,Thanks for the horrifying news.,2
KIRK,Any time.,2
LORELAI,Look at it this way. The day's all uphill from here.,2

MADELINE,Take them.,2
PARIS,"So, I got my scores back today too.",2
MADELINE,Oh yeah?,2
PARIS,"This morning. I just came downstairs and there they were, just sitting on the table. Boy, was I nervous, just imagining what I got. But then I realized that I'd have to open them eventually, and so I did. And was I surprised by what I found. Could've knocked me over with a feather. Yup, I was just that surprised.",2
RORY,"So, what did you get?",2

RORY,You don't.,2
PARIS,Right. So are you?,2
RORY,Am I what?,2
PARIS,Are you one of those people who gets pretty happy looking at a sunset?,2

RORY,What's going on?,2
LORELAI,I can hear them chewing.,2

LORELAI,"The termites. I hear them. They're everywhere, nibbling and eating and swallowing.",2
RORY,You're insane.,2
LORELAI,I can't sleep here.,2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,"No, we have to go to Sookie's.",2
RORY,You're kidding right?,2
LORELAI,Unh uh.,2
RORY,It's eleven o'clock at night.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, well, here. But somewhere in the world it's still Miller time.",2
RORY,"Mom, you're wigging. Go put on some imaginary earplugs to drown out the imaginary termite sounds and go back to sleep.",2
LORELAI,But -.,2
RORY,Bed.,2
LORELAI,But -.,2
RORY,Now.,2

LORELAI,"Ugh, I know, with their creepy little fangy teeth and their tail things and their pointy tentacles.",2
RORY,"You have no idea what a termite looks like, do you?",2
LORELAI,"Hey, unless they're wearing a foundation repair guy T-shirt, I don't really care.",2
RORY,Are you sure Sookie was up?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, she answered the phone.",2
RORY,After how many rings?,2
LORELAI,"I don't know, twenty or thirty.",2
RORY,"Mom, she was sleeping.",2
LORELAI,"No, no, she's just deaf in one ear.",2
RORY,Since when?,2
LORELAI,"Now, apparently.",2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,"Well, you would have to be deaf in one ear not to hear the phone ring twenty or thirty times.",2
SOOKIE,"They're they are, my little termite whisperers.",2
LORELAI,"Hey Sookie, sorry to call so late.",2
RORY,And so incessantly.,2
LORELAI,"Well I'm sorry, they were getting organized. I heard one of them yell charge.",2
RORY,We will make this up to you Sookie.,2
SOOKIE,What are you talking about? This is great. It'll be like a slumber party.,2
RORY,Are you sure?,2
SOOKIE,"Absolutely. We can raid the fridge. We can make a nice avocado- mango face mask. Get out the tarot cards, tell fortunes, play Twister, make a Häagen-Dazs chocolate chocolate chip ice cream mil kshake, and we'll watch Purple Rain. . .",2
LORELAI,"Sookie, it's midnight.",2
SOOKIE,"Okay, let's go straight for the milkshakes.",2
LORELAI,Good thinking.,2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,"Sookie, I really appreciate you letting us crash here tonight. It was so creepy just lying there listening to a thousand tiny little insects just mocking me. 'Ha ha, we're eating your house, try and stop us.'",2
SOOKIE,When are you going to tent?,2
LORELAI,Next week.,2
SOOKIE,"Ugh, that sucks.",2
LORELAI,Two thousand dollars.,2
SOOKIE,That sucks.,2
LORELAI,"And after the two thousand dollar circus tent fiasco, I have to find another fifteen thousand dollars to keep my house from falling down.",2
SOOKIE,Aw honey.,2
LORELAI,I like that house.,2
SOOKIE,I know you do.,2
LORELAI,I don't want it to fall down.,2
SOOKIE,I know you don't.,2
LORELAI,"So anyway, I called the bank today.",2
SOOKIE,How did that go?,2
LORELAI,"Well, it - wait, yeah, oh, what's that? Yeah, they're still laughing.",2
SOOKIE,What?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, they passed the phone around, made me ask everyone in the place.",2
SOOKIE,"That is terrible! Ugh, completely heartless.",2
LORELAI,"According to the jolly bankers, I'm worth nothing.",2
SOOKIE,There still has to be something you can do.,2
LORELAI,I was thinking about opening a Coyote Ugly lemonade stand.,2
SOOKIE,Interesting.,2
RORY,What's interesting?,2
LORELAI,"Mm, nothing, nothing. Just that your mom is apparently one of the biggest losers in Stars Hollow.",2
RORY,"Okay, continue.",2
SOOKIE,I think you should call them again tomorrow.,2
LORELAI,"No, uh, Sookie. . .",2
SOOKIE,"No, I mean it. I mean, you're an upstanding citizen, you're an active part of the community.",2
RORY,"Yeah, you made all of the donkey outfits for the Christmas festival last year.",2
SOOKIE,You organized the Save the Historic Oak Tree campaign.,2
RORY,"And you played Tevye in the, uh, Stars Hollow Community Theater production of Fiddler on the Roof.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, well, five and a half stars from the Stars Hollow Gazette, unheard of 'til that time.",2
SOOKIE,They should take that into account.,2
RORY,"Yes, they should.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, they should, but they won't.",2
SOOKIE,"Hey, uh, I bet there's a room at the inn you could stay in, part time at least.",2
LORELAI,"Sookie, what was that?",2
SOOKIE,What?,2
LORELAI,That noise.,2
SOOKIE,What noise?,2
LORELAI,"Sookie, a huge thud just came from your closet.",2
SOOKIE,"Oh, yeah, that's my shoes.",2
LORELAI,Your shoes?,2
SOOKIE,"Yeah, that's my shoe closet, and um, sometimes I don't, uh, stack them properly and then, uh, they fall and then there's a thudding sound and then, uh, no, you, uh, and that's probably the sound that you just heard. Ooh, the ice cream's getting, uh, melted so you better -.",2
LORELAI,Jackson?,2
JACKSON,Yes?,2
LORELAI,How're you doing?,2
JACKSON,"I'm doing fine, you?",2
LORELAI,"Sookie, Jackson's hiding in the closet.",2
SOOKIE,Yes he is.,2
LORELAI,Why didn't you say something?,2
SOOKIE,"Well, because you were upset and you were bringing Rory over and I didn't want her to feel weird or uncomfortable.",2
LORELAI,So you stuck Jackson in the closet?,2
JACKSON,Yes she did.,2
RORY,"Jackson, come out.",2
JACKSON,I'm in my pajamas.,2
LORELAI,So are we.,2
JACKSON,"Yeah, but mine are humiliating.",2
LORELAI,We won't laugh.,2
JACKSON,Yes you will.,2
RORY,I promise we won't.,2
JACKSON,I'm fine.,2
LORELAI,"Well, are you gonna be fine in there all night 'cause that's how long we're staying - all night.",2
RORY,"And knowing Sookie, she's gonna make a big breakfast.",2
LORELAI,"That's right, so tonight will last until late tomorrow morning, so the bottom line for you here buddy is you're gonna be holed up in that closet a very, very long time.",2
JACKSON,"If I come out, you have to understand one thing.",2
LORELAI,Okay.,2
JACKSON,"I have a cousin who owns a Xerox company that specializes in taking pictures and making them into things - calendars, coffee mugs, collector plates, and pajamas.",2
LORELAI,Jackson's wearing picture pajamas?,2
SOOKIE,Yes he is.,2
LORELAI,Does he do this often?,2
SOOKIE,Almost every night.,2
RORY,What are the pictures of?,2
SOOKIE,Him.,2

SOOKIE,During high school.,2
LORELAI,Ahh!,2
SOOKIE,In his wrestling uniform.,2
LORELAI,"Jackson, you have to come out here right now!",2
JACKSON,No.,2
LORELAI,Why?,2
JACKSON,Because you sound too eager.,2
LORELAI,"I'm not eager, am I eager?",2
RORY,Put your paws down.,2
LORELAI,"Jackson, I'm not eager. I just want you to come out here and be comfortable, that's all.",2
JACKSON,"Well, okay.",2
LORELAI,Huh.,2

RORY,,2
KIM,"Yes, still. She's there, she's studying. What's that moving by your foot?",2
RORY,,2
KIM,I see something moving by your foot.,2
RORY,"Nope, there's nothing, I swear.",2
RORY,,2
RORY,And then she chased me halfway down the street with the hose. It was like a scene from Silkwood.,2
LORELAI,"Ugh, news travels way too fast around here.",2
RORY,"Four people asked me w hen we were tenting, two people asked me if we were moving, and one person asked me if we were atheists.",2
LORELAI,"See, we have to stop talking to people. We have to stay at home with the curtains drawn collecting stacks of old newspapers, muttering to each other, eating nothing but Cup of Soup and Slim Jims.",2
RORY,Hello?,2
MADELINE,"Hi Rory, it's Madeline.",2
RORY,"Oh, hi.",2
MADELINE,"Listen, I have to ask you a little favor.",2
RORY,Okay.,2
MADELINE,"Well, see, I'm working on an article for the Franklin - totally last minute. But I thought it would be really interesting to compare Chilton's overall PSAT scores to other prep schools in the area.",2
RORY,Uh huh.,2
MADELINE,"So I'm trying to compile a list of people's scores, especially the top students, and I realized I don't have yours yet.",2
RORY,"Oh, so you wanna know my PSAT scores?",2
MADELINE,"Yes, that would be great.",2
RORY,Put Paris on the phone.,2
MADELINE,Excuse me?,2
RORY,"Paris, let me talk to her.",2
MADELINE,"Oh, Paris isn't here. I don't know where she is. She's probably at her house, or maybe at the library, or maybe she's buying pencils because she goes through them so fast 'cause she pushes down on them really hard and then they break and . . .",2
RORY,Madeline.,2
MADELINE,Hold on.,2
PARIS,What?,2
RORY,Pathetic.,2
PARIS,Why won't you tell me?,2
RORY,Bye Paris.,2
PARIS,"Tell me those scores, I have to know! Rory?",2
LORELAI,Paris again?,2
RORY,Yup.,2
LORELAI,"God. You know, I think if we put Paris and my mother in a room together, the world would implode.",2
RORY,I'll keep that in mind for the next science fair.,2
LORELAI,Enough. Now I've got computer screens feeling sorry for me.,2
RORY,"Geez, how many places is that?",2
LORELAI,"Aw honey, it's not the amount of places that turns you down that matters, it's the qualityof the place that turns you down that matters. And when you've got Jacko's Loans and Stuff not wanting your business, you know it's time to hang out with the Coreys.",2
RORY,I'm sorry.,2
LORELAI,It's okay. I won't think about it tonight. I'll think about it tomorrow - at Tara. You ready?,2
RORY,"One sec. You know Mom, I hate to bring this up, but I think there's a really obvious solution to our problem.",2
LORELAI,I know hon.,2
RORY,You do?,2
LORELAI,"Yes. And frankly, I think if I sold you into white sl*very, I would miss you.",2
RORY,Mom.,2
LORELAI,"Rory, please don't go where you're going.",2
RORY,I think they would say yes.,2
LORELAI,"Of course they would say yes. And that yes would be followed by, 'Okay, okay, enough already. My God, please stop. I'm a shell, I've got nothing left to give.'",2
RORY,That's not true.,2
LORELAI,That is completely true.,2
RORY,Grandma and Grandpa would wanna help.,2
LORELAI,"Rory, I went to my parents for you for Chilton. Why? Because that was worth all the obligation. This is not.",2
RORY,This is our home.,2
LORELAI,"Yes, and I'll find a way to fix it.",2
RORY,But how?,2
LORELAI,I don't know yet.,2
RORY,"Well if you don't know yet, then maybe there's not another way.",2
LORELAI,There's always another way.,2
RORY,Was there another way with Chilton?,2
LORELAI,That was different.,2
RORY,Why was that different?,2
LORELAI,Because I said that was different and I'm the one doing the groveling and the groveling gets you judgment rights and I am judging that this is different.,2
RORY,"Well, the remaining judge begs to differ.",2
LORELAI,"Rory, I know you mean well, but I'm not gonna deal with my parents on this one, okay?",2
RORY,Mom.,2
LORELAI,No.,2
RORY,You're being stubborn.,2
LORELAI,"Oh no, have I shocked you?",2
RORY,,2
RORY,So where's Grandpa tonight?,2
EMILY,He's at work.,2
LORELAI,"Mom, did you explain to him that part of the quitting process means you don't go back to the job you quit?",2
EMILY,"He did not quit, he resigned.",2
LORELAI,"Hmm, same rules apply.",2
EMILY,"No, when you resign you have to put in a certain amount of time to get things in order. He has clients to see, certain accounts to close out.",2
RORY,Is that hard for him?,2
EMILY,"Actually, I think he's rather enjoying it.",2
RORY,Well good.,2
EMILY,"Yes, it is good. What are you taking?",2
LORELAI,Roofies.,2
RORY,Aspirin.,2
EMILY,Are you getting sick?,2
LORELAI,"No, I just have a headache.",2
EMILY,Well having a headache means you're sick. You think it's normal to have a headache?,2
LORELAI,"No, I just have a tension headache.",2
EMILY,"Well, what do you have to be tense about?",2
LORELAI,"Oh, well, I can't begin to think.",2
EMILY,You should lie down.,2
LORELAI,I'm fine.,2
EMILY,You work too hard.,2
LORELAI,"No, I don't.",2
EMILY,If you didn't work so hard you wouldn't have a tension headache.,2
LORELAI,"It's not a work tension headache, Mom.",2
EMILY,So then you are sick?,2
LORELAI,"Actually, I am, I'm sick.",2
EMILY,"I knew it, what's wrong?",2
LORELAI,Consumption with a touch of the vapors. I'm going for a leeching tonight after coffee.,2
RORY,She's got a case of exterminator-itis.,2
EMILY,What's that mean?,2
LORELAI,Nothing.,2
RORY,We have termites.,2
EMILY,Oh that's terrible!,2
LORELAI,It's not so bad.,2
RORY,They're eating our whole house.,2
LORELAI,But they always say thank you.,2
EMILY,"What does that mean, they're eating your whole house?",2
LORELAI,Rory.,2
RORY,"Well, we found out that we have all these foundation problems and it's going to be very expensive to fix and Mom can't get a loan.",2
LORELAI,That is not true.,2
RORY,You've been turned down by five banks.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, I made up Jacko's Loans and Stuff.",2
RORY,"Fine, four banks.",2
LORELAI,"Mom, uh, wait. What are you doing?",2
EMILY,I'm writing you a check.,2
LORELAI,"No you're not. Okay, hold on here.",2
EMILY,How much do you need?,2
LORELAI,Nothing.,2
EMILY,"Don't be ridiculous, just tell me how much.",2
LORELAI,I can handle this.,2
EMILY,It doesn't sound like you can handle it.,2
LORELAI,"Well, I can.",2
EMILY,"Fine, if you won't tell me how much, I'll leave the amount blank and you can fill it in later.",2
LORELAI,"Mom, stop.",2
EMILY,You took my pen!,2
LORELAI,"Mom, I appreciate the thought, but I don't need your money.",2
EMILY,So you'd rather have your house fall down then let your mother help you?,2
LORELAI,"Mom, the house is not gonna fall down. Let's not make this a big issue. Let's just sit down and have a drink and have dinner, okay?",2
EMILY,All right.,2
LORELAI,Thank you,2
EMILY,Are you going to give me back my pen?,2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,,2
RORY,"Okay, I get it, you're mad.",2
LORELAI,"Rory, I do not want to talk about this right now.",2
ORY,You were just being stubborn.,2
LORELAI,Go to bed.,2
RORY,"Well you didn't want to ask for help, so I did.",2
LORELAI,"Hey, do you rememb er the conversation we had before we left this house tonight?",2
RORY,"Yes, but -.",2
LORELAI,I told you going to my parents was not an option.,2
RORY,"I know, but -.",2
LORELAI,"In fact, I told you several times that asking my parents was not an option. Now yes, I might have made a few quips to lighten the subject matter, but I still think I made my point pretty damn clear.",2
RORY,"Fine, but we have a real problem here.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, you think I don't know that? You think I sit around all day swapping witticisms with Robert Benchley at the Algonquin? No! I am thinking and worrying and using the computer and I hate using the computer!",2
RORY,Which is exactly why I brought this up.,2
LORELAI,You had no right to bring it up!,2
RORY,Why?,2
LORELAI,"Because I told you not to, that's why!",2
RORY,But -.,2
LORELAI,"No, there are no buts! There will be no buts here! There's 'I'm sorry Mom', there's 'I screwed up Mom', there's 'I'll never do it again Mom', but there are no buts!",2
RORY,But -.,2
LORELAI,Out!,2
RORY,Mom!,2
LORELAI,,2
DEAN,Think fast! Very good.,2
RORY,You threw a basketball at my head.,2
DEAN,"No, I threw a basketball past your head.",2
RORY,What if I had turned around when you said that?,2
DEAN,"Then you might've caught it, thereby completing the whole 'think fast' equation.",2
RORY,I don't catch basketballs.,2
DEAN,Duly noted.,2
RORY,I don't even like basketballs.,2
DEAN,"Okay, I'm very sorry.",2
RORY,"In fact, out of all the sporting balls in the world, the basketball is probably my least favorite.",2
DEAN,Rory.,2
RORY,They're round and hard.,2
DEAN,Rory.,2
RORY,And they're orange.,2
DEAN,And you do realize how insane you sound right now?,2
RORY,Yes.,2
DEAN,"Okay, just checking.",2
RORY,"I'm sorry, I'm in a horrible mood.",2
DEAN,Hadn't noticed.,2
RORY,"It's just, we've had fights before.",2
DEAN,You and me?,2
RORY,Me and Mom.,2
DEAN,Ah.,2
RORY,"But this one is particularly crazy. I mean, we have a situation here and she's being so stubborn.",2
DEAN,Huh.,2
RORY,What?,2
DEAN,What what?,2
RORY,What was with the huh?,2
DEAN,Nothing.,2
RORY,"No, there was a meaning behind that huh. That was a loaded huh. That was not a normal huh. You meant to say something with that huh, and now you're taking it back.",2
DEAN,"Okay, now. . .",2
RORY,Don't use that kind of huh if you're not prepared to defend it. Why aren't you saying anything?,2
DEAN,Because words are a very dangerous thing right now.,2
RORY,You were saying that I'm stubborn just like my mother.,2
DEAN,"I was saying that in addition to all of the wonderful amazing qualities that the two of you share there is possibly, on occasion, a similar tendency to dig your heels in.",2
RORY,I hate it when we fight.,2
DEAN,I know.,2
RORY,She was so mad.,2
DEAN,Well you'll make up. You wanna get a coffee?,2
RORY,Yeah.,2
DEAN,"All right, I'll go get my ball.",2
DEAN,"If it makes you feel any better, a car ran over it.",2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,"Hi Mr. Regalsky, it's Lorelai Gilmore. Again, yes, just like the pink bunny with the drum. Uh, anyway, I was wondering if, um, you have had a chance to reconsider my loan? . . . Uh, no, I think it's Energizer. . . I know you said no, but um, you know sometimes people say no and then they wake up one morning a couple of days later and think, 'Hey, maybe I shouldn't have turned down that nice single mom with the good job and the great credentials and the references up the wazoo' . . . I do like the word wazoo. . . I understand. . .Okay, well, I'll give you a call in a couple of days then. . . Thank you.",2
MICHELorelai,Perhaps you are taking the wrong approach.,2
LORELAI,Meaning?,2
MICHELorelai,"Well, you've tried to convince them of your virtue, perhaps it's time to offer them a lap dance. You didn't.",2
LORELAI,"I was kidding, sort of.",2
MICHELorelai,Oh dear.,2
LORELAI,Well I have to do something and I'm not sure exactly where to draw the line.,2
MICHELorelai,"You know in Thailand, women do this trick with a Ping-Pong ball that is a big crowd pleaser.",2
LORELAI,"Line drawn, thank you.",2
MICHELorelai,"Independence Inn, Michel speaking. Ah, yes. She is right here. Your mother.",2
LORELAI,Hi mom.,2
EMILY,"Lorelai, I called to tell you I talked to Miles Hahn today.",2
LORELAI,"Well, that sounds very nice, I'm glad.",2
EMILY,You have any idea who Miles Hahn is?,2
LORELAI,Not a bit.,2
EMILY,He's the president of the First National Bank. We've been doing business with him for years. He's become a v ery dear friend of ours actually.,2
LORELAI,What does that have to do with me Mom?,2
EMILY,"Well, I brought up your little dilemma to him.",2
LORELAI,Oh boy.,2
EMILY,"And he told me that if you were in the mood to come talk to him, you could feel free to do so. On Thursday, at 3:15.",2
LORELAI,So you wrangled me a meet ing at your bank?,2
EMILY,I asked a friend for advice.,2
LORELAI,What else did you ask him for Mom?,2
EMILY,"Lorelai, I simply asked a man to talk to you. What you talk about or what comes out of that talk is strictly up to you.",2
LORELAI,"Well, thanks Mom, but I'm fine.",2
EMILY,So you got a loan?,2
LORELAI,I got a lead.,2
EMILY,A lead on a loan?,2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
EMILY,How nice. Now if you could just get an actual loan.,2
LORELAI,"Okay Mom, I gotta get back to work.",2
EMILY,Thursday at 3:15.,2
LORELAI,"Mom, tell your friend thank you, but I'm afraid I won't be able to make it.",2
EMILY,"He'll be there whether you show up or not, it's up to you. All I did was make an appointment Lorelai, that's all.",2
LORELAI,,2
DEAN,"Okay, so uh, I'll call you later.",2
RORY,Thanks for the coffee.,2
DEAN,You're welcome. Bye.,2
RORY,Bye. That's for me not thinking fast.,2
DEAN,Please never think fast again.,2
RORY,I'll try my hardest.,2
LANE,We need to talk.,2
RORY,"Okay, let's talk. Nice outfit.",2
LANE,Thank you.,2
RORY,So I guess this is why you've been AWOL for the past couple of weeks?,2
LANE,Pretty much.,2
RORY,"So what, you just had the urge to stand on top of another girl's shoulders?",2
LANE,Don't be like that.,2
RORY,Like what?,2
LANE,Like you're being. It makes it impossible to tell you.,2
RORY,You didn't tell me.,2
LANE,I know.,2
RORY,Why?,2
LANE,Because.,2
RORY,"Okay, have you ever thought of being a prosecutor because I think you've got real potential.",2
LANE,I didn't tell you because I knew you'd act like this.,2
RORY,"No, I'm acting like this because you didn't tell me.",2
LANE,"Oh, so if I'd come up to you and I'd said, 'Rory, I'm wanna become a cheerleader,' you would've said. . .",2
RORY,Why?,2
LANE,Exactly.,2
RORY,"Exactly what? Lane, this is weird. I mean, we always used to make fun of cheerleaders. You and I, we would rag on Janie Fertman and hide during pep rallies and now all of a sudden, you're peppy.",2
LANE,I'm not peppy.,2
RORY,Well you look peppy.,2
LANE,"Look, you're not around much anymore.",2
RORY,"Oh, so this is my fault?",2
LANE,And you have Dean.,2
RORY,So this is his fault?,2
LANE,"It's just . . .I don't know. I don't know why. I just wanted to do it. I just wanted to try it, and I don't feel like I should have to justify it to you or explain it to you or...",2
RORY,Then don't!,2
LANE,Fine I won't.,2
RORY,Okay.,2
LANE,All right. I forgot my pom.,2
RORY,Your what?,2
LANE,,2
LORELAI,"Well, how's it look?",2
LUKE,It's dark. Hand me the flashlight.,2
LORELAI,Why don't you have one of those hats with the lights on them?,2
LUKE,I flip burgers for a living.,2
LORELAI,"Right, right.",2
LUKE,Okay. I think I've seen enough.,2
LORELAI,Well how was it? Was there like a termite housing development under there? Golf courses and condos with rec rooms?,2
LUKE,It's actually not too bad.,2
LORELAI,Well what do you know? You flip burgers for a living.,2
LUKE,"I mean, there's definitely a little damage.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, but Kirk says that the joists were totally gone.",2
LUKE,"Yeah, they are.",2
LORELAI,And that the foundation has lost all its structural integrity.,2
LUKE,That's true too.,2
LORELAI,"Okay great, so I'm still screwed.",2
LUKE,Not necessarily.,2
LORELAI,"Luke, I need fifteen thousand dollars which I can't find, don't have, and if I don't find, the house is gonna fall down.",2
LUKE,I can help you with that.,2
LORELAI,You can?,2
LUKE,"Yeah, I can get a couple guys, we can get in there and do the work.",2
LORELAI,You can fix this?,2
LUKE,"Well, I can help. I know a good contractor. He did some work on the diner.",2
LORELAI,What about the money?,2
LUKE,"Um, you won't have to deal with that right away.",2
LORELAI,I won't?,2
LUKE,"No, you can pay it out in installments if you want. Monthly, bimonthly, whatever - whatever you're comfortable with.",2
LORELAI,"So, let me get this straight. Uh, you and some guys who actually know what they're doing are gonna come over and fix my house, and I can pay them back whenever I want?",2
LUKE,That's right.,2
LORELAI,'Cause I'm Tony Soprano?,2
LUKE,Only scarier.,2
LORELAI,"Now Luke, when I finally do make out this installment check, uh, who should I make it out to?",2
LUKE,"Well, you can make it out to me if you like.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, so basically you would be fronting me the money?",2
LUKE,"Well, yeah, but it's no big deal.",2
LORELAI,"Luke, that's a loan.",2
LUKE,"No, it's just a temporary exchange of money for services that will be paid back when you finally have the. . . it's a loan.",2
LORELAI,"Man, you suck as a liar. Thank you.",2
LUKE,You're welcome.,2
LORELAI,I can't take it.,2
LUKE,"I know, but it was worth a shot.",2
LORELAI,"Hey, uh, Dean called twice.",2
RORY,"Rah, rah, rah.",2
LUKE,You two. . .,2
LORELAI,Don't ask.,2
LUKE,,2
LORELAI,"Oh, excuse me, could you tell me where Mr. Hahn's office is?",2
WOMAN,"Yeah, it's right there.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, thank you.",2
LORELAI,You are not seriously sitting there.,2
EMILY,"No, it's a hologram. Lifelike, isn't it?",2
LORELAI,"Mom, why are you here?",2
EMILY,I just wanted to see if you'd show up.,2
LORELAI,I did.,2
EMILY,I see.,2
LORELAI,"Mom, you said you made this appointment for me. Not you, me.",2
EMILY,I did. But I know Miles and I thought my presence in there would - .,2
LORELAI,"Ooh, ooh. In where?",2
EMILY,In the meet ing.,2
LORELAI,Okay. Bye.,2
EMILY,,2
EMILY,"Lorelai, stop. Will you stop already?",2
LORELAI,I'm leaving Mom.,2
EMILY,"Why, because I'm here?",2
LORELAI,"This is a business meet ing. I'm not going in there with my Mommy, especially since I left my blankie at home.",2
EMILY,You're being stubborn and short sided.,2
LORELAI,Call it whatever you want.,2
EMILY,I don't understand why you would let your silly pride keep you from fixing your home.,2
LORELAI,I don't understand why you can't physically stop yourself from butting in where you don't belong.,2
EMILY,I made this appointment.,2
LORELAI,Against my will.,2
EMILY,You needed it.,2
LORELAI,I didn't ask for it.,2
EMILY,"Lorelai, this man can solve your problems, don't you understand that?",2
LORELAI,"Fine. I'll go in, you go home.",2
EMILY,"I can't go home now, his assistant already knows I'm here. It would be rude.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, here's the deal. We will both go in. You will go in that room but you will not say a word.",2
EMILY,What? But I couldn't possibly just - .,2
LORELAI,"You'll say hello, you'll ask how his wife is, and that's it. After that, you will say nothing, you will do nothing, you will sit in the corner and offer no opinions and pull a full-on Clarence Thomas, am I making myself perfectly clear?",2
EMILY,Lorelai.,2
LORELAI,"It's the only way I'm doing this, Mom.",2
EMILY,"All right, I'll be quiet. I will, I promise.",2
LORELAI,"I swear, one of these days, Alice. Pow! Right to the moon.",2
EMILY,,2
MILES,"Oh, there you are. I thought you were here, I come out and you were gone.",2
EMILY,"Oh, well, we left something in the car.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, she left something in the car, not me. I never leave anything in the car 'cause that would be irresponsible and forgetful, two things which I am not.",2
EMILY,"Miles, this is my daughter Lorelai.",2
MILES,Well hello. It's a thrill to finally meet you.,2
LORELAI,"Same here, thank you.",2
MILES,Would you two like some coffee?,2
LORELAI,No.,2
EMILY,"Coffee would be wonderful, thank you.",2
MILES,Coming right up.,2
LORELAI,"Hi, what happened to you not saying anything?",2
EMILY,"Accepting coffee is merely being sociable. Besides, I haven't asked how his wife is yet.",2
MILES,"Okay, coffee's on its way. Why don't we go on in and sit down?",2
EMILY,,2
MILES,So I understand that Richard's retiring.,2
EMILY,"Yes, he's going to be a man of leisure.",2
MILES,"Well, how nice. Any big plans?",2
EMILY,"Actually, an around the world trip has been discussed.",2
LORELAI,Really? Any dates set?,2
EMILY,"No, not yet.",2
LORELAI,Just checking.,2
MILES,"Ah, Marnie, thank you. So I guess we should probably get down to business. Lorelai, your mother tells me you're having a little trouble finding a loan.",2
LORELAI,"Yes I am. Um, you know, before we talk about this - it's so funny - my mom has just been dying to ask you how your wife is doing. Right mom?",2
EMILY,"Yes, how is Sheryl?",2
MILES,"Why, she's fine.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, good, now that we got that out of the way, about my situation.",2
MILES,"Well, Emily tells me that you have termites.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, we do. And unfortunately they have damaged the foundation of my house.",2
MILES,"That could be terrible. I remembe r when you and Richard had that foundation problem a couple years ago. What, you had a flood in your basement, wasn't that it?",2
EMILY,"Well, actually -.",2
LORELAI,"You know, Mr. Hahn, I appreciate you taking the time to meet with me today, and I know that the only reason you did is because of my mother, but she's really here today as a kind of silent participant. Uh, not even actually a participant, just a   silent. Um, so I would appreciate it if you would treat me just like any other person who was walking in off the street and asking for a loan.",2
MILES,"Oh, well, of course. If that's what you'd like.",2
LORELAI,"It is, thank you. Now, I've brought, um, all my previous loan documents and also my bank statements, numerous recommen dations including a letter from my employer which just basically says that she's not gonna fire me before you get your money back.",2
MILES,"Oh, you've taken out two previous loans on this house?",2
LORELAI,"Um, yes.",2
MILES,And this is the estimated worth of the house?,2
LORELAI,"Well, uh, yes.",2
MILES,And this is the amount in your savings account?,2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
MILES,Any other accounts not listed here?,2
LORELAI,No.,2
MILES,Any other collateral not listed here?,2
LORELAI,No.,2
MILES,"Well Ms. Gilmore, I'm sorry, I can't help you.",2
LORELAI,"Uh, that's it? So fast? You didn't even look at the letters of recommendation.",2
MILES,"Well I'm sure you're a well liked person, Ms. Gilmore. Unfortunately being well liked is not grounds for granting a loan.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, but I am good for the money. I, uh, pay off all my debts and I work really hard. I've been the executive manager of the Independence Inn for the last four years now.",2
MILES,"Ms. Gilmore, this is not a reflection of you as a person. It's simply a case where you don't have what the bank requires of every other person off the street to qualify for a loan. Therefore, there's nothing I can do.",2
LORELAI,"Well now, just think about this because, uh, I have a kid and she's gotten awfully used to the whole concept of having a roof over her head.",2
MILES,I'm sorry.,2
LORELAI,I can't leave without this loan.,2
MILES,"Well, I'm sorry.",2
LORELAI,"No, I mean it. I can't leave without knowing there's a way that I can save my house, so I'm just asking you to take five minutes and think of something, anything that I can do to get this money.",2
MILES,"Well, you can get someone to cosign the loan with you.",2
LORELAI,That's it? That's my only option?,2
MILES,I'm afraid so.,2
LORELAI,"You knew about this, didn't you? Mom?",2
EMILY,Hm?,2
LORELAI,Would you be willing. . .,2
EMILY,It would be my pleasure.,2
MILES,Wonderful. I'll have the papers drawn up today. Would you like some more coffee?,2
EMILY,,2
EMILY,"Well, I think that went very well.",2
LORELAI,So what's the new arrangement gonna be?,2
EMILY,Excuse me?,2
LORELAI,"Well, you helped me pay for Chilton, I gave you Friday night dinners, so what's this, Sunday night tea?",2
EMILY,"Lorelai, I did this for your own good.",2
LORELAI,Wednesday night bridge club?,2
EMILY,Lorelai.,2
LORELAI,Monday night football?,2
EMILY,Stop it!,2
LORELAI,"What Mom? Just please tell me, what do I owe you?",2
EMILY,,2
TAYLORory,"It's already shaping up to be the best season ever, due in part to the recent arrival of our brand new basketball coach Lou Magillian, formerly the presiding legal counsel for the Chicago Bulls. Lou, come on up here and take a bow. Those other teams had better watch out, we've got one of the big boys on our side now, huh? Shaq who? And in addition to our new coach, we're extremely proud of our brand new uniforms, thoughtfully supplied by you, the citizens of Stars Hollow, and carefully cleaned by the good people at Tricky's Dry Cleaners. If it's sticky, try Tricky's. Let's hear it for Tricky! I'm telling you, they are terrific. Red and white, very durable, little stripes on the side - oh you know what, why don't you just see for yourselves. Come on, show 'em your uniforms.",2
PLAYERory,"Mr. Doose, it's freezing out here. Why don't you let 'em see it at the game?",2
TAYLORory,"Young man, the people in this town paid good money for those uniforms. Now you show them what they paid for.",2
PLAYERory,This is crazy.,2
TAYLORory,"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the new uniforms of the fabulous fighting Minutemen.",2
BOOTSY,"Oh look at them shivering up there. They're such wimps these days. When I was on the team, it was different. We were rowdy. Three of us would've been pantsed by now.",2
LORELAI,Hey.,2
RORY,Oh hey.,2
LORELAI,I got your note.,2
RORY,"Yeah, well pinning it to the Mallomars is always a safe bet.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, coffee?",2
RORY,Please.,2
LORELAI,"So, um, Grandma and I went to the bank today.",2
RORY,How'd it go?,2
LORELAI,We got the loan.,2
RORY,Good. So then everything's okay?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, well. Wow, nice uniforms.",2
RORY,I'm sorry I told Grandma about it.,2
LORELAI,"Aw hon, listen, there's gonna be a time in our lives where occasionally I'm gonna make a mistake. It hasn't happened yet, but it might.",2
RORY,Sure.,2
LORELAI,"But I have earned the right to make that mistake, and I have earned the right to fix any problems without interference.",2
RORY,I just thought that they could help.,2
LORELAI,But I didn't want their help,2
RORY,But -.,2
LORELAI,"Rory, have you ever been without food or clothes or books or book covers for that matter or anything else you ever needed?",2
RORY,No.,2
LORELAI,"No, and see, the reason for that is me. I have a pretty good track record for keeping you alive.",2
RORY,"Yeah, you do.",2
LORELAI,"So when I tell you I can handle something, you need to respect that, especially since you have no evidence proving I won't. Understand?",2
RORY,"Yeah, I understand. I'm sorry.",2
LORELAI,I officially declare this fight over.,2
RORY,I'll drink to that.,2
LORELAI,Is that Lane?,2
RORY,"Yeah, that's Lane.",2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,Hey.,2
LANE,Hi.,2
RORY,"So the music selection, yours I assume?",2
LANE,"Yeah, there was a bit of an education process going on.",2
RORY,I liked it. Very John Waters.,2
LANE,Thank you.,2
RORY,I don't want you to think that you can't tell me things.,2
LANE,I don't wanna not tell you thing.,2
RORY,And this whole cheerleading thing ,2
LANE,I know it's weird.,2
RORY,"No, it's not that weird. I mean, if you were doing it professionally, then it would be weird. But this, it looked fun.",2
LANE,It was fun.,2
RORY,"And hey, you got them to cheer to Madness, so there must be some hope left in the world.",2
LANE,"I want you rest assured that I remain me. I mean, Nico-obsessed, Exene wannabe with forty Korean bibles under her bed. I just bounce a little more.",2
RORY,So can cheerleaders get coffee?,2
LANE,"Oh yeah, coffee's a must.",2
RORY,Yeah?,2
LANE,,2
LORELAI,"So Mom, they started work on the house yesterday.",2
EMILY,"Oh, good.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, these guys come at like the crack of dawn and all of a sudden there's all this hammer ing and drilling and dust flying everywhere.",2
RORY,It's pretty impressive actually.,2
LORELAI,,2
EMILY,How nice. They should paint that slogan on their truck. Excuse me.,2
LORELAI,Where you going?,2
EMILY,To get some mo re bread.,2
LORELAI,I think I'll go help.,2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,"Mom, I want to apologize to you.",2
EMILY,For what?,2
LORELAI,"Ah, for doubting your motives in this whole loan thing. I'm just not used to people doing things without strings attached, that's all.",2
EMILY,"By people, you mean me.",2
LORELAI,"I don't know what I would've done without your help. I mean it. I was out of ideas and then out of the blue you make this call and cosign the loan with me. I'm really, really grateful.",2
EMILY,"Well, that almost sounded sincere.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, I should've left off one of the reallys. That always tips it.",2
EMILY,"All right, I accept your apology.",2
LORELAI,Thank you.,2
EMILY,"By the way, I'm going to be having my DAR meetings at the inn from now on. I hope you don't mind.",2

LORELAI,"Thanks. Man, is it cold out there.",2
RORY,"I know, I'm freezing.",2
EMILY,"Well, come on in and sit by the fire. I'll make you both a drink and then we can talk.",2
RORY,About what?,2
LORELAI,Antennas up.,2
RORY,"Aye aye, captain.",2
EMILY,"So Lorelai, how are you?",2
LORELAI,"Um, I'm fine Mom.",2
EMILY,Rory?,2
RORY,"I'm fine too, Grandma.",2
LORELAI,How are you Mom?,2
EMILY,Also fine.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, look at that. All three of us fine, just like the Judds.",2
EMILY,"So Lorelai, are you dating?",2
LORELAI,"Uh, hm, no, I'm not dating.",2
EMILY,Really? There's no one at all?,2
LORELAI,"No, totally single.",2
Posted,02/10/02 00:53,2
EMILY,Any chance you'd get back with Max?,2
LORELAI,"No Mom, there's no chance.",2
EMILY,"What about the man at the diner, the one who refuses to shave?",2
LORELAI,"Luke, he's just a friend Mom.",2
EMILY,Do you think you'll be single your entire life?,2
LORELAI,Excuse me?,2
EMILY,"I mean, in terms of your finding someone, what do you think the odds are?",2
LORELAI,"Okay, what is going on?",2
EMILY,"Well, I visited the family mausoleum today.",2
LORELAI,Never what you think it's gonna be!,2
EMILY,"I just wanted to check on things, make sure they were keeping it up, changing the flowers, you know.",2
LORELAI,Uh huh.,2
EMILY,So I went inside and looked around and it occurred to me that there's a very limited space there.,2
LORELAI,Oh.,2
EMILY,"Now of course there's a slot open for me and Richard and you and Rory, but after the two of you   that's it. No more room for anyone else.",2
LORELAI,Ah.,2
EMILY,"Yes. So if you actually do meet someone someday, I don't know where to put him.",2
LORELAI,"Well, maybe we could just dump him at the local pool hall.",2
EMILY,Don't be silly.,2
LORELAI,"No, because this is definitely not a conversation for that.",2
EMILY,I looked into expanding into the crypt next door but the family that owns it wouldn't even discuss it with me.,2
RORY,I'm getting a little creeped out here.,2
EMILY,So I talked to the head of the cemetery and he suggested that we buy an annex.,2
RORY,An annex?,2
EMILY,Yes.,2
LORELAI,"You know, like an outlet store, it would specialize in the irregular family members.",2
EMILY,So if we do get the annex and you do eventually someday get married ,2
LORELAI,"Mom, just say it   fat chance   will you?",2
EMILY,I just meant that we'll have to decide who to move.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, oh. Well, uh. . .ugh, why don't we move Aunt Cecile? She was always so annoying at parties. She loved the knock-knock jokes.",2
RORY,Mom!,2
LORELAI,What?,2
RORY,You can't just kick out Aunt Cecile.,2
LORELAI,Knock-knock. Who's there? Pineapple. Pineapple who? That's where it ended. Never fully grasped the knock-knock concept.,2
EMILY,"She was a complete idiot. Okay, it's decided   Cecile goes.",2
LORELAI,Good.,2
RORY,Look - put me in the annex.,2
LORELAI,Unh uh. No way. You are not leaving me alone in there with Cecile.,2
RORY,Well I'm not gonna be held responsible for somebody being kicked out of their eternal resting place.,2
LORELAI,"Ooh, I have an idea. I'll probably go first, right? So when Rory kicks, just throw her in with me.",2
RORY,I'd like my own space if you don't mind.,2
LORELAI,Why? It'd totally be fun to be there together. Plus I plan to be buried with all the good CD's and my rock star belt.,2
RICHARD,Sorry I'm late. What did I miss?,2
EMILY,We were just discussing who to move to the annex.,2
RICHARD,"Oh. I vote for Cecile. Horrible woman, and those terrible jokes.",2
LORELAI,What'd I tell you?,2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,This is really good.,2
RORY,"Yeah, what is it?",2
EMILY,"Well, it -.",2
LORELAI,"No, don't tell us.",2
RORY,Why not?,2
LORELAI,"Because every time in my life that I've tasted something great but I didn't know what it was, it turned out to be something really disgusting that had I known what I was eating I never would've tried it in the first place.",2
RORY,Example?,2
LORELAI,Snails.,2
RORY,Gross.,2
LORELAI,"Eat in ignorance and enjoy it, my friend.",2
RORY,Gladly.,2
LORELAI,"So Dad, how's the retired life treating you?",2
RICHARD,"Well, fascinating actually. I find myself noticing things, everyday things that I must've witnessed a hundred times before but just walked right past. Like yesterday, your mother moved a vase, the one in the hall, and she didn't do it in front of me.",2
LORELAI,"Oh no,  cause nice girls never move vases in front of men.",2
RICHARD,And she only moved it a little but as I passed it by I noticed it had been moved.,2
RORY,Impressive.,2
RICHARD,And every day's a new discovery. Your mother changed her hair. Or she wore shoes that didn't match her purse.,2
EMILY,Richard.,2
RICHARD,Last Thursday.,2
EMILY,"Oh, for heaven's sake.",2
RICHARD,You know what else I noticed?,2
RORY,What?,2
RICHARD,"A first edition Flaubert, mint condition, shoved behind several of my Churchill biographies.",2
RORY,No!,2
RICHARD,Interested?,2
RORY,My life is good.,2
RICHARD,Follow me.,2
LORELAI,"Ooh Dad, see if you can find a pair of the new Chanel patent leather pirate boots stuffed back behind your Churchills.",2
RICHARD,Hmm.,2
LORELAI,What's up Mom?,2
EMILY,Nothing's up.,2
LORELAI,You were twitching. I saw you.,2
EMILY,You did not see me twitching.,2
LORELAI,"Mom, when Dad was talking about the vase, you were pulling a full-on Tabitha.",2
EMILY,I did not pull a Tabitha.,2
LORELAI,Something wrong?,2
EMILY,"No, nothing's wrong.",2
LORELAI,"Hm, okay, nothing's wrong.",2
EMILY,It's just that things are a little strange lately.,2
LORELAI,What is?,2
EMILY,Having him home.,2
LORELAI,Ah.,2
EMILY,"We've never really been home at the same time. I mean, we got married, we went to Europe, we came back, he went to work, and it's been that way ever since.",2
LORELAI,"Well, so now it's different.",2
EMILY,It's very different. He's always here   watching me and noticing when I move a vase and. . .I don't know. It's silly. So he noticed my hair was different. Women die for that sort of thing.,2
LORELAI,"Aw Mom, it's just an adjustment. You've had your routine, he's had his routine. You guys just need to figure out a new routine.",2
EMILY,I guess so.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, it'll just take some time. Then you'll find your rhythm and he'll go back to ignoring your hair, all will be well.",2
EMILY,"Yes, you're probably right.",2
LORELAI,"Mm, I am right. Okay, I give. What is this?",2
EMILY,Sweetbreads.,2
LORELAI,Sweetbreads. So that's uh. . .,2
EMILY,,2
PARIS,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no.",2
RORY,Paris.,2
PARIS,I'm not done.,2
RORY,Sorry.,2
PARIS,No.,2
LOUISE,Glad she finished that one.,2
PARIS,Why am I the only one who cares?,2
RORY,You're not the only one who cares.,2
PARIS,"No. I know you care, but I need everyone in this stupid room to care because I can't be the only one to care. Besides you.",2
LOUISE,It's just a contest Paris. It's not like you get a car or a lifetime supply of Rice a Roni.,2
MADELINE,"God, I love that stuff.",2
PARIS,"The Oppenheimer Award for Excellence in school journalism is not a contest. It's a statement. It says you're the best. The best writers, the best reporters, the best editors. It says that you have crushed all others who have dared to take you on. It says that every other single school in the United States of America is feeling nothing but shame and defeat and pain because of the people who won the Oppenheimer plaque. I wanna be those people, I wanna cause that pain.",2
RORY,Our paper is good.,2
PARIS,Not good enough.,2
RORY,Last week's issue - .,2
PARIS,Was a fine effort by a bunch of kids.,2
MADELINE,We are a bunch of kids.,2
PARIS,"Not when we're in this room, we're not. Flescher Prep Gazette, Broadmouth Banner, Richmond Heights Chronicle - these publications are not our competition.",2
LOUISE,Geez.,2
PARIS,"The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post - these publications are our competition.",2
MADELINE,Paris has gone bye-bye.,2
PARIS,"We need to raise the bar. We need to be better, think harder, dig deeper. I don't wanna just submit a good issue. I wanna submit a great issue, the best issue.",2
RORY,When's the deadline?,2
PARIS,One week from today.,2
RORY,"Okay, so, then we better get brainstorming. Doe anyone have an idea for a theme?",2
PARIS,Yes.,2
RORY,What?,2
PARIS,The one that wins.,2
RORY,,2
EMILY,"Graciela, I'm leaving the shopping list on the table here. And remember we need the low sudsing detergent. I have drawn a picture of what the box looks like, so for heaven's sake pay attention this time.",2
EMILY,How was your walk?,2
RICHARD,Carl Lambertson needs a new roof. I'm going to drop him a note.,2
EMILY,Good idea.,2
RICHARD,Busy day?,2
EMILY,"Mm, very.",2
RICHARD,Is that the same cup of coffee you had when I left?,2
EMILY,What?,2
RICHARD,"When I left an hour ago, you were having a cup of coffee.",2
EMILY,"Oh, no, this is a different cup of coffee.",2
RICHARD,So then that's your third cup of coffee this morning?,2
EMILY,I guess.,2
RICHARD,Interesting. I just realized you have three cups of coffee in the morning.,2
EMILY,I don't drink three cups of coffee every morning.,2
RICHARD,Every morning this week.,2
EMILY,"Well, so what?",2
RICHARD,"Nothing. Just an observation, that's all. That's a lot of coffee to drink early in the morning.",2
EMILY,Any thoughts on what you'd like for dinner tonight?,2
RICHARD,"Oh no, anything's fine.",2
EMILY,All right.,2
RICHARD,What are you writing down?,2
EMILY,Lamb chops.,2
RICHARD,Is that for tonight?,2
EMILY,Yes.,2
RICHARD,Oh.,2
EMILY,Do you not want lamb chops tonight?,2
RICHARD,"Oh, no no, lamb chops is just fine for tonight. I just thought a nice roast would also be nice for a change.",2
EMILY,Roast it is.,2
RICHARD,"Of course, if you want lamb chops  ",2
EMILY,"We're having roast, Richard.",2
RICHARD,"Okay, if that's what you want.",2
EMILY,"I'm going by the dry cleaners, anything you want me to drop off?",2
RICHARD,You're going to the dry cleaners?,2
EMILY,Yes.,2
RICHARD,Well I'll go with you.,2
EMILY,I can bring in whatever you have.,2
RICHARD,"I know, but it'd be nice to go together.",2
EMILY,"That would be terribly romantic, but I won't have time to get back here before my DAR meet ing so it's probably better if I go alone. You can come to the cleaners with me next week.",2
RICHARD,"Well yes, well I can go to the meeting with you.",2
EMILY,You want to go to my meet ing of the Daughters of the American Revolution?,2
RICHARD,"Well, well yes, I think it'd be fascinating.",2
EMILY,But I go straight from there to the symphony luncheon.,2
RICHARD,"Well, I'll tag along there too.",2
EMILY,"Yes, but from there I get my hair done, and you certainly don't want to sit around while I have my hair done.",2
RICHARD,"No, I don't.",2
EMILY,There you go.,2
RICHARD,"Well, you can cancel that.",2
EMILY,I can't cancel that. I get my hair done every Wednesday at three.,2
RICHARD,"Well, your hair looks fine.",2
EMILY,My hair looks fine because I have my hair done every Wednesday at three.,2
RICHARD,Well then what am I going to do?,2
EMILY,Why don't you go to the club?,2
RICHARD,What?,2
EMILY,"Yes, the club! You spend a fortune to belong there and you never got to go much before. Why don't you go there now?",2
RICHARD,Go to the club on a Wednesday afternoon?,2
EMILY,I think it would be perfect.,2
RICHARD,I don't even know what they do at the club on a Wednesday afternoon.,2
EMILY,No time like the present to find out.,2
RICHARD,"All right, I'll go to the club.",2
EMILY,Wonderful.,2
RICHARD,"Go to the club on a Wednesday afternoon. Life certainly is an interesting game of cards, isn't it?",2
EMILY,It certainly is.,2
RICHARD,"Well, um, I'll see you, uh, tonight.",2
EMILY,,2
LORELAI,"How about a triple feature? Three Days of the Condor, Shoah and The Jerk?",2
RORY,"Uh, Shoah's like nine and a half hours.",2
LORELAI,But The Jerk is short.,2
RORY,"Hmm, next.",2
LORELAI,"The three faces of Costner   Bull Durham, Dances with Wolves, The Postman. Tom Petty playing Tom Petty, that great big speech about  Once upon a time there was a thing called mail.' It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, it'll make you wanna mail something.",2

KIRK,You lost your card?,2
LORELAI,I might have.,2
KIRK,Was it temporary or laminated?,2
LORELAI,Laminated.,2
KIRK,That's a permanent card. You lost a permanent card.,2
LORELAI,You can just get me a n ew card Kirk.,2
KIRK,"Fine, but I hope you understand the gravity of the situation here.",2
LORELAI,I'm trying to grasp it.,2
KIRK,"I mean, these cards are agreements. It's an agreement between you and the Stars Hollow Video Store stating that you will take care of your card, that you will honor your card, that you will very, very nice to your card...",2
LORELAI,Kirk.,2
KIRK,I'll be right back.,2
LORELAI,"Thanks. Hello? Hello? Reception sucks in here, I'll be right back.",2
RORY,Okay.,2
LORELAI,Hello?,2
KIRK,It'll be ready in a minute.,2
RORY,"Hey Kirk, there are a couple of little kids over there and they're, uh, looking at this tape cover that's kind of mature. You might wanna put that stuff on a higher shelf or something.",2
KIRK,Mature? How mature?,2
RORY,"Uh, it's a half-naked woman just standing there.",2
KIRK,Is she a blonde?,2
RORY,What?,2
KIRK,,2
LORELAI,"Hey Mom, I can hear you now. What's up?",2
EMILY,You have to take your father.,2
LORELAI,What?,2
EMILY,"Tomorrow, for the whole day, just take him.",2
LORELAI,Take him where?,2
EMILY,"I don't care -- the zoo, the mall, Rhode Island, just get him out of my house!",2
LORELAI,What happened?,2
EMILY,He's going to join my water aerobics class.,2
LORELAI,What?,2
EMILY,He bought some new swim trunks today. He's out of control.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, Mom, calm down.",2
EMILY,"I can't calm down! I can't turn around without him being there, following me, staring at me.",2
LORELAI,"Well, he likes you.",2
EMILY,"Don't be cute, do not be cute. The man is driving me insane. I am going to go insane, and if you don't help me, I will take you with me.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, Mom, I would like to help you but wh --.",2
EMILY,You owe me!,2
LORELAI,What?,2
EMILY,I pay for Rory's school!,2
LORELAI,Are you serious?,2
EMILY,And I cosigned your loan! You still have a house because of me!,2
LORELAI,Are you hearing yourself?,2
EMILY,"I'm sorry but I'm desperate. I just need one day of peace and I will do anything to get it, anything.",2
LORELAI,"Okay Mom, fine, uh, I'll take him.",2
EMILY,I can't tell you how much I appreciate this.,2
RICHARD,Emily! Where are you?,2
EMILY,I have to go. Tomorrow morning.,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,"Oh my God, the most horrible thing just happened. Headmaster Charleston's office called, he's been kidnapped! Two guys broke into his house and threw him in a hefty bag, used those twisty ties and carted him off. Classes have been canceled until further notice.",2
RORY,I am going to school Mom.,2
LORELAI,"Rory, come on, it's just one day. I'll write you a note.  Dear Nazis, Rory had to miss school today on account of saving her mom from spending the entire day with her father who often looksat her like she has three heads.'",2
RORY,Out of my way please.,2
LORELAI,Do you know the last time my father and I were alone together for any extended period of time?,2
RORY,Unh uh.,2
LORELAI,I was kicked out of summer class for refusing to call the camp counselor Peaches because I thought the entire concept of the counselors choosing summer fruit names was stupid. So they called my dad and he came to get me and it was just the two of us alone in the car all the way from Maine with nothing to talk about but my camp failure. Luckily I had also flashed the swim team or even that subject would've gotten stale.,2
RORY,"Mom, I have the Franklin today. I cannot miss it.",2
LORELAI,"Rory, please. I can't handle the entire day with him. I can't, I can't, I caaaaan't.",2
RORY,"Mom, I promise. Just make it till the afternoon, and then I promise I'll come right home and I'll take Grandpa off your hands.",2
LORELAI,All right.,2
RORY,It'll be fine.,2
LORELAI,"It is not going to be fine. It's going to be horrible. It is going to be a bad, depressing Lifetime mo vie and Nancy McKeon will be playing me. I am Jo.",2
LORELAI,And that would be him.,2
RORY,It's not going to be that bad. Hey. Be nice.,2
LORELAI,Be nice.,2
RORY,"Oh, very good.",2
LORELAI,Hi Dad.,2
RORY,Hey Grandpa.,2
RICHARD,Good morning girls.,2
LORELAI,Did you have any trouble getting here?,2
RICHARD,"Not at all, the directions were fine.",2
RORY,"Well I have to be going, but I'll see you this afternoon.",2
RICHARD,I look forward to it.,2
RORY,Have fun.,2
LORELAI,"So good drive, huh?",2
RICHARD,Very good.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, here. Would you like some coffee?",2
RICHARD,I'm fine. Do you want coffee?,2
LORELAI,"Oh yes, God yes, thank you.",2
LORELAI,"So you sure you don't, um. . .",2
RICHARD,"Coffee? Uh, no, no, no, no.",2
LORELAI,"Well, uh, can I offer you anything else? Some Pop Tarts or. . .well, that's pretty much it.",2
RICHARD,You don't have to entertain me Lorelai. I just came here to see you and your house and your town. You don't have to do anything special for me.,2
LORELAI,But you're my guest.,2
RICHARD,"No, I'm your father. Just do whatever it is you would normally do.",2
LORELAI,What I would normally do.,2
RICHARD,"Yes. Like for instance, this morning if I wasn't here, you would wake up, obviously get some coffee and. . .then what?",2
LORELAI,"Well, um, I'd probably read the paper for a little while and then have some breakfast.",2
RICHARD,Let's read the paper then.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, let's read the paper. Um, what sections would you like?",2
RICHARD,"Oh, you go first. I'll take what's left.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, okay. Well, um, normally I read the Arts and Leisure and the Lifestyles.",2
RICHARD,"Perfect. Well, that leaves Business, Sports, and World News.",2
LORELAI,Oh. That worked out well.,2
RICHARD,,2
LORELAI,"Well, this is it, Luke's.",2
RICHARD,"You know, when I was in college, there was this horrible little diner across from my apartment building. It was run by this terrible little couple, they were very angry. They would fight, break plates, curse, and I went in there every morning for three years and I had the mostdreadful breakfast, just awful. I really miss that place.",2
LUKE,Morning.,2
LORELAI,"Hey. Um, Luke, you rememb er my father?",2
LUKE,"Oh yeah, nice to see you again.",2
RICHARD,Nice to see you. This is quite a place you've got here.,2
LUKE,It pays the bills.,2
RICHARD,Always a plus in business.,2
LORELAI,"Dad, do you know what you want?",2
RICHARD,"Oh, I already ate.",2
LORELAI,You did? When?,2
RICHARD,"Oh, I had breakfast at home. I get up at 5:30 every morning.",2
LORELAI,Wow. Why?,2
RICHARD,Well I've gotten up at 5:30 for as long as I can remember.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, but that was when you had to work. Now you can afford to get a little crazy, get up at quarter to six.",2
RICHARD,Go ahead and order Lorelai.,2
LORELAI,"Okay. I'll have a banana, pancakes, side of bacon, and lots and lots of coffee.",2
LUKE,Coming right up.,2
RICHARD,You didn't order any grapefruit.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, I don't really like grapefruit.",2
RICHARD,"Oh, I always start my breakfast off with half a grapefruit.",2
LORELAI,"Hm, do the Florida people know about you? Because Anita Bryant left this huge gap that has yet to be filled.",2
RICHARD,"It's important to start the day off correctly, Lorelai. A grapefruit is brain food. It has vitamin C and folic acid and it helps with your digestion. It really is a terrific fruit.",2
LORELAI,I feel like you're about to break into song.,2
RICHARD,I'm serious about this Lorelai.,2
LORELAI,I know you are but I still don't like grapefruit.,2
RICHARD,"Well, there are many things in life that we don't like, but the benefits they bring us far outweigh the temporary discomforts we have to endure.",2
LORELAI,Okay. Hold on a sec.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, I need a grapefruit.",2
LUKE,What?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah. Before my pancakes this morning I need half a grapefruit, uh, preferably one that tastes like a donut.",2
LUKE,I don't have grapefruit.,2
LORELAI,How can you not have grapefruit?,2
LUKE,I've never had grapefruit.,2
LORELAI,"I need a grapefr. . .Listen, I have my father with me all day, and so far there's been no major drama or yelling or ugliness but there will be if I don't somehow find a way to get half a grapefruit for breakfast this morning.",2
LUKE,I could go next door to Doose's and buy a grapefruit.,2
LORELAI,I would be eternally grateful.,2
LUKE,I'll be right back.,2
LORELAI,Thank you.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, the grapefruit is coming.",2
RICHARD,"Oh, you won't be sorry.",2
LORELAI,"So listen, I was thinking, um, maybe after we're done here, you might like to walk around town a little, see the sites. And then Rory usually gets home around four. The two of you can hang out at the house until I get off work and the three of us can hook up for dinner. How does that sound?",2
RICHARD,Very sensible.,2
LORELAI,"Well yeah, I had to make up for my shoes.",2
RICHARD,Is that your second cup of coffee?,2
LORELAI,"Uh, third. Why?",2
RICHARD,,2
RORY,"Okay, you have got to stop doing that.",2
PARIS,"So I've been doing some research on the Oppenheimer Award, and I've noticed something. All of the winning schools had an extremely strong human interest story on page one.",2
RORY,Okay.,2
PARIS,"And I think that's what we need. I mean, we've got the teen issues down, we've got a decent op-ed and political page, but human interest   that's what we're missing.",2
RORY,Ideas?,2
PARIS,Yes.,2
RORY,Do tell.,2
PARIS,"According to the papers, there's been a huge increase in the number of families fleeing the major cities in favor of small towns. Hundreds of thousands of city slicking yuppies carting the trophy wife and the asthmatic kids off to small towns in search of the simple life. Milk a cow, pet a pig, find yourself, all that kind of crap.",2
RORY,Interesting.,2
PARIS,"Yeah, and I thought about it. There's a romantic aspect to small towns. White picket fences, low crime rate, smaller classrooms, better tomatoes. It all seems perfect.",2
RORY,But?,2
PARIS,"But nothing is perfect, nothing is safe, nothing is ever what it seems. And then it hit me - our story. We are going to blow the lid off the seedy underbelly of small town life, starting with yours.",2
RORY,Stars Hollows?,2
PARIS,Yes.,2
RORY,You are going to uncover the seedy underbelly of Stars Hollow?,2
PARIS,Yes.,2
RORY,"Paris, Stars Hollow doesn't have a seedy underbelly. We don't even have a meter maid.",2
PARIS,"Look, you may be blind to it because you live there, but trust me, it's there and it's ugly and I'm going to find it. I'll meet you out front after school.",2
RORY,I can't today.,2
PARIS,Why not? Are you hiding something?,2
RORY,No. I promised my mom that I would help her with something.,2
PARIS,"Well, help her tomorrow. We have work to do.",2
RORY,Paris!,2
PARIS,"Hey, this could be our chance to nail this thing. Now I have a hunch that there's a story here and a good one, and I'm going to find it. I was even going to share a byline with you on it, but if you wanna bail out, that's fine. I'll just do it myself.",2
RORY,But -.,2
PARIS,Am I meet ing you or not?,2
RORY,I don't think you're gonna find anything.,2
PARIS,,2
MICHELorelai,"As soon as I can, I will send someone up. . . Yes, I will. . .I understand. . .I understand. . .I understand. . .I understand. . .I understand. . . Okay. . .I understand. Goodbye.",2
LORELAI,What do you understand?,2
MICHELorelai,I have no idea. I tuned him out at the first screech.,2
LORELAI,Have we heard from Manny yet?,2
MICHELorelai,"No, and I have paged him twice.",2
LORELAI,We only have enough linen for one seating tonight. Hand me the phone.,2
MICHELorelai,Plus we are completely out of clean towels.,2
LORELAI,"Hi, Sophie, it's Lorelai. I need to talk to Manny. . . Well, when will he be back? . . . Okay, I need him to call me really, really soon, like five minutes ago. Okay, thanks. We need a backup plan.",2
MICHELorelai,Mm hmm.,2
LORELAI,Call Patty's and see if she has any party rental tablecloths we can use for tonight and then pull all the towels from the pool and call Gandolfi's and order a case of champagne. Send a bottle to every room that's towel-less and just page him every two minutes and oh no!,2
RICHARD,Hi.,2
LORELAI,"Hi Dad, what are you doing? Uh, I thought you were gonna tour the town.",2
RICHARD,"Oh, I did, I did. I went into all the stores, the cat one twice. And then I walked around a little and then I was done.",2
LORELAI,But what about the park   did you see the park?,2
RICHARD,"Yes, I saw the park.",2
LORELAI,"Uh, what about the giant slinky over on Klump? We're mighty proud of that.",2
RICHARD,"I saw the slinky, yes. And the hundred-year-old oak tree and the life-size yarn person. I even stopped by your house and had Babette introduce me to all of her gnomes.",2
LORELAI,Oh.,2
RICHARD,And then I realized the only thing I had not seen is my daughter at work.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, well, watching me at work is not very interesting, trust me.",2
RICHARD,"Oh, you underestimate yourself.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, well, um, there's books on the shelves over there.",2
RICHARD,"No no, I have my newspaper, I'm fine.",2
LORELAI,"All right, I'm just gonna. . . what's the matter?",2
RICHARD,Is your jacket in the back?,2
LORELAI,My jacket?,2
RICHARD,Your work jacket?,2
LORELAI,I don't have a work jacket.,2
RICHARD,So that's your working outfit?,2
LORELAI,Yeah.,2
RICHARD,And your boss doesn't mind?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, well considering my boss is me, no, she doesn't. I mean, she did at first but then I bought her a cup of coffee and I realized all the hostility she was expressing toward me was just jealousy and we've been best friends ever since. Just take a seat Dad. Hey, will you get me an extra bottle of champagne and smack me over the head with it?",2
MICHELorelai,Absolutely.,2
LORELAI,Independence Inn.,2
RORY,"I need you to sit down, breathe, and remember that you're at work, so screaming and crying is not an option.",2
LORELAI,"Why, what are you doing?",2
RORY,I can't meet you after school today.,2
LORELAI,What? You promised.,2
RORY,"I know but I have to work on this story for the Franklin and I swear I tried to get out of it, but I couldn't.",2
LORELAI,Oh great.,2
RORY,I'm sorry.,2
LORELAI,"Oh no, school comes before Mommy's mental health.",2
RORY,Just tell Grandpa to wander around for awhile.,2
LORELAI,He already wandered.,2
RORY,Did he see the slinky?,2
LORELAI,"Yes, he saw the slinky.",2
RORY,Wow.,2
LORELAI,He's here now.,2
RORY,Oh.,2
LORELAI,And he hates my shirt.,2
RORY,Give him a book and have Sookie make him lunch and I swear I'll be home by dinner and you won't have to say a word.,2
LORELAI,,2
PARIS,I think I got rabies.,2
RORY,"It's just a bus, Paris.",2
PARIS,It smelled.,2
RORY,It smelled like a bus.,2
PARIS,I'm gonna have to burn my clothes when I get home.,2
RORY,"You know Paris, you have a car. We could've driven.",2
PARIS,We have to get the feel of the small town world. You're not going to get the feel of a small town world in a BMW. Is there something crawling in my hair?,2
RORY,"All right, so we're here now, where do you wanna go?",2
PARIS,"I don't know, where's the bad part of town?",2
RORY,"Uhh, over there.",2
PARIS,What?,2
RORY,"Uh, people - they're very upset with the color of that fence.",2
PARIS,Come on.,2
RORY,"This is the town Paris, this is it. It's not seedy, it's not rundown, it's just Stars Hollow.",2
PARIS,"Well, where's the local bar?",2
RORY,In Woodbridge.,2
PARIS,Why aren't you helping?,2
RORY,"I'm trying, you're just looking for something that's not here.",2
PARIS,What's this?,2
RORY,Luke's Diner.,2
PARIS,,2
RORY,What are you doing?,2
PARIS,"Trying just to blend in, fade away, observe.",2
LUKE,Hey Rory. Coffee?,2
RORY,Thanks Luke.,2
LUKE,Who's your friend?,2
RORY,Angela Landsbury.,2
LUKE,Oh.,2
PARIS,You're the owner here?,2
LUKE,Yup. You want some coffee Angela?,2
PARIS,No thanks.,2
LUKE,Okay.,2
PARIS,"So, you run the diner, huh?",2
RORY,Oh boy.,2
PARIS,You get a lot of truckers through here?,2
LUKE,Truckers?,2
PARIS,"Yeah. You know, guys on the road for weeks, lonely, looking for company, a little pick me up. Things like that.",2
LUKE,What's she talking about?,2
RORY,Your guess is as good as mine.,2
PARIS,It's pretty common knowledge that diners are breeding grounds for prostitution and drug dealers.,2
LUKE,What?,2
PARIS,Have you ever seen anything like that going down here?,2
LUKE,Have I ever. . .,2
PARIS,What about that guy over there? What's his story?,2
LUKE,Reverend Nichols?,2
PARIS,"Reverend Nichols, huh? What is that, like Dr. Feelgood?",2
LUKE,"Rory, how much do you like this person?",2
RORY,"Do what you gotta do, Luke.",2
PARIS,"Hey, where'd he come from? What's up there? Is that where you keep the girls? You got yourself a little cathouse up there?",2
JESS,"Wow, I think she got you Uncle Luke. You better give up now.",2
LUKE,Do not add to this insanity.,2
JESS,An innocent boy like me should not be raised in an atmosphere like this.,2
LUKE,Jess!,2
JESS,"I wanna be good, life's just not letting me.",2
LUKE,"Rory, get her out of here.",2
RORY,"Okay, let's go.",2
PARIS,Why do you need me to leave? What have you got to hide?,2
RORY,,2
MICHELorelai,"Yes, we're aware of it.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, we're working on it.",2
MICHELorelai,"As soon as towels arrive, yours will be the first room we come up to.",2
LORELAI,"I swear to you, no one gets a towel before you do.",2
MICHELorelai,Did you get the complimentary champagne we sent you?,2
LORELAI,Just open the champagne and drink and relax and enjoy and before you know it   of course it's free. Yes.,2
MICHELorelai,"Yeah, we'll call you soon.",2
LORELAI,We'll talk to you soon. I'm k*lling Manny.,2
MICHELorelai,I'm helping.,2
LORELAI,"I'm gonna strangle him with one of his own towels, I swear to God.",2
RICHARD,Lorelai?,2
LORELAI,Yeah Dad?,2
RICHARD,Do you realize there are no tablecloths in the dining room?,2
LORELAI,Yes I do. We're having a problem with our linen delivery.,2
RICHARD,"Well, it doesn't look very professional.",2
MICHELorelai,"Ah, it's Manny.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, I have to take this dad.",2
LORELAI,"Manny, my mysterious man, where have you been? . . . Oh, me Manny? I'm just a desperate woman. Yes. Honey, I know you're up to your ears in problems but I have to have some towels or linens or I'm gonna be lying on the street talking about the pretty inn I used to work at and you don't want that do you? . . . Well, just, anything you can do to get me through the night. . . Uh, Manny, I love you. You rock. I am devoted to you. I'm never gonna look at another towel without thinking of you. . . Thank you. Bye Stud. He'll be here in twenty minutes.",2
RICHARD,Lorelai?,2
LORELAI,Yes Dad?,2
RICHARD,May I speak to you for a moment please?,2
MICHELorelai,Someone is in trouble.,2
LORELAI,"Uh, is something wrong Dad?",2
RICHARD,Was that a business call I just overheard there?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, that was my linen delivery guy.",2
RICHARD,So it was a business call?,2
LORELAI,"Yes, it was a business call.",2
RICHARD,And that's how you handle a business call?,2
LORELAI,"I've known Manny for ten years, Dad.",2
RICHARD,"I don't care how long you've known him. You never talk to a business associate like that, especially not one that you employ.",2
LORELAI,Okay Dad.,2
RICHARD,These people have to respect you.,2
LORELAI,He does respect me.,2
RICHARD,You were flirting with him.,2
LORELAI,"I said what I needed to say in order to get the linen before somebody else did. And I did, so I won.",2
RICHARD,"This is not about winning, this is about proper procedure. You need to listen to me Lorelai. If there is one thing I know about, it is the correct way to conduct yourself in a position of authority. Do you understand what I'm trying to tell you?",2
LORELAI,Mm hmm.,2
RICHARD,Because I'm only telling you this for your own good.,2
LORELAI,Mm hmm.,2
RICHARD,"All right, go back to work. I'll be right here if you need me.",2
LORELAI,,2
PARIS,"Nothing, not even a cigarette butt on the ground, I can't believe it. This town would make Frank Capra wanna throw up.",2
RORY,"Sorry, I tried to tell you.",2
PARIS,"I know. I know, it's just. . .I was just so sure.",2
RORY,"We'll think of something else to write about, I promise.",2
PARIS,We're going to lose.,2
RORY,We're not going to lose.,2
TAYLORory,"There she is, the girl of the moment.",2
RORY,Me?,2
TAYLORory,"You, young lady, are my hero.",2
RORY,Why is that Taylor?,2
TAYLORory,"Because in this day and age when the kids are willy nilly with their clothes and hair and morals, it is heartwarming to see a sensible girl like you still exists. A girl who has the gumption and the guts to stand up and say,  why are we allowing this trash out where all our children can see it?'",2
KIRK,And a few selected adults also.,2
RORY,What are you talking about?,2
TAYLORory,,2
RORY,What happened? Where is everything?,2
TAYLORory,"Well, thanks to your brilliant suggestion, they are all safely stashed behind the Rory Curtain.",2
RORY,The what?,2
KIRK,We thought it was only fitting to name it after you.,2
RORY,"No! I don't want a Rory Curtain, I never asked for a Rory Curtain!",2
TAYLORory,You told me to put that movie where the kids couldn't see it.,2
PARIS,You did?,2
RORY,"Well, yeah, but I just meant to put it on a higher shelf, not to get fabric involved.",2
TAYLORory,"Oh, this is much better than a higher shelf. Now all the movies that we deem objectionable will be safely hidden from the eyes of the children. Plus, it'll make the adults think twice before they go back there.",2
RORY,"No, I did not mean to do this! What are you doing?",2
PARIS,This is it.,2
RORY,This is what?,2
PARIS,"Our story. Censorship in a small town, it's perfect.",2
RORY,"Paris, stop it. You know I don't believe in censorship.",2
PARIS,"Even better, small town minds run amok. This is genius, it's gold. We're going to win. Now Taylor?",2
TAYLORory,Yes?,2
PARIS,,2
LORELAI,"Rory, we're home!",2
RICHARD,"Next time, stop the car completely before you get out.",2
LORELAI,"Rory, for the love of God, be home!",2
RORY,"I'm here, sorry! I was on the phone. How was your   Ooh, okay.",2
LORELAI,I don't think I've ever loved you quite as much as I love you right now.,2
RORY,"Ah, ribs cracking, organs crushing.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, well, love hurts.",2
RORY,Hey Grandpa.,2
RICHARD,"Oh, lovely to see you Rory.",2
RORY,How was your day?,2
RICHARD,It was very pleasant.,2
RORY,I heard you saw Mom in action.,2
LORELAI,Oh yes he did.,2
RORY,"She's great, isn't she?",2
RICHARD,"She's. . uh, spirited.",2
LORELAI,Spirited.,2
RORY,"Spirited is nice. Hey, let's talk dinner. How about Chinese?",2
LORELAI,Very spirited food.,2
RORY,"Grandpa, do you like Chinese food?",2
RICHARD,"If prepared properly, yes, I like it very much.",2
LORELAI,I'll go call Al's.,2
RICHARD,Al's?,2
RORY,Al's Pancake World.,2
RICHARD,I thought you said we were having Chinese food.,2
LORELAI,Al's has the best egg fu yung in Stars Hollow.,2
RICHARD,"Is that, um, saying anything?",2
LORELAI,"Rory, come en tertain your Grandpa while your spirited Mommy orders please!",2
RORY,"Hey Grandpa, do you um. . .do you wanna see my room?",2
RICHARD,"Yes, I would.",2
RORY,Okay.,2
LORELAI,Twenty bucks if you lock him in there.,2
RORY,,2
RICHARD,Interesting.,2
RORY,What are you doing?,2
RICHARD,"Oh, there are some holes in your collection here and I'm just making a list to fill them.",2
RORY,"Oh, well these aren't all of my books.",2
RICHARD,Oh?,2
RICHARD,Oh my goodness!,2
RORY,And. . .,2
RICHARD,"Ah, well possibly I should concentrate on acquiring you a bookcase first.",2
RORY,That's okay. I kind of like my system.,2
RICHARD,"Ah, organized chaos?",2
RORY,Exactly.,2
RICHARD,"Very well, carry on. Well, I'm glad not to see any death rockers on your walls.",2
RORY,"Grandpa, where did you learn the term death rockers?",2
RICHARD,"Well, I'm not entirely unfamiliar with the music world in which you live.",2
RORY,"I don't exactly live in the death rock world, Grandpa.",2
RICHARD,Good.,2
RORY,"But if I do move there, I will send you a card.",2
RICHARD,"Oh, I appreciate that. Ah, Harvard.",2
RORY,"Yeah. We started the obsession board a few years ago. And then when we took that trip to Harvard, the student store was having a two for one flag sale, so that kind of sent us into the final stage of the psychosis. Hospitals were called, medications were prescribed, there is no cure.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, I made the menu for the evening.",2
RICHARD,My God.,2
RORY,Looks good.,2
RICHARD,Who could eat all that food?,2
LORELAI,I almost added the garlic chicken.,2
RORY,Add it.,2
RICHARD,There are only three of us.,2
LORELAI,"Yes, but we like choices.",2
RORY,"Let's call, I'm starved.",2
RICHARD,"Lorelai, you cannot order all of that food. You're teaching your daughter wastefulness and gluttony.",2
LORELAI,"Um Dad, we do this all the time. We order way too much and then we eat like a third of it and live off the leftovers for a week and a half. It's a finely honed system. Now please, just sit and read something or watch TV.",2
RICHARD,So I uh. . .I noticed all the Harvard paraphernalia in Rory's room.,2
LORELAI,Oh yeah.,2
RICHARD,"You know, you might not want to get her settled on one specific college quite so soon.",2
LORELAI,Why not?,2
RICHARD,"Well, she's young. She hasn't investigated her options.",2
LORELAI,"Dad, she wants to go to Harvard.",2
RICHARD,"Well yes, because she thinks you want her to go to Harvard.",2
LORELAI,I do.,2
RICHARD,"Well, there are a lot of other good schools out there. You know I went to Yale.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, I do know.",2
RICHARD,"Yale is a very fine school, some might argue a better school than Harvard.",2
LORELAI,Some mean ing you?,2
RICHARD,"I just think Rory should explore it, and I can make some phone calls and set up an appointment.",2
LORELAI,No.,2
RICHARD,Why not?,2
LORELAI,Because she wants to go to Harvard.,2
RICHARD,But that's ridiculous. Who's going to help her get into Harvard?,2
LORELAI,Reese Witherspoon.,2
RICHARD,I am a Yale alumnus. I give a great deal of money to that school. Getting her in will be a breeze.,2
LORELAI,"We don't like breezes, they mess up our hair.",2
RICHARD,Do not be petulant Lorelai.,2
LORELAI,Do not pick a fight with me D ad.,2
RICHARD,"This is not about you, this is about Rory.",2
LORELAI,"No, this is about Richard interfering.",2
RICHARD,"Now please, just let me handle this. I know more about the Ivy League system than you do.",2
LORELAI,This is not about the - .,2
RORY,Is that the food already?,2
LORELAI,"No Sweets, I haven't ordered yet.",2
RORY,Oh my God!,2
LORELAI,Who is it?,2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,Oh my God.,2
RORY,Whatcha doin'?,2
DEAN,Just standing here.,2
RORY,Next to?,2
DEAN,A car. Your car.,2
RORY,No!,2
DEAN,Finished it yesterday.,2
RORY,No you didn't!,2
DEAN,Do you want them?,2
RORY,Ah!,2
DEAN,"Now if you don't like it, I bet I can sell it to someone else.",2
RORY,Don't you dare!,2
LORELAI,"Dean, that's amazing!",2
RORY,"Let's drive, can we drive, does it drive?",2
DEAN,Does it drive?,2
RORY,"Well, no, I know it drives but. . .oh my God! I can't believe you finished it! You built me a car!",2
LORELAI,"Dean, now that you're done with that, will you build me a plane? One that looks like Shamu?",2
RICHARD,He made that car?,2
LORELAI,Isn't that incredible?,2
RICHARD,"Well, she can't accept it.",2
LORELAI,"Oh Dad, it's okay.",2
RICHARD,"It's not okay, he's a child. She's not driving a car a child put together.",2
DEAN,"Excuse me sir, but, uh, my father worked on cars and my grandfather worked on cars. I know what I'm doing.",2
RICHARD,"A car is not a model airplane, young man.",2
DEAN,I know that.,2
RICHARD,It is a complex vehicle.,2
DEAN,I know that too.,2
RICHARD,And I will not have my granddaughter driving around in some contraption you put together in auto shop.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, can I just say something here?",2
DEAN,I did not make this in auto shop. I am telling you this car is safe.,2
RICHARD,"So, you are a certified mechanic?",2
DEAN,No.,2
RICHARD,But you had the assistance of a certified mechanic?,2
DEAN,No.,2
RICHARD,"Well, then you drove it past a certified mechanic?",2
LORELAI,"Dad, stop it. This is a nice thing Dean did here. Remember, nice things.",2
RICHARD,"I'm sorry, she can't accept it. Now, if you will excuse us, we were about to order dinner.",2
DEAN,"Mr. Gilmore, I understand you want Rory to be safe, but so do I. I would not give this car to her if I did not know for a fact that it was a hundred percent safe. I checked it, my father checked it, and Gypsy at Hewes Brothers checked it. It has been checked.",2
RICHARD,And I'm just supposed to take your word for it?,2
DEAN,Nope.,2
RICHARD,Agreed.,2
DEAN,Let's go.,2
RICHARD,Go where?,2
DEAN,To check it.,2
RICHARD,I don't think so.,2
DEAN,I've been working on this car for months. I'm giving it to Rory.,2
RICHARD,You're a very stubborn boy.,2
DEAN,Do you wanna drive or should I?,2
RICHARD,"I'll take my own car, thank you.",2
DEAN,Fine with me.,2
RICHARD,And drive behind me. I don't want that thing blowing up right in front of the Jag.,2
DEAN,No problem. Try to keep your electrical system working long enough to get there.,2
RICHARD,"They worked the kinks out of this electrical system years ago, young man. I'll be right back.",2
DEAN,So will I.,2
LORELAI,,2
GYPSY,It looks fine to me.,2
RICHARD,Check it again.,2
GYPSY,"I already checked it again. This was checking it again. I checked it earlier, that means this was checking it again.",2
DEAN,"Go ahead Gypsy, check it again. I've got all night.",2
GYPSY,I don't.,2
RICHARD,Check the transmission.,2
GYPSY,"I did, it's all good.",2
RICHARD,The carburetor.,2
GYPSY,All good.,2
RICHARD,Manifold pressure?,2
GYPSY,Best manifold pressure I've ever seen.,2
RICHARD,You've missed something. I insist that you go over this entire car again.,2
GYPSY,"But I'm telling you, there's nothing wrong with this car.",2
RICHARD,"I am paying you for a service, I would like that service performed.",2
GYPSY,"Okay, I look again.",2
DEAN,How many times are you gonna make her do that?,2
RICHARD,As many times as it takes.,2
DEAN,"Look, I know you think I'm not good enough for Rory, but do you have to take it out on my car?",2
RICHARD,"She's my only granddaughter. I have a responsibility to protect her. She's young, she's naïve.",2
DEAN,She's smart.,2
RICHARD,"Yes, she's smart. . .about certain things.",2
DEAN,"Look, I'm not about to do battle with you here. You can hate me - whatever, I don't care.",2
RICHARD,I hardly hate you.,2
DEAN,Really?,2
RICHARD,I don't even know you.,2
DEAN,"Well, I'm right here. What do you wanna know? Besides what college I wanna go to or what I wanna do for a living, because I still have no answers for you on that front.",2
RICHARD,Those are not ridiculous questions to ask.,2
DEAN,"No, but you could've waited until dessert to get to them.",2
RICHARD,"Yes, well, perhaps the timing of the. . .",2
DEAN,Interrogation?,2
RICHARD,Conversation.,2
DEAN,Conversation.,2
RICHARD,"Perhaps the timing was a little off. So, your father   what does he do?",2
DEAN,Stereo systems.,2
RICHARD,Installing them?,2
DEAN,Selling them. He's got a shop a couple of blocks from here.,2
RICHARD,And your mother?,2
DEAN,She works part time transcribing medical records.,2
RICHARD,"Interesting, interesting. So, you. . .you like my granddaughter quite a bit?",2
DEAN,"No, I love your granddaughter quite a bit.",2
RICHARD,"See Dean, I was beginning to feel a little better about this until you said that.",2
DEAN,"Well, I'm not trying to make you feel better, I'm trying to be honest.",2
RICHARD,"Yes, you are. It's an admirable quality.",2
DEAN,Thank you.,2
GYPSY,"Okay, I found something wrong.",2
RICHARD,You did?,2
DEAN,What?,2
GYPSY,"Windshield wipers came right off in my hand, very dangerous. Thank God I check it again.",2
DEAN,"Gypsy, you broke those off yourself.",2
GYPSY,Yes I did.,2
DEAN,Put them back!,2
GYPSY,I can't look at this car anymore.,2
DEAN,Gypsy!,2
GYPSY,I miss my home.,2
DEAN,Put them back.,2
RICHARD,Now I suppose the car is safe.,2
DEAN,It is.,2
RICHARD,I'm still not sure it's an appropriate gift.,2
DEAN,I understand that.,2
RICHARD,How tall are you?,2
DEAN,"Why, you wanna dance?",2
RICHARD,,2
RORY,How long are they going to be?,2
LORELAI,"I don't know. Knowing my dad, he probably made Dean take the entire thing apart and put it back together again in front of him.",2
RORY,Poor Dean.,2
LORELAI,"Poor Dean, he has to spend one evening with him. I share chromosomes with the guy.",2
RICHARD,"Well, we had it thoroughly checked. We found a little problem with the windshield wipers. Dean is there now adjusting them. But once that is taken care of, I don't see any reason why, with proper insurance of course, why you can't have that car.",2
RORY,Really? Thanks!,2
LORELAI,"Hey hon, why don't you run and pick up the food for us?",2
RORY,Oh sure.,2
RICHARD,"Oh, I've got this.",2
LORELAI,"Here you go, hurry! Before the mu shu congeals.",2
RORY,Okay.,2
RICHARD,Why didn't you let me pay?,2
LORELAI,"I didn't think it would be, um, appropriate under the circumstances.",2
RICHARD,What circumstances are those?,2
LORELAI,"The ones where I'm about to get really, really mad at you.",2
RICHARD,Excuse me?,2
LORELAI,"Dad, this is my house in my town, where I live my life.",2
RICHARD,"Well, thank you for the geography lesson.",2
LORELAI,"No, I'm - in the thirty two years we've known each other, have I once come to your work and criticized the way you handled your clients?",2
RICHARD,I don't rememb er you coming to my work at all.,2
LORELAI,"Well, have I passed judgment on your breakfast habits or your clothing choices?",2
RICHARD,I was offering opinions.,2
LORELAI,"Well, don't. I don't want your opinions, especially not in front of my employees and not in front of my friends.",2
RICHARD,I guess you can't take constructive criticism.,2
LORELAI,"Nothing that came out of your mouth today might, in any universe visited by Kirk or Spock, be construed as constructive.",2
RICHARD,I beg to differ.,2
LORELAI,And this is absolutely the last time you come into my house and overrule my word.,2
RICHARD,What are you talking about?,2
LORELAI,I'm talking about Dean and the car.,2
RICHARD,I was being - .,2
LORELAI,"You have no right being anything. Rory's my kid and I make the rules, so if she comes home one day and says,  Hey, uh, I'm gonna spend the weekend with Patricia Krenwinkle' and I say,  Okay, grab a sweater', you just have to deal.",2
RICHARD,Who is Patricia Krenwinkle?,2
LORELAI,"And if I tell her that she can have the car that her boyfriend made for her, then she can.",2
RICHARD,I didn't think it looked safe.,2
LORELAI,"You don't have to think it looks safe! I have to think it looks safe! God, why can't I make you hear what I'm saying?",2
RICHARD,"Oh, I hear exactly what you're saying.",2
LORELAI,"You came here not as a guest but as the judgment police, you kept your uniform on the whole time, and you know what, it comes off now!",2
RICHARD,Lower your voice.,2
LORELAI,No! I am a grown woman and you will treat me the way you treat people who have invited you to their house or you will not be invited again.,2
RICHARD,Invited?,2
LORELAI,Yes!,2
RICHARD,Don't you think I know why you invited me here?,2
LORELAI,Because - .,2
RICHARD,"Because your mother asked you too. She called you up and said I was driving her crazy, and would you please take me off her hands for one day so she can get some peace. Isn't that true?",2
LORELAI,No.,2
RICHARD,"You have never once invited me to your house Lorelai, never. And I can hardly point to an event that would prompt you to do so except my recent employment situation.",2
LORELAI,"Okay Dad, Mom did call me but - .",2
RICHARD,"You know, I never thought about retirement. I never thought about what I would do or what I would be once I wasn't working. I never once imagined that I would go from being a productive memb er of the human race to a decrepit old drone sitting at the club at three in the afternoon drinking brandy and playing cards.",2
LORELAI,"Aw, Dad.",2
RICHARD,,2
JESS,Nice picture.,2
RORY,"Gee, thanks.",2
JESS,"You're very popular right now. I bet if you burn a few books, they'll probably make you mayor.",2
RORY,This is ridiculous.,2
JESS,"I don't know, bet you have a lot of supporters on this. Pat Buchanon, Jerry Falwell, Kathie Lee Gifford.",2
RORY,Bye.,2
JESS,"Aw, come on, it's a little funny.",2
RORY,"No, being the poster girl for censorship is not a little funny. The only videos not behind that curtain are Bambi and Dumbo. I mean, they actually had a meeting earlier about whether or not Babe should be behind the curtain so as not to offend people who keep kosher.",2
JESS,It's a crazy world we live in.,2
RORY,And where did they even find that stupid picture?,2
JESS,"Oh no, the picture's good. It's the people who are stupid.",2
RORY,I'm never gonna be able to leave my house again.,2
JESS,"Well, at least you won't starve.",2
RORY,I can't look at it anymore.,2
JESS,Relax. I don't think it'll be around very long.,2
RORY,Why?,2
JESS,Just a guess.,2
RORY,Jess!,2
JESS,Enjoy the food.,2
RORY,Come back here.,2
JESS,Why?,2
RORY,I'll give you an eggroll.,2
JESS,Yes?,2
RORY,What did you do?,2
JESS,Nothing much. Just wanted to make sure whoever rented Dumbo or Bambi gets a little surprise.,2
RORY,What kind of surprise? What did you do?,2
JESS,You owe me an eggroll.,2
RORY,,2
EMILY,"Richard, there you are, sneaking in like that.",2
RICHARD,Hello Emily.,2
EMILY,It's nice to see you.,2
RICHARD,"Well, you seem very happy.",2
EMILY,"Well, I had a very nice day. Would you like a drink?",2
RICHARD,"Uh, no thanks.",2
EMILY,"I saw Cheeky Lennox today. She's redoing her entire house and I have to say, it's given me a few ideas about this place. I won't scare you with them tonight but I'm very excited about it.",2
RICHARD,Well I'm glad.,2
EMILY,,2
RICHARD,Very nice.,2
EMILY,"Sugar and spice, a little crazier than I usually wear but I don't know, I was just in that kind of a mood. So how was your day with the girls?",2
RICHARD,Wonderful.,2
EMILY,Tell me ab out it.,2
RICHARD,"Well, I saw the town, I saw Lorelai's work.",2
EMILY,Did you eat? Because I can have Heloise whip up something for you.,2
RICHARD,"No thank you, we had Chinese food.",2
EMILY,"Oh, you love Chinese food!",2
RICHARD,Yes I do.,2
EMILY,Well I'm thrilled that you had such a wonderful time. It was good for you to get out like that.,2
RICHARD,"Yes it was. In fact, I'm still a little energized from the day, so I think I'm finally gonna organize all those stamps that I've been talking about for ages.",2
EMILY,Now?,2
RICHARD,Why not?,2

LORELAI,So I've decided I'm saving myself for William Holden.,2
RORY,"Wow, it's nice out here in left field.",2
LORELAI,"Hey, I'm sorry. Sunset Boulevard was on last night, and I don't know I've known him for years   Sabrina, Stalag 17   and yet last night something snapped.",2
RORY,I'll say.,2
LORELAI,I think it was the monkey scene.,2
RORY,"You know he's dead, don't you?",2
LORELAI,The monkey?,2
RORY,William Holden!,2
LORELAI,"Ugh, every great relationship has its obstacles. You'd know that if you weren't dating Andy Hardy.",2
RORY,This one?,2
LORELAI,"Hm, no.",2
RORY,Why?,2
LORELAI,"It's too big, it raises expectations.",2
RORY,Like there's actually a home-cooked lunch in there?,2
LORELAI,Instead of whatever is leftover in our refrigerator - exactly.,2
RORY,"Okay, going back on the pile now.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, it's quaint, isn't it? The women get to make a nice lunch basket, the men get to bid",2
onPosted,"02/16/02 20:38it, and the world rotates backwards on its axis.",2
RORY,I think it's fun.,2
LORELAI,That's because you have a pretty boy to bid on your basket.,2
RORY,Yes I do.,2
LORELAI,Did you tell him to eat lunch first?,2
RORY,"Hi, I love him, of course. Hey, I'm gonna look in the back.",2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,"Oh please, I bought my basket weeks ago.",2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,"Well, I'm getting that itch again.",2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,"Well, need   no, but want   that's a different story. Listen darling, do you happen to have change for a dollar?",2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,I don't know where my quarters go.,2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,"Oh no, a quarter would be insulting.",2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,"Oh, thank you so. . . ugh!",2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,"Oh no no , that's okay.",2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,It is?,2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,"Oh, uh, well, it's a very nice picture.",2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,I'm a stalker?,2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,"Or when, in my daily travels, I run across a nice single guy...",2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,I like to have a visual aid to help me with the wonderful buildup I give you.,2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,You're such a beautiful girl and you deserve a nice guy.,2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,But you're no good at finding him.,2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,"Oh, all right.",2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,Stubborn girl.,2
DEAN,Not that one.,2
RORY,You get no say in the basket.,2
DEAN,I have to bid on it.,2
RORY,And you have to eat what's inside it and you get no say in that either.,2
DEAN,Hey.,2
RORY,Yeah?,2
DEAN,Is Taylor behind me?,2
RORY,No.,2
DEAN,What? Taylor? Jess.,2
JESS,Sorry to intrude.,2
DEAN,Then why did you?,2
JESS,"Well, you're having your vertical From Here to Eternity moment right in front of the super glue.",2
RORY,Oh.,2
JESS,Not that that's not an appropriate place to be doing it in front of but - .,2
DEAN,Here's your glue.,2
JESS,Thanks. As you were.,2
DEAN,I really hate that guy.,2
RORY,He didn't do anything.,2
DEAN,"He's here, he's breathing, that's enough.",2
RORY,I really wish you two could start over.,2
DEAN,Why?,2
RORY,Because he lives here and we run into him. He goes to school here. I just think it'd be easier.,2
DEAN,"I'm fine with the whole hating him thing, thank you.",2
RORY,I just think it's a waste of energy.,2
DEAN,"You know, I'll have a PowerBar.",2
RORY,"Fine, forget it.",2
DEAN,"So, uh, I should probably get back to work. We still on for tonight?",2
RORY,I don't know. I might be baking.,2
DEAN,"I'll pick you up at seven. Get that one, it's nice and small.",2
RORY,Bye.,2
RORY,God!,2
JESS,,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,So Patty has taken it upon herself to find me a man.,2
SOOKIE,Oh really?,2
LORELAI,Yes. Here in my hand I have the pictures and resumes of the top three contenders.,2
SOOKIE,Anyone good?,2
LORELAI,"No, but two of them have run with the bulls. This is so humiliating. I can find my own man.",2
SOOKIE,She just loves you.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, but . . .you know, ew!",2
SOOKIE,Ugh.,2
JACKSON,Sookie?,2
SOOKIE,"Jackson, don't look!",2
JACKSON,What?,2
SOOKIE,Cover your eyes!,2
JACKSON,"Okay, okay. I'm sorry, now why am I doing this?",2
SOOKIE,Because I'm baking for the picnic tomorrow and it's supposed to be a surprise.,2
JACKSON,"Oh sure, never see a pie before an auction, it's bad luck.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, uh, you guys talk, I have to go call Patty and stop the forced mating process. I feel like Ling-Ling the panda bear. Oh, hey, one of them's seen Ghostbusters 124 times. Can you say score?",2
SOOKIE,"Okay, what's up?",2
JACKSON,"Well. . . I'm sorry, can I put my hand down? I need to look at you when I talk.",2
SOOKIE,"Uh, hold on. Go.",2
JACKSON,I got a call from my landlord today reminding me that my lease is up at the end of this month.,2
SOOKIE,Uh huh.,2
JACKSON,"So, of course, he wanted to know whether I was gonna re-up it or not.",2
SOOKIE,Uh huh.,2
JACKSON,But I told him that I had to talk to you first.,2
SOOKIE,Okay. About what?,2
JACKSON,About re-upping my lease.,2
SOOKIE,Mm hmm.,2
JACKSON,So what do you think?,2
SOOKIE,About re-upping your lease?,2
JACKSON,Yes.,2
SOOKIE,"Well, you have a very nice kitchen.",2
JACKSON,"Yes, I know.",2
SOOKIE,"And I like your living room. Though that house across the street has sort of that creepy Miami Beac h blue, which means that during the day you really can't look out your window, but at night it's not so bad.",2
JACKSON,"Sookie, forget about the house across the street.",2
SOOKIE,"Well, if you forget about the house across the street, I don't see why you shouldn't.",2
JACKSON,You don't?,2
SOOKIE,Nope.,2
JACKSON,"Oh, okay, fine. Um, I just wanted to check with you first.",2
SOOKIE,"Oh, I appreciate that.",2
JACKSON,"So, um, I guess I'll go re-up my lease then.",2
SOOKIE,Sounds good.,2
JACKSON,,2
LORELAI,You know what's wonderful about this festival?,2
RORY,"No, what?",2
LORELAI,"That it always falls on the day after trash day. Therefore, all the stuff that you forgot to throw out that you would normally be stuck with for another whole week, you can instead put in a pretty basket and auction off for charity.",2
RORY,That is wonderful.,2
LANE,"Okay, I've got it all worked out.",2
RORY,Tell please.,2
LANE,"Well, I invited my cousin David to come and bid on my basket, you know, to keep my mother happy.",2
LORELAI,Uh huh.,2
LANE,"Then when he gets it, we tell my mom we're gonna go eat over at the park where Henry's gonna call on the pay phone at exactly two o'clock for the  all is clear' sigh. Then David, with the twenty bucks I give him, will disappear, Henry will arrive, and we'll finally have out first official date.",2
LORELAI,My head is spinning.,2
LANE,"Stash this at Miss Patty's for me, okay?",2
RORY,Don't you need this for David to bid on?,2
LANE,"Oh no, my mom packed that one. You know, homemade granola, wheat grass juice, soy chicken taco.",2
LORELAI,Suddenly our lunches are looking pretty good.,2
LANE,"This is the Henry basket. I went by Gianelli's and stopped in and picked up a couple of meatball heroes and some chips. I also packed a change of clothes, makeup, makeup remover, and three temporary tattoos.",2
LORELAI,"Sure,  cause four would be trashy.",2
LANE,"I gotta go. I gotta sneak back into my house. Oh, I'm so excited!",2
LORELAI,,2
TAYLORory,Sold for fifteen dollars to the man in the yellow. Thank you very much. Now the next basket I have here is a lovely green wicker number that would be a charming addition to any room once the lunch is gone. Let's start the bidding at five dollars. Do I hear five?,2
DAVID,Five dollars.,2
TAYLORory,"Okay, I have five dollars. Do I hear ten?",2
KIRK,Ten dollars. Withdrawn.,2
TAYLORory,"Okay, I'm still at five, do I hear ten? Five going once, five going twice, sold to the young man for five dollars. You know what's nice, you can put a couple of extra rolls of toilet paper in there and stick it someplace in the bathroom   decorative and convenient. Now this next one may not look like much ...",2
RORY,Mine.,2
LORELAI,Nice.,2
TAYLORory,... but rememb er people   good things come in small packages.,2
LORELAI,How badly does he want to be hosting a game show?,2
RORY,"Hm, he can taste it.",2
TAYLORory,Let's start the bidding at three dollars.,2
RORY,Hey!,2
DEAN,Five dollars.,2
TAYLORory,Now that's the kind of bidding we want to hear today.,2
LORELAI,He's good. He's very good.,2
TAYLORory,"Five dollars, do I hear ten dollars?",2
JESS,Ten dollars.,2
TAYLORory,"Okay, I have ten dollars. Do I have fifteen?",2
JESS,Twenty.,2
TAYLORory,"Twenty dollars, do I hear twenty-five?",2
DEAN,Thirty.,2
TAYLORory,"Okay, see, you boys don't seem to understand the way this thing works.",2
JESS,Forty dollars.,2
DEAN,Fifty dollars.,2
TAYLORory,"Excuse me, have either of you noticed how tiny this thing is?",2
JESS,Seventy-five.,2
TAYLORory,"Now we're not talking cents gentlemen, we're talking dollars remember.",2
LORELAI,Uh oh. Dean's hesitating.,2
DEAN,Eighty.,2
RORY,He does not have eighty dollars to spend on that basket.,2
TAYLORory,Eighty? Eighty dollars?,2
JESS,Ninety.,2
TAYLORory,"Ninety dollars, is that correct?",2
LORELAI,"You know, I don't think he'll have to.",2
TAYLORory,"Okay, we've got ninety going once, ninety dollars going twice. . . sold to the nice young hoodlum in the back for ninety dollars.",2
LORELAI,"I'm trying to think, uh, in what scenario this situation could be construed as positive.",2
RORY,Well . . .,2
LORELAI,"Well, no one's head's on fire.",2
RORY,I better go talk to Dean.,2
LORELAI,Do you want some help?,2
RORY,"No, it's okay. I'm just officially not a fan of unpredictability.",2
LORELAI,I totally understand. Good luck.,2
TAYLORory,"Five dollars on this one, do I hear five dollars?",2
MAN,Five!,2
TAYLORory,"Five dollars, that's good. Thanks you, how about ten dollars?",2
MAN,I'll go ten!,2
TAYLORory,Ten dollars - let's keep going. Look at the size of this . . .,2
DEAN,I'm gonna k*ll him.,2
RORY,"Dean, he was probably just fooling around or something.",2
DEAN,"No, he was messing with me.",2
RORY,I don't - .,2
DEAN,"He was messing with me an d it's the last time, I swear to God.",2
RORY,"Dean, calm down.",2
DEAN,Why would he do this?,2
RORY,Maybe he was hungry.,2
DEAN,He's trying to make me crazy.,2
RORY,Just don't let him.,2
JESS,"I gotta tell you, of all the nutty barn raising shindigs this town can cook up, this one wasn't half bad.",2
DEAN,Glad you enjoyed it.,2
JESS,Yes I did. So shall we?,2
DEAN,Shall we what?,2
JESS,Shall we go?,2
DEAN,Go where?,2
JESS,Go eat.,2
DEAN,Excuse me?,2
JESS,"The person who buys the basket wins the company of the person who makes the basket for lunch. Basket, basket maker, guy who didn't bring enough money.",2
DEAN,You think this is funny.,2
JESS,"Well, it's no Lenny Bruce routine but it has its moments.",2
DEAN,Bye Jess.,2
JESS,Where you going?,2
DEAN,You're the one who's going.,2
JESS,"Oh, as soon as Rory is ready.",2
DEAN,She's not going with you.,2

DEAN,Shut up.,2
RORY,Dean.,2
DEAN,What?,2
RORY,Well ,2
DEAN,"Oh, come on!",2
RORY,It's tradition.,2
DEAN,I don't believe this.,2
RORY,It's true. My mother and I have been doing this every year since we moved here.,2
DEAN,So buck tradition.,2
RORY,Are you kidding? Do you rememb er how mad Taylor was when I was sick and I couldn't go to the turkey-calling contest?,2
DEAN,"This isn't school, you're not getting graded.",2
RORY,Just don't make this into a big thing.,2
DEAN,Don't go.,2
JESS,"Oh geez man, she's not shipping off to  Nam.",2
DEAN,You SO need to shut up now.,2
RORY,"Look, Dean, it's a picnic, it's lunch. We'll sit, we'll eat, it's over.",2
DEAN,No.,2
RORY,What do you think's gonna happen?,2
JESS,"Yeah, I think I'd like to hear this one also.",2
DEAN,I don't want you to go.,2
RORY,Dean!,2
DEAN,"Fine, forget it, go.",2
RORY,Please don't walk away like that.,2
DEAN,"Sorry, I'd do a silly walk but I'm not feeling very John Cleese right now.",2
RORY,"Dean, this isn't my fault. I didn't ask him to do that, I didn't tell him to do that. Dean, you're my boyfriend. I would never do anything to hurt you.",2
DEAN,,2
TAYLORory,"Going once, going twice. . .sold for twenty-five dollars! Congratulations. Thank you. Oh Lord, will you look at this? Ladies and gentlemen, now this is a basket.",2

KIRK,Ten dollars.,2
ANDREW,Fifteen dollars.,2
TAYLORory,I have fifteen dollars.,2
KIRK,Twenty dollars.,2
TAYLORory,"Twenty dollars, I have twenty dollars. Is that my final offer?",2
KIRK,"All right, fine, twenty-five.",2
TAYLORory,"Kirk, you just offered twenty, you upped your own bid.",2
SOOKIE,"I m sorry, can we stop the bidding for just a second?",2
TAYLORory,"Sookie, you know the rules.",2
SOOKIE,"Yes, but I   .",2
TAYLORory,We have twenty-five dollars. Do I hear thirty?,2
SOOKIE,Jackson.,2
ANDREW,"Thirty, if there's pie.",2
TAYLORory,There are no contingencies Andrew.,2
KIRK,Thirty-five.,2
TAYLORory,Andrew?,2
SOOKIE,Jackson?,2
ANDREW,I'm not going any higher without the promise of pie.,2
TAYLORory,"Thirty-five going once, thirty-five going twice. . .sold to Kirk for thirty-five dollars.",2
KIRK,"Yes, finally! You know, if it hadn't have been for me I could've had it for twenty-five.",2
SOOKIE,"Hey, what is wrong with you? I gave you all the signals. The pointing, the waving, the mouthing  That's my basket.' Didn't you see the mouthing?",2
JACKSON,"Yes, I saw the mouthing.",2
SOOKIE,"Well, why didn't you bid?",2
JACKSON,I don't know. It just didn't feel right.,2
SOOKIE,"What are you talking about, it didn't feel right? I made four kinds of pesto and three different desserts. Plus the entire basket is an edible pretzel with a goat cheese filling.",2
JACKSON,"Well, I hope Kirk enjoys it.",2
SOOKIE,I don't understand.,2
JACKSON,"Oh, come on Sookie.",2
SOOKIE,What?,2
JACKSON,"I told you that the lease was up on my apartment, and I asked you if you thought that I should renew the lease on my apartment and you said yes!",2
SOOKIE,Do you not like that apartment?,2
JACKSON,"No, I love that apartment. It's perfect, the ultimate bachelor pad. It's just big enough for one.",2
SOOKIE,Oh.,2
JACKSON,"Only here's the thing. You and I, we've been dating for awhile and I don't know, I thoughtthings were going pretty well.",2
SOOKIE,Things are going really well.,2
JACKSON,"Okay, so I had this crazy thought that since things were going really well that maybe it was time to take a step forward.",2
SOOKIE,You wanted to move in together?,2
JACKSON,"Well, I at least wanted to consider moving in together.",2
SOOKIE,"Oh, uh, I hadn't even thought about it.",2
JACKSON,You hadn't?,2
SOOKIE,"Well, no.",2
JACKSON,"Oh, my mistake then. I thought we were on the same wavelength. We weren't, no problem, enjoy your lunch.",2
SOOKIE,"Jackson, I lied. I have thought about it - a lot. Our bathroom's gonna be pink. I'm sorry.",2
JACKSON,"Well, why didn't you say something?",2
SOOKIE,"I didn't want to ruin anything. We're doing so well, we have so much fun, it's all working.",2
JACKSON,Why would living together mess all that up?,2
SOOKIE,I don't know. We'd see each other every day.,2
JACKSON,We see each other every day now.,2
SOOKIE,And you'd find out all my annoying little quirks.,2
JACKSON,"Hey, I've got annoying quirks too, you know.",2
SOOKIE,I know.,2
JACKSON,What's that supposed to mean?,2
SOOKIE,And you might get sick of me.,2
JACKSON,Or you might get sick of me.,2
SOOKIE,"No, that's not gonna happen.",2
JACKSON,"Well, if that's not gonna happen, then what's the problem?",2
SOOKIE,The problem is that Kirk is gonna eat my goat cheese basket.,2
JACKSON,"Not if I have anything to say about it. How's that for not getting sick of you? Now if you'll excuse me, I got a basket to get.",2
TAYLORory,"Next up   why, that looks like a Doose's market basket. Nice, huh?",2
LORELAI,"Ooh, that's mine.",2
TAYLORory,I'd like to start the bidding at five dollars. GUY 1: I bid five dollars.,2

PATTY,"Well darling, you can't be trusted to do it yourself.",2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,That one's a snorkler.,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,"Luke! Where is he, where is he? I need him! Caesar, where is - agh, agh, thank God. Hey, hey, you gotta come w ith me.",2
LUKE,"What are you doing? Hey hey, I got plates here!",2
LORELAI,"Put the burgers down. Caeser, you're in charge.",2
LUKE,Now wait.,2
LORELAI,"Do you have money? I need money. Which one opens this thing? Is it that one, not that one.",2
LUKE,Stop messing with that.,2
LORELAI,"Luke, you gotta come out there with me. Patty gave my picture out to all these guys because she thinks I need a man.",2
LUKE,"You do, one with a nice couch and a deep knowledge of Freud.",2
LORELAI,You have to come out and bid on my basket.,2
LUKE,Are you serious?,2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
LUKE,I have never in my life taken part in one of these crazy group flip outs. I'm not about to start now.,2
LORELAI,But - right now - out there   the -.,2
LUKE,Just buy your own basket.,2
LORELAI,I cannot buy my own basket.,2
LUKE,Why not?,2
LORELAI,Because that is pathetic.,2
LUKE,And chasing me ar ound my diner begging me to buy your basket?,2
LORELAI,"Also pathetic. But that is a pathetic I can live with, where that pathetic is a truly pathetic pathetic, and only you can save me from the double pathetic! Please!",2
LUKE,I can't believe I'm doing this.,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,"Go, go on.",2
LUKE,"Forty-seven dollars, are you kidding?",2
LORELAI,Luke! GUY 2: Forty-seven fifty!,2
LUKE,For what? Two stale Pop Tarts and a Slim Jim?,2
LORELAI,"Okay, you're not getting the whole saving me here thing, are you?",2
LUKE,Fine. Forty-eight. GUY 1: Forty-eight fifty.,2
LUKE,Forty-nine. GUY 2: Forty-nine fifty.,2
LUKE,"Uh, fifty-two fifty. GUY 1: What? We're just supposed to go to fifty.",2
LUKE,I have a life.,2
LORELAI,Fifty-two fifty going once!,2
TAYLORory,"Hey, hey, that's my job! Fifty-two fifty going once, fifty-two fifty going twice . . .",2
LORELAI,"Oh, please God.",2
TAYLORory,Sold for fifty-two fifty.,2
LORELAI,"Yes! Ha, ha, sorry guys, don't feel bad. I'm totally into Dungeons and Dragons. You've skated.",2
TAYLORory,"And that, ladies and gentlemen, concludes the basket bidding for today. Victors come claim your prizes and your dates. Let the lunching begin!",2
LORELAI,You rock!,2
LUKE,Thank you.,2
LORELAI,You're welcome.,2
LUKE,So what do we do now?,2
LORELAI,I guess we eat.,2
LUKE,This?,2
LORELAI,Yeah.,2
LUKE,"First I have to buy it, then I have to eat it?",2
LORELAI,"Hey, the basket of botulism does come with my company.",2
LUKE,Huh. You don't eat with your mouth open do you?,2
LORELAI,Women don't eat at all. We just look at food and jump on the treadmill.,2
LUKE,"All right, let's go.",2
JESS,"You know, there's nothing there.",2
RORY,"Yes, I know.",2
JESS,You going after him?,2
RORY,Not right now.,2
JESS,"So then, shall we?",2
RORY,,2
JACKSON,I've been looking all over for you.,2
KIRK,Any idea what this is?,2
JACKSON,"Uh, yeah, it's a pineapple cranberry chutney.",2
KIRK,Ech.,2
JACKSON,"Listen, I'd like to talk to you about this basket. As you know, Sookie made it and since Sookie and I are seeing each other, naturally she assumed that I would bid on it.",2
KIRK,Where are the carrot sticks? Every lunch has carrot sticks.,2
JACKSON,"But see, I was a little upset about a fight we had had, and so I didn't bid on the basket.",2
KIRK,"I love carrot sticks, especially the crinkle cut kind.",2
JACKSON,"However, we just made up and now I'd like to have lunch with Sookie, so. . . I need the basket.",2
KIRK,This is my basket.,2
JACKSON,"Yes, but I'd like you to give it to me so that I can have lunch with Sookie.",2
KIRK,I bought this basket. The rules are whoever bids the highest gets to keep the basket.,2
JACKSON,"Yeah, I understand the rules but - .",2
KIRK,"I bid the highest, I bought the basket, I get the basket.",2
JACKSON,"Okay Kirk, I'll pay you for it. I'll give you forty-five dollars, that's ten dollars more than you paid for it.",2
KIRK,No.,2
JACKSON,"Okay, fifty dollars.",2
KIRK,No.,2
JACKSON,"Kirk, this is insane. I'll buy you another basket.",2
KIRK,I don't need you to buy me an other basket. I won this one. You can't just come by and take it away. Just because you have a girlfriend and she made this basket for you doesn't give you the right to bully those of us who don't have girlfriends or anybody to make a basket for them.,2
JACKSON,"Well, I wasn't trying to bully you.",2
KIRK,"Not this year, not last year, not the year before that.",2
JACKSON,Okay Kirk.,2
KIRK,My mother didn't even make one for me.,2
JACKSON,"Oh, that's very sad.",2
KIRK,She made one for all my brothers and sisters but not for me.,2
JACKSON,"That's terrible, Kirk.",2
KIRK,"Twelve brothers and sisters, the only one without a basket   me.",2
JACKSON,"Okay Kirk, what's it gonna take?",2
KIRK,Two hundred and fifty dollars.,2
JACKSON,"Kirk, you're kidding me.",2
KIRK,Twelve brothers and sisters.,2
JACKSON,Will you take a check?,2
KIRK,With two forms of ID.,2
JACKSON,"I swear, you better be as pathetic as you sound.",2
KIRK,,2

DAVID,Three o'clock.,2
LANE,"I don't understand, Henry should've called by now. Give me some change. Oh my God, it's not working!",2
DAVID,"Great, can I have his lunch now?",2
LANE,,2
LORELAI,We're supposed to be eating on the ground.,2
LUKE,Says who?,2
LORELAI,Every picture you've ever seen of a picnic shows people eating on the ground.,2
LUKE,"Yes, and every time I have seen a picture of people eating on the ground I've thought, what the hell are you people doing sitting on the ground? Spring for some beach chairs, you cheapskates.",2
LANE,"Hey Lorelai, do you have your cell phone?",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, is everything okay hon?",2
LANE,I just need to make a call.,2
LORELAI,Here you go.,2
LANE,I'll be right back.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, where are you going?",2
LUKE,"I am going to the diner, I am going to get us some edible food and I'm gonna bring it back here for us to eat.",2
LORELAI,That is so not the point of today. I made this. I am insulted. I will now proceed to pout.,2
LUKE,I'll bring back some brownies.,2
LORELAI,"Ooh, the pouting has left the building.",2
HENRY,Hello?,2
LANE,"Hello, Henry?",2
HENRY,"Lane, I've been trying to call you.",2

LANE,"What, you what?",2
HENRY,I called your house and your mother answered.,2
LANE,What did you say?,2
HENRY,"I asked for you and then she asked why, and I said because and she said because why, and I got nervous and tried to sell her a subscription to the Wall Street Journal.",2
LANE,"Oh, were you successful?",2
HENRY,Lane.,2
LANE,"Sorry, but at least she doesn't know, right?",2
HENRY,I guess not.,2
LANE,"Okay, then we're still good. Can you meet me now?",2
HENRY,I don't know.,2
LANE,"I know it's later than we planned, but we still have a little time and I saved your lunch from David.",2
HENRY,David?,2
LANE,"My cousin, the decoy.",2
HENRY,"Oh, right.",2
LANE,"So we'll rendezvous where I told you. Just drive by, honk twice, go around the block, and the second time you pass I'll jump in the car.",2
HENRY,"Gee, do you even want me to slow down?",2
LANE,"Well yeah, of course. I mean, not to a total stop -.",2
HENRY,"Lane, I don't think this is gonna work out.",2
LANE,What,2
HENRY,"This - you, me.",2
LANE,Are you breaking up with me?,2
HENRY,How can I break up with you? I've never been out with you.,2
LANE,"Well yeah, but that's what today was supposed to be, a date.",2
HENRY,A date where we need a secret plan and a two-honk driveby and a decoy cousin?,2
LANE,"Well, yeah.",2
HENRY,"Lane, I like you but I want to be able to actually pick you up, stop the car, and take you out. And I wanna be able to call you, at your house.",2
LANE,"I'm gonna tell my mother, I promise.",2
HENRY,When?,2
LANE,Soon.,2
HENRY,"Yeah. Look, I've got prom coming up and my friends and I are gonna rent a limo to take us there and I wanna go, and I wanna take a date.",2
LANE,"Well, I'm sure I can figure something out. Maybe Rory can   .",2
HENRY,I asked somebody else.,2
LANE,Oh.,2
HENRY,"I'm sorry, I just figured you'd never be able to go and - .",2
LANE,"No, it's okay, that's good. You should've asked someone else.",2
HENRY,I do like you Lane.,2
LANE,"Okay, well, thank you, I appreciate that. I have to go.",2
HENRY,,2
KIM,"David came by here fifteen minutes ago, said you ran off somewhere! Where did you run?",2
LANE,,2
KIM,Who is he?,2
LANE,,2
KIM,The boy you ran off to see! The one who calls here pretending to work for the Wall Street Journal!,2
LANE,,2
KIM,"You know the rules, no boys! Not unless I approve and I don't approve!",2
LANE,,2
KIM,"I know, I know! You're sneaking, you're lying, that means something's wrong with this boy!",2

JESS,Where do you wanna eat?,2
RORY,Don't care.,2
JESS,Okay.,2
RORY,Where are you going?,2
JESS,Thought you didn't care.,2
RORY,I'm not jumping in the lake.,2
JESS,"No underwater dining, got it.",2
RORY,Now what?,2
JESS,Now we sit.,2
RORY,Here?,2
JESS,Yup.,2
RORY,"On the bridge, that's where we're gonna eat?",2
JESS,Yup.,2
RORY,Okay.,2
JESS,"Yeah, I like this place.",2
RORY,Wow. A place in Stars Hollow you actually like. I'm stunned.,2
JESS,It's got some good memo ries. You see right over there?,2
RORY,Yup.,2
JESS,That's where Luke pushed me in .,2
RORY,Huh.,2
JESS,Yeah.,2
RORY,It's nice.,2
JESS,It is.,2
RORY,So why'd you do it?,2
JESS,Do what?,2
RORY,Outbid Dean like that.,2
JESS,"I don't know. I guess it started as a joke just to bug him, but then he just got so mad, you know? And he is so tall, and I just was looking at him and he's standing there all tall and mad and Ijust. . .I don't know. It was. . .it was really funny.",2
RORY,It wasn't funny.,2
JESS,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I didn't intend to do it. Does that make you feel any better?",2
RORY,I just don't wanna be in a fight with Dean.,2
JESS,"I'm sorry about that. You wanna push me in the lake? It's cathartic, I hear.",2
RORY,"Hm, maybe in a little.",2
JESS,Whatever. So why don't we open this thing?,2
RORY,Go ahead.,2
JESS,Wow. Not one thing in here that I would remotely consider eating.,2
RORY,"Well, I didn't make it for you. I made it for Dean.",2
JESS,And Dean would've eaten this?,2
RORY,"Yes, he would have.",2
JESS,Dean is an idiot.,2
RORY,Dean never would've fallen for that.,2
JESS,"Ah, ha ha.",2
SOOKIE,I can't believe he wouldn't take your check.,2
JACKSON,"Well, apparently, I don't look like my picture.",2
SOOKIE,He's a loon.,2
JACKSON,Yeah. It's okay. I'm paying him off in weekly installment in crinkle cut carrot sticks.,2
SOOKIE,I'm glad we made up.,2
JACKSON,"Yeah, me too.",2
SOOKIE,"And you know, if you still wanted to talk about, you know, what we were talking about, we could talk about it now.",2
JACKSON,"Hmm, nah.",2
SOOKIE,Excuse me?,2
JACKSON,I don't know. I'm having second thoughts.,2
SOOKIE,You are?,2
JACKSON,"Yeah. I mean, living together - big deal, right?",2
SOOKIE,"Oh right. Big deal. Who cares? Not me. No siree, Bob. So, I'm sorry, you don't think we should live together anymore?",2
JACKSON,Nope.,2
SOOKIE,Okay.,2
JACKSON,I think we should get married.,2
SOOKIE,What?,2
JACKSON,I think we should get married.,2
SOOKIE,"But   uh, but. . .",2
JACKSON,Soon.,2
SOOKIE,Are you pregnant?,2
JACKSON,What do you say? Sookie?,2
SOOKIE,"Yes! I say yes. Oh my God, we're getting married! You do know that this means we'll have to live together, right?",2
JACKSON,Yes I do.,2
SOOKIE,"Okay, good.",2
LORELAI,"You know, your burgers actually taste better outside.",2
LUKE,"Good. Next time the roof in the diner's leaking, I'll just rip the stupid thing off.",2
LORELAI,"So this is nice, huh? Come on, admit it.",2
LUKE,Never.,2
LORELAI,"What? Admit it, you would much rather be sitting out here than inside working.",2
LUKE,The diner's probably on fire by now.,2
LORELAI,You are stubborn.,2
LUKE,I'm stubborn?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, you're stubborn.",2
LUKE,You're Miss Flexibility over here?,2
LORELAI,"Hey, I can be flexible.",2
LUKE,Please.,2
LORELAI,"I can. As long as everything is exactly the way I want it, I'm totally flexible.",2
LUKE,"Ah, well, my mistake.",2
LORELAI,Do you want a fry?,2
LUKE,You want a carrot?,2
LORELAI,Impossible.,2
LUKE,Right back at ya. So let me as k you something.,2
LORELAI,"Napkin, please.",2
LUKE,Who did you want to get your basket?,2
LORELAI,What?,2
LUKE,"I mean, before you knew Patty was gonna put you on the Dating Game, you did pack this disgusting lunch and bring it out here, so who did you want to get it?",2
LORELAI,"Well, last year Roy Wilkins bought it and I got my sprinklers fixed for half price.",2
LUKE,Uh huh.,2
LORELAI,"And this year my rain gutters are completely clogged, and I thought if I could get the Collins kid to bite, I'd get that taken care of.",2
LUKE,Very practical.,2
LORELAI,I thought so.,2
LUKE,So the participation in this thing was purely for home improvement reasons?,2
LORELAI,"Yes. And I don't know, it's a nice concept.",2
LUKE,What is?,2
LORELAI,"Just having someone who you love or have some kind of crazy crush on bid on your basket and then share a romantic lunch, it's a nice concept.",2
LUKE,"Well, I'm sure someday you'll manage to find the right guy and drag him out to this thing and make him by your stupid basket and then you'll be sitting out here with him.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, someday.",2
LUKE,You know what?,2
LORELAI,What?,2
LUKE,This is nice.,2
DEAN,I have to talk to you.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, okay. I'll be right back.",2
LUKE,I'll be right here.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, how're you doing?",2
DEAN,"Uh, I'm not great.",2
LORELAI,"Aw, Dean, it's just a silly town thing.",2
DEAN,"I know, and I've been telling myself that and I tried to go home and forget about it, but I can't. I'm worried about Rory. I don't think she should be hanging out with this guy.",2
LORELAI,"Well, I know that today was kind of a. . .",2
DEAN,"It's got nothing to do with today. I mean, yes, it has a little to do with today but it's more than that. Ever since I've met him, I've had this feeling that he was bad news.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, Jess has a few issues.",2
DEAN,"Yeah, one issue is that he's a complete jerk. I mean, he's always getting in fights at school. That is, when he bothers to show up at all. And he's just. . . I don't know. And now this whole thing with Rory, it's like he's always around.",2
LORELAI,You sound jealous.,2
DEAN,"I'm not jealous. He just. . . she has to be nice to everyone, you know?",2
LORELAI,"I know. But hon, that's Rory.",2
DEAN,"Well, he's gonna get her into trouble. I can feel it, I just know it. And he doesn't care about her, he's just using her to drive me crazy.",2
LORELAI,"Dean, you love Rory, right?",2
DEAN,Yeah.,2
LORELAI,"So, part of love is trust. You just have to trust her.",2
DEAN,"I do trust her, it's - .",2
LORELAI,"Him, I know. But flying off the handle like this is not gonna get you what you want. She cares about you, she's not gonna do anything to mess things up with you guys. I know this.",2
DEAN,I hope you're right.,2
RORY,Ten.,2
JESS,Ten?,2
RORY,"Yeah but I didn't understand a word of it, so I had to reread it when I was fifteen.",2
JESS,I've yet to make it through it.,2
RORY,Really? Try it. The Fountainhead is classic.,2
JESS,"Yeah, but Ayn Rand is a political nut.",2
RORY,"Yeah, but nobody could write a forty page monologue the way that she could.",2
JESS,"Okay, tomorrow I will try again, and you will. . .",2
RORY,"Give the painful Ernest Hemingway another chance. Yes, I promise.",2
JESS,"You know, Ernest only has lovely things to say about you.",2
RORY,Why are you only nice to me?,2
JESS,Excuse me?,2
RORY,An hour ago you were totally screwing with Dean and now you're totally nice to me.,2
JESS,"You see, it's the screwing with Dean - that's an important step to getting here so that I can be nice to you.",2
RORY,So it was a plan.,2
JESS,What?,2
RORY,"The whole bidding on my basket, it was a plan.",2
JESS,"Okay, I'm officially starving.",2
RORY,And officially evasive.,2
JESS,"Come on, I'll get you a pizza.",2
RORY,Answer my question.,2
JESS,Do you like pepperoni?,2
RORY,"Not going to, are you?",2
JESS,We can just get it on half if you want.,2
RORY,"Okay, I give, let's go.",2
JESS,,2
RORY,Mom?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, hey. Where've you been? I thought Taylor auctioned you off to the highest bidder.",2
RORY,"No, I just went to get some pizza and I, uh, wandered around the bookstore for a little while. Here.",2
LORELAI,What's this?,2
RORY,You said you wanted to read the Children's Hour.,2
LORELAI,I did?,2
RORY,"The other night when we were watching Julia, and Jane Fonda was playing Lillian Hellman.",2
LORELAI,"Oh yeah, and I made the Hellmann's mayonnaise joke.",2
RORY,Which no one ever needs to hear again.,2
LORELAI,"Right, right. Well, thanks.",2
RORY,You're welcome.,2
LORELAI,So who were you with?,2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,"Pizza, book buying - did you have company?",2
RORY,"Oh, yeah.",2
LORELAI,Who?,2
RORY,"Um, Jess.",2
LORELAI,Jess?,2
RORY,Yeah.,2
LORELAI,Right.,2
RORY,"So, I'll be in my room.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, good.",2
LORELAI,So how was the picnic?,2
RORY,Fine.,2
LORELAI,Good. Did you get the Dean issue resolved?,2
RORY,Not yet. He's coming over later and we're gonna smooth things over hopefully.,2
LORELAI,"Aw, yeah, well, smoothing's good. I love the smoothing. So, how was it with Jess?",2
RORY,Fine.,2
LORELAI,"Well obviously, the pizza and the books. So good, that's. . .I'm glad.",2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,What what?,2
RORY,"Well, you look like you have something to say.",2
LORELAI,I have nothing to say. I never have anything to say.,2
RORY,"Yes, that is your reputation.",2
LORELAI,"It's. . .I don't know. I'm just surprised that you're hanging out with him, that's all.",2
RORY,Why?,2
LORELAI,He doesn't seem like the nicest kid.,2
RORY,"Well, you don't know him.",2
LORELAI,"No, I guess not.",2
RORY,You're just judging him by that one time that he came over here.,2
LORELAI,"Which, by the way, was not a rousing success.",2
RORY,"He had just moved here. He was mad at his mom. Trust me, he's got a really good side to him. You'll see it eventually.",2
LORELAI,"Good, I can't wait.",2
RORY,Mom.,2
LORELAI,"No, well, I'm sorry. It's. . I just, uh, I don't know. From the things I've seen and the things I hear. . .",2
RORY,Like what things?,2
LORELAI,"The vandalism, the stealing, the cutting school, the fighting.",2
RORY,How do you know about the fighting?,2
LORELAI,"Well, Dean told me.",2
RORY,Dean?,2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
RORY,You've been discussing this with Dean?,2
LORELAI,"No, he discussed it with me.",2
RORY,When?,2
LORELAI,"Today. Rory, he's really upset about this.",2
RORY,So he went running to my mother?,2
LORELAI,"Well, he needed someone to talk to.",2
RORY,"Well, he could've talked to me.",2
LORELAI,"No, he couldn't  cause you were off with Jess.",2
RORY,You're taking his side?,2
LORELAI,"I'm not taking sides here, okay? I'm Swiss, babe.",2
RORY,I wasn't off with Jess. I. . .Jess outbid him.,2
LORELAI,I know.,2
RORY,"Well, the rule is that if one person outbids someone else, then. . .",2
LORELAI,"Rory, this is not about the rule. I know what the rule is. This is about Dean being concerned that you're hanging out with someone who can get you hurt.",2
RORY,How could Jess get me hurt?,2
LORELAI,"I don't know, hon. In the short amount of time he's been here, he's managed to make a lot of enemies.",2
RORY,"I'm sorry, when did I move to Salem?",2
LORELAI,"People are concerned about you, you know? You're young and naïve and you think that everyone has some good inside if you give them a chance.",2
RORY,So you're saying that Jess is no good?,2
LORELAI,I've known guys like Jess. He seems cool because he's got this dangerous vibe and this problem with authority and he's seen a lot of Sylvester Stallone movies.,2
RORY,Oh my God.,2
LORELAI,"But guys like this get into trouble which, if you hang out with them, gets you into trouble and I don't want you to get into trouble.",2
RORY,"I'm sorry, are we talking about Dean still or are we suddenly talking about you?",2
LORELAI,"Hey, I've been there, okay? You haven't.",2
RORY,"Been where? I mean, we got pizza, we looked at some books. God, I can't even believe that I'm having this conversation with you. I mean, with you of all people. I mean. . . I don't even want to talk about this anymore.",2
LORELAI,Rory.,2
RORY,"No, I'm going for a walk.",2
LORELAI,"Uh, Dean is gonna be here any minute.",2
RORY,,2
EMILY,"A cigar club. Can you imagine a more disgusting organization to join? Your grandfather now pays money to sit in an enclosed room with a bunch of other men and blow smoke in each other's faces. Twice a week he comes home smelling like a flophouse. So I finally just confronted him. I said,  Richard, I know you're going through a transitional period here and I encourage your trying out new things, but this seems completely out of character for you.' I'm sorry, am I boring you?",2
LORELAI,"No, you're not.",2
RORY,Sorry Grandma.,2
EMILY,So how are things at the inn?,2
LORELAI,"Fine, the same.",2
EMILY,"And Rory, how's that boyfriend of yours?",2
RORY,Apparently very chatty.,2
EMILY,"Well that's nice. Lorelai, anything new with you?",2
LORELAI,"No, nothing. It's been pretty quiet around the house lately.",2
EMILY,"Well, sometimes quiet can be nice. Soothing. You can hear yourself think. All right, what's going on with you too?",2
LORELAI,Nothing.,2
EMILY,"It's not nothing. You've both been sitting here all night, not saying a word and not even looking at each other. Are you in a fight?",2
LORELAI,I'm not.,2
RORY,Please.,2
LORELAI,Please what? You are the one who's been freezing me out all week.,2
RORY,I just haven't had anything to say.,2
LORELAI,Who is it?,2
RORY,No one.,2
LORELAI,Why won't you tell me w ho?,2
RORY, Cause it's no one.,2
LORELAI,Is it Jess?,2
RORY,"You're kidding, right?",2
EMILY,"Jess, who's Jess?",2
LORELAI,"No, I'm not kidding.",2
RORY,Why would you automatically assume that it's Jess?,2
LORELAI,Because why won't you tell me who it is?,2
EMILY,Who's Jess?,2
LORELAI,Luke's nephew.,2
RORY,"It's not Jess, okay? It's Dean. You wanna read it? Oh wait, no. Dean will probably tell you all about it later.",2
LORELAI,"That's not funny. You know, all week you've been - .",2
RORY,We're not getting into this again.,2
EMILY,What? Getting into what? Is it about this Jess the thing you're not getting into again?,2
RORY,"You know, you never liked Dean at the beginning.",2
LORELAI,That's because I didn't know him.,2
RORY,And now you don't like Jess?,2
LORELAI,That's because I know him.,2
EMILY,Are you dating Jess? What happened to Dean?,2
RORY,I'm not dating Jess.,2
LORELAI,"No, but he's trying to weasel his way in.",2
RORY,He's not trying to weasel his way.,2
EMILY,In where?,2
LORELAI,"In Rory's world. He has his eye on her, and he's trouble.",2
RORY,He's not trouble.,2
LORELAI,Yes he is.,2
EMILY,"Rory, if your mother thinks this boy isn't appropriate company for you then you need to listen to her.",2
LORELAI,"There, thank you Mom.",2
RORY,,2
KIM,"Kim's Antiques, we're closed, call tomorrow.",2
RORY,,2
KIM,It's after nine.,2
RORY,,2
KIM,Lane can't talk after nine.,2
RORY,,2
KIM,"Okay, just this once.",2
RORY,,2
KIM,Lane?,2
LANE,,2
KIM,Phone.,2
LANE,,2
KIM,"It's okay, it's Rory.",2
LANE,,2
KIM,Rory?,2
RORY,,2
KIM,"Lane's not feeling well, she needs to call you tomorrow.",2
RORY,,2
KIM,,2
KIM,It's early for you to be in bed.,2
LANE,,2
KIM,Come downstairs and have some tea.,2
LANE,,2
KIM,"I know you're upset but I have these rules for a reason. I'm your mother, I know what'sbest for you.",2
LANE,,2
KIM,"You see, this is exactly why I make these rules. You're too young, too vulnerable. American boys have different values, they don't understand respect, you get hurt. I do all of this so you don't get hurt and now here you are hurt. I don't like this, I don't like this at all. Who is he, this boy who hurt you?",2
LANE,,2
KIM,Cho?,2
LANE,,2
KIM,Cho sounds Korean.,2
LANE,,2
KIM,He was Korean?,2
LANE,,2
KIM,And   and you're sure he was Korean?,2
LANE,,2
KIM,A doctor.,2
LANE,,2
KIM,Maybe I can call his mother.,2
LANE,,2
KIM,,2
LORELAI,"I swear Mom, there's just something about that kid that. . .ugh, I don't know. And I hate it because he's Luke's nephew and Rory likes him but. . .",2
EMILY,"You are her mother Lorelai. You must set boundaries and restrictions, it's your job.",2
LORELAI,"I wanted to like him but I just couldn't, and Rory can't see it.",2
EMILY,"Well, she's young.",2
LORELAI,And she won't take my word for it.,2
EMILY,"Well, she's young.",2
LORELAI,I don't know what to do. Maybe I'm overreacting.,2
EMILY,"Lorelai, listen to me. Now I don't say this to you very often, but on this matter I happen to agree with you one hundred percent.",2
LORELAI,"Gee, thanks Mom.",2
EMILY,"I know Rory's a good girl, but good girls can go bad with the wrong influences. We all know that.",2
LORELAI,"Oh no no, I don't think Rory's actually gonna go bad.",2
EMILY,"Don't back down Lorelai. You took a stand and you are completely in the right here. You absolutely must keep her from that boy. If you need to change her curfew, lock her up, throw away the key, whatever it takes to make sure she doesn't go astray - you do it. Her judgment cannot be trusted here. She's a young girl and knows nothing. You are her eyes and her ears and her brain for as long as it takes to make sure she doesn't make any ridiculous choices in her life.",2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,"Hey, can I come in ?",2
RORY,"It's not my house, I can't stop you.",2
LORELAI,"Just listen to me for one second okay? No sighing, just let me talk.",2
RORY,Go ahead.,2
LORELAI,I don't wanna lock you up and throw away the key.,2
RORY,Well good.,2
LORELAI,"Your judgment means something, especially to me. I can't be your eyes and your ears and your brain.",2
RORY,I'm trying really hard to connect the dots here.,2
LORELAI,I got spooked. I know it violates the fabulous cool mom clause we're supposed to have going but I did and I'm sorry.,2
RORY,It's okay.,2
LORELAI,"Now, I am concerned about Jess.",2
RORY,"Well, you shouldn't be.",2
LORELAI,"But I am. However, you are a smart girl, you're a good judge of character, and the fact that he seems to like you gives him a couple of brownie points. You're not a little kid. I don't actually think you ever were a little kid.",2
RORY,"I was, for about a month.",2
LORELAI,"If you think he's a decent guy, I have to respect your judgment.",2
RORY,Thank you.,2
LORELAI,But I'm asking you to be careful.,2
RORY,I will.,2
LORELAI,Really careful.,2
RORY,I will.,2
LORELAI, Boy in the plastic bubble' kind of careful.,2
RORY,I promise.,2
LORELAI,And you have to cut Dean some slack. He's so crazy about you. He didn't mean anything by coming to me. He just wigged.,2
RORY,I know.,2
LORELAI,"So, fight over?",2
RORY,Fight over.,2
LORELAI,Good.,2
RORY,You still don't look okay.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, well, my mother agreed with me tonight.",2
RORY,I'm so sorry.,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,I need a shower.,2
RORY,Don't be so dramatic.,2
LORELAI, I agree with you a hundred percent.' Ugh!,2
RORY,Go upstairs.,2
LORELAI,"Find a movie, I'll be down in a minute.",2
RORY,Okay.,2
LORELAI, I agree with you a hundred percent.' I may have to shave my head also.,2
RORY,Bye.,2
JESS,,2
RORY,Hi.,2
JESS,Hi.,2
RORY,What are you doing?,2
JESS,"Nothing, you?",2
RORY,Nothing.,2
JESS,Why'd you call?,2
RORY,"I . . um, I wanted to. . .",2
JESS,I'm glad you called.,2
RORY,Yeah?,2
JESS,Yeah.,2
RORY,Why?,2
JESS,Because maybe you can explain what the hell this crazy woman is talking about.,2
RORY,"Ah, The Fountainhead.",2
JESS,"Yes. Your fault, and you will pay.",2
RORY,"I promise. Commit to it one more time and if it still is awful for you, I will make it up to you.",2
JESS,Oh yeah?,2
RORY,Yeah.,2

LORELAI,"But my question is, how did that happen? How was it that suddenly everyone in the world was saying  music has charms to soothe the savage beast' when it was written breast.",2
RORY,I don't know. At some point someone misspoke and it just caught on.,2
LORELAI,How do things like that catch on?,2
RORY,"Mom, please, you're driving me crazy.",2
LORELAI,"I mean, did some guy like say it at a big rally of some sort and everyone went home and started saying it that way and then it just spread from there?",2
RORY,"Yes, exactly.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, now you're just trying to shut me up.",2
LORELAI,Oh my God.,2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,Look.,2
RORY,Wow.,2
LORELAI,Empty.,2
LUKE,"Just one of those weird lulls, happens occasionally.",2
LORELAI,Ugh.,2
RORY,Can we sit wherever we like?,2
LUKE,Wherever you like.,2
Posted,02/24/02 03:10,2
RORY,Wow.,2
LORELAI,Such luxury I never dreamed of.,2
RORY,Where do you wanna sit?,2
LORELAI,"I don't know. Um, how  bout this table with it's unobstructed westward view of the wide cosmopolitan expansive Klump Street?",2
RORY,Tempting. Do you know that on a clear day you can see all the way to the garbage cans behind Al's Pancake World?,2
LORELAI,"Hm. Or we could sit in the corner - you know, the Mafia table so that no one can come up behind you and whack you with a cannoli.",2
RORY,"Whack you with a cannoli? Oh, because he left the g*n and took the cannoli.",2
LORELAI,You're so my daughter.,2
LUKE,Aye aye aye.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, let's sit at the counter.",2
RORY,"Nah, the counter, those are not the power seats.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, but with no one here we can sit at either end and play bagel hockey.",2
RORY,"Ooh, bagel hockey! Oh boy!",2
LUKE,Just sit at a table.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, you're awfully rude for a guy who only has two paying customers.",2
RORY,"Okay, 3:30 on Friday - my debate at Chilton. Write it down.",2
LORELAI,Already written.,2
RORY,Good.,2
LORELAI,Are you prepared?,2
RORY,Please. Paris has us beyond prepared. I now know more about doctor assisted su1c1de then I ever cared to.,2
LORELAI,Cheery topic,2
LUKE,Luke's. Uh huh. Hold on a second. It's for you.,2
RORY,What?,2
LUKE,Yup.,2
RORY,But who knows we're here?,2
LORELAI,This whole morning has been a little Twilight Zone-y.,2
LUKE,Or Outer Limits-y.,2
LORELAI,What?,2
LUKE,"Great show, just as eerie, same era, but no one ever references it.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, I'm sorry, I don't speak geek.",2
LUKE,"Yup, stepped right in it.",2
RORY,Hello?,2
LANE,Rory?,2
RORY,Lane. How did you know I was here?,2
LANE,Telescope. I got a clean shot at Luke's. I saw you and your mom go in.,2
LUKE,"Hey, watch it.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, duck Harvey.",2
RORY,"So I guess you're still grounded over that whole Henry thing, huh?",2
LANE,Are you kidding? It's the mother of all groundings. My mom's done everything but slap a Dr. Dre ankle bracelet on me. I'm not even going to school.,2
RORY,Isn't it illegal to keep a kid out of school?,2
LANE,"Well, she talked all my teachers into allowing me to be home-schooled for two weeks. I believe the words  highly contagious' were batted about. I only get five minutes a day of outside phone time but unlimited time to call the Psalm a Day line. A big ripoff, by the way, because psalm 79 has been on there for three straight days. That's not in keeping with what their name clearly implies, which is a new psalm per day, every day. Not the same tired one from the previous two days.",2
RORY,I've never heard anyone get so riled up about psalms before.,2
LANE,"My world has become very small. Okay, I'm dying for news. Give me some headlines.",2
RORY,"Oh, well, I've got a debate coming up. And, um, Dean's been working extra hours lately saving up for a new motorcycle, so I hardly see him. Mom and I haven't done laundry in three weeks, but I have taken to jumping into the gigantic pile of dirty clothes while we play our Reader's Digest World's Famous Polka CD that we got used for ninety-nine cents. Sorry if that's all boring.",2
LANE,,2
KIM,"Lane, come down for your snack!",2
LANE,"It's tea and melba toast time, gotta go. Don't forget me in my solitude.",2
RORY,Never.,2
LANE,Bye.,2
RORY,Think fast.,2
LORELAI,"Whoa, impressive. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?",2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,Goalie for the bagel hockey team?,2
RORY,And bump Schmitty?,2
LORELAI,"Schmitty's over the hill, he's washed up, put him in Cooperstown. Suit up kid!",2
LUKE,,2
RORY,There's nothing on.,2
LORELAI,There's always something on. Uh! Struck gold!,2
RORY,Not Two Fat Ladies again.,2
LORELAI,Why not? They're brilliant.,2
RORY,Because it's a cooking show and you don't cook.,2
LORELAI,That might change.,2
RORY,Not a chance.,2
LORELAI,Probably not.,2
RORY,"Plus, we've seen all of them like five times. They're all repeats.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, sadly because one of the fat ladies met her maker.",2
RORY,Really? Which one?,2
LORELAI,The fat one.,2
RORY,"Come on, which one? The one on the motorcycle or the one in the sidecar?",2
LORELAI,"See, it's fun just talking about the Two Fat Ladies.",2
RORY,Can't we find some other really fat people to watch?,2
LORELAI,"Wow, that sounded really insensitive.",2
RORY,Paris.,2
PARIS,Can I come in ?,2
RORY,I guess. So?,2
PARIS,You couldn't possibly be wondering what I'm doing here.,2
RORY,I couldn't?,2
PARIS,The debate's Friday and we need more preparation.,2
RORY,More preparation? Paris -- no two people know more about assisted su1c1de than the two of us. Kevorkian called today for a couple of tips.,2
PARIS,I know we know the material but there's issues of presentation that need to be addressed.,2
RORY,Presentation?,2
PARIS,I was listening to the CD I burned of the cassettes I made of our mock debates against the make-believe team and I realized that you were not talking fast enough.,2
RORY,What?,2
PARIS,You're only doing 135 wpm.,2
RORY,Wpm?,2
PARIS,Words per minute.,2
RORY,Of course.,2
PARIS,That's slow.,2
RORY,That's not slow.,2
PARIS,It's Jimmy Bob slow.,2
RORY,I talk normally.,2
PARIS,"For the average Willie Nelson roadie, yes, but not for a winning debate team member. As a comparison, I speak an average of 178 wpm.",2
RORY,"Okay, word speed isn't everything. Sometimes I will add a dramatic pause to prove a point, undercutting my wpm.",2
PARIS,"Let's not harbor any Pinteresque fantasies here, Rory. We'll have scant minutes to make our arguments and we have to maximize our collective wpm.",2
RORY,"Okay, okay. Let's just get going.",2
LORELAI,Hey Paris. Were we expecting you?,2
PARIS,You should've been. I'm going to get set up.,2
RORY,We're going to my room to work on my wpm.,2
LORELAI,Do I wanna know?,2
RORY,No.,2
LORELAI,I'll get it! Hello?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Hey Lor, it's Chris.",2
LORELAI,"Hey you, how's it going?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Good, good. I'm on a little business trip here and I thought I'd call and check in on Rory.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, she went to some biker party a few days ago and never came back.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Again?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, we gotta start disciplining that girl.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Hey, who's got the time?",2
LORELAI,"Actually, she's right here. I'll pass you to her. So where'd this business trip take you?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Your neck of the woods, actually. I'm in the Litchfield area.",2
LORELAI,Really? How long?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"I don't know, a couple of days, or for as long as it takes for them to succumb to my infinite charms.",2
LORELAI,"Well, if you're still here on Friday, you should come on down and see Rory in a debate at Chilton.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Really?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah. It starts at 3:30 and it's first come, first serve. They're expecting like 20,000 people so I'd get there early.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Wow, Chilton up close, huh?",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, it's your chance to see the famous Paris in action. There might even be casualties.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Okay, tell Rory I'll be there.",2
LORELAI,Really?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Why not?,2
LORELAI,"Aw, she'll be excited. Here, tell her yourself.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Pass me on.,2
PARIS,"Dairy's bad too because of the mucous. You haven't had any dairy in the last forty-eight hours, have you?",2
RORY,In my cereal this morning.,2
PARIS,"Geez! Okay, well there's a solution of salt water and vinegar that can help cut that.",2
LORELAI,"Girls, I'm sorry to interrupt vinegar hour, but it's your dad.",2
RORY,"Dad, hi.",2
PARIS,Did you give her the cereal?,2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,Hello?,2
LANE,It's me.,2
RORY,"Lane, this is flat out stalking.",2
LANE,"Look, I don't have much time. I've already used up my five minutes of phone time so this is totally illicit, but I have to talk to you. There's a new Belle and Sebastian single coming out today.",2
RORY,I know.,2
LANE,I have to have it.,2
RORY,"Okay, well -.",2
LANE,"No, I mean I have to have it.",2
RORY,I don't know if I have time to pick it up.,2
LANE,"What? Rory, do you wanna hear how I used up my five minutes of phone time today? Talking to Amazon.com trying to get them to overnight it to me in a plain package with a return address referencing something Korean and religious.",2
RORY,"They wouldn't do it, huh?",2
LANE,I think they notified the government.,2
RORY,Can't you just wait for your grounding to be over?,2
LANE,"Hey, I am a fanatic audiophile. That comes with responsibilities that a grounding doesn't alter. Now, I have to have this single and you have to figure out how to get it to me.",2
RORY,"Okay, okay, I'll do my best.",2
LANE,"Thank you, I have to go. Oh, and hey.",2
RORY,What?,2
LANE,You've got something in your teeth.,2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,"Hey, there you are. Where were you?",2
RORY,"Oh, hi.",2
LORELAI,"I thought we were gonna meet by the vending machines for a little, uh, pre-debate nondairy snack.",2
RORY,"Yeah, sorry, Paris wanted to do a sound check and she found some problems with the acoustics in the room.",2
PARIS,"It's the layout on this row of seats that's causing a bass problem. We've got to move this whole row over a foot. Esta! Just move these people out. Mueva esta gente, mueva, mueva!",2
RORY,Better find a seat before she moves them all.,2
LORELAI,Have fun.,2
RORY,Thanks. I'm glad you came.,2
SOOKIE,No you're not!,2
RORY,What?,2
SOOKIE,I'm just getting you in the mood.,2
LORELAI,So do you see Christopher anywhere?,2
SOOKIE,"Uh, well, no, no, no. Hey, what does he look like?",2
LORELAI,"If you don't know, why are you looking?",2
SOOKIE,"I'm looking for a guy that looks like a guy that you could be with, only I'm deducting seventeen years off his age and I'm adding an all-boys private school uniform and a Yankees cap.",2
LORELAI,And does your head hurt?,2
SOOKIE,,2
MALLEY,"If everybody could please take their seats, we'll begin. That includes all thememb ers of the debate team.",2
RORY,"Brad, hi.",2
BRAD,Hi Rory. I didn't think you'd remember me.,2
RORY,"Oh, of course I do. How's the new school?",2
BRAD,I love it. It's way more mellow there and I made a ton of new friends.,2
RORY,Good for you.,2
PARIS,"Well, Brad.",2
BRAD,Paris.,2
PARIS,"Guess we're going mono a mono today, huh?",2
BRAD,,2
MALLEY,"All right, the topic for today's debate is doctor-assisted su1c1de.",2
SOOKIE,That's pleasant.,2
MRS,O',2
MALLEY,"Let me in troduce the debaters. On the Hillside Academy team, we have Brad Lankford and Nancy Waterford.",2
NANCY,You look sick.,2
BRAD,,2
MALLEY,"And on the Chilton team, we have Rory Gilmore and Paris Gellar.",2
LORELAI,Oww!,2
SOOKIE,Whoo!,2
LORELAI,Oww!,2
SOOKIE,Were we not supposed to do that?,2
LORELAI,,2
MALLEY,"Each team will have three minutes for their openings, three minutes for rebuttals, and two minutes for their conclusions. They will be judged on the basis of content, strategy, and style. I will be the judge, along with Mrs. Gladstone.",2
PARIS,Mrs. O'Malley is impregnable but yesterday I complemented Mrs. Gladstone's dumpy outfit and bought her an ice cream sandwich and she practically licked my hand in gratitude.,2
RORY,,2
MALLEY,We choose which team will take the pro or con side with the toss of a coin. A memb er of Hillside will make the call.,2
BRAD,,2
MALLEY,"Uh, it's heads. Chilton will pick pro or con.",2
PARIS,Pro assisted su1c1de.,2
BRAD,,2
MALLEY,"All right. Whenever you're ready, you may commence.",2
PARIS,Thank you. Keep it snappy.,2
RORY,"There are many vantage points from which to consider doctor assisted su1c1de. Serious consideration draws from ethics, law, medical practices, philosophy, psychology, public policy and religion, all topics I plan to explore in the next two minutes and forty-six seconds.",2
LORELAI,"Geez, look at that kid, he's shaking.",2
SOOKIE,"Ooh, and pale.",2
LORELAI,He looks all white and tiny.,2
RORY,,2
PARIS,"And referencing their last point, which erroneously cited South Carolina as a state that has neither a statute nor common law which prohibits assisted su1c1de when we know that North Carolina is the proper citation, their subsequent argument falls short of even a level of speciousness due to the fact that it doesn't even have a ring of factual truth, let alone a substance. And after all, the absence of prohibition against assisted su1c1de is a far cry from a statute that actually legitimizes the practice, a state of affairs that exists only in Oregon, sadly enough, under the 1977 Death Without Dignity Act.",2
LORELAI,"Hey, circus lady, what's with the contortions?",2
SOOKIE,I'm trying to sneak a peak at the girl Christopher's with.,2
LORELAI,"But you see, the entire concept behind the word sneak is not having people notice you, and what you're doing is shouting  notice me.'",2
SOOKIE,Tell me you're not curious.,2
LORELAI,I'm not curious.,2
SOOKIE,You are too.,2
LORELAI,,2
MALLEY,Two minutes for conclusion.,2
LORELAI,Ooh.,2
SOOKIE,You sneak a little peak?,2
LORELAI,Shh.,2
PARIS,,2
MALLEY,Time.,2
PARIS,,2
MALLEY,"That's it, time's up.",2
PARIS,"Oh, but if I could just have a few seconds to rebut their charge of the cruelty of the act.",2
BRAD,We take it back!,2
PARIS,,2
MALLEY,"Okay, that's enough cruelty for one day, Paris. Your team has won. Congratulations.",2
PARIS,Really? Thank you. Thank you very much. You put up a good fight. Better luck next time.,2
RORY,You okay?,2
BRAD,I'm sweating. I'm completely soaked through. And I think I'm catching a cold.,2
RORY,Do you need a hug? Or a towel?,2
BRAD,"No, thanks. I think I'm just gonna sit here quietly.",2
SOOKIE,Uh! There they are.,2
LORELAI,I see them. What do you think?,2
SOOKIE,She's got good hair.,2
LORELAI,Yeah.,2
SOOKIE,Plus she's been sitting for an hour and her dress is perfect. Not a wrinkle? How does she do that?,2
LORELAI,She must be a witch.,2
SOOKIE,And she's doing that no-hose thing.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah. She's a chic, good hair, wrinkle-free, no-hose-wearing witch.",2
SOOKIE,You ready?,2
LORELAI,Yeah.,2
LORELAI,"Hi there, you two.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Hey Lorelai. You guys get to meet at last. This is. . .,2
LORELAI,Sherry.,2
SHERRY,Nice to finally meet you.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, I recognized you from your Christmas card.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Which I'm sure you mocked mercilessly.,2
LORELAI,"Did not. Others, yes, but not yours. You guys were cute, and the puppy was cute. Hey, this is Sookie.",2
SHERRY,Nice to meet you.,2
SOOKIE,Nice to meet you. You have a very smooth dress.,2
SHERRY,"Oh, well thank you. It's the fabric.",2
SOOKIE,The fabric. Uh huh.,2
LORELAI,"Hm. Uh, Chris, I've told you about Sookie.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Yes you have, the famous Sookie.",2
SOOKIE,The famous Christopher.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,I hear you're the greatest chef after Alan Ducass.,2
SOOKIE,After Alan Ducass? Who   who said after?,2
RORY,Hi Dad! You came.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Of course I did.,2
RORY,"Sorry, I'm still getting used to it. I'm glad.",2
LORELAI,"Honey, um, look who Dad brought.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"This is Sherry. Sherry, this is Rory.",2
SHERRY,"Oh, finally, finally, finally. I am so beyond thrilled, I can't tell you. All he does is talk about you. I couldn't wait to meet this amazing person.",2
LORELAI,"Well, she lives up to the hype, let me tell ya.",2
RORY,Is my face turning red?,2
LORELAI,"Oh yeah, beet red.",2
SHERRY,"Oh, I'm sorry. I put you on the spot. I've just been really looking forward to this.",2
RORY,"No, no, it's okay.",2
LORELAI,"Um, will you excuse us for a minute? Rory just wanted to show me something around the corner here and we'll be right back.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"So Rory was great, huh?",2
SOOKIE,"Brilliant. So, who said I was after Alan Ducass?",2
RORY,He brought Sherry.,2
LORELAI,I know.,2
RORY,This is a little. . .,2
LORELAI,Yeah.,2
RORY,Did you talk to her? Is she nice?,2
LORELAI,She's a witch.,2
RORY,"Oh, good.",2
LORELAI,"So, what do we do?",2
RORY,What do you mean?,2
LORELAI,"Come on, come on, come on. We gotta put on our hostessing hats and set a game plan here.",2
RORY,"Oh yeah, I guess it would be impolite if we didn't ask them to hang out with us.",2
LORELAI,So what do we do? Hit the vending machines?,2
RORY,Invite them to Luke's?,2
LORELAI,Does she look like a diner chick to you?,2
RORY,Probably not.,2
LORELAI,I wish he had told me she was with him.,2
RORY,Where else can we invite them?,2
LORELAI,Al's Pancake World.,2
RORY,"No, it's Friday. He does his prefix menu on Fridays.",2
LORELAI,"Ugh. Well, there's always our house.",2
RORY,It's a mess.,2
LORELAI,Might be the safest?,2
RORY,Okay.,2
LORELAI,Why didn't he mention that she was with him?,2
RORY,I don't know.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,It's really just more of an impression than something I probably actually heard.,2
SOOKIE,But maybe someone implied that I was after him?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, Sookie?",2
SOOKIE,Yeah?,2
LORELAI,"You know what, you are the greatest chef in the world, bar none.",2
SOOKIE,"Uh, thanks.",2
LORELAI,"So, um, are you guys doing anything now?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Not really.,2
SHERRY,"No, we're pretty free for the rest of the day.",2
LORELAI,"Well, why don't you come back and see our place?",2
SHERRY,"Oh, that would be great.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Yeah, Sherry would love that. Thanks Lor.",2
SHERRY,I was hoping we'd get a chance to see where Rory lives and her room.,2
RORY,"Oh, my room's really no big deal.",2
SHERRY,"Oh, and the books. I've heard all about the books. I can't wait to see the books.",2
LORELAI,"Well, let's go and see the books.",2
PARIS,"Rory! So, great job. We pretty much wiped the floor with them.",2
RORY,"Yeah, we turned them into cleaning products, definitely.",2
PARIS,"Listen, the verbatim transcripts of the debate will be ready in about a half hour. I thought we could wait for them and sit and talk about what we did right, what we did wrong, compare wpm's.",2
RORY,"Well, I'm actually heading with my group back to our house, so I really can't.",2
PARIS,,2
LORELAI,"You get the living room, I'll get the kitchen!",2
RORY,What about the upstairs?,2
LORELAI,I'll body block the fool who tries to go upstairs.,2
RORY,Company is stressful.,2
LORELAI,"Ugh, don't forget about your room!",2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,Your room! She wants to see the books!,2
RORY,"Well, I'll hit it next.",2
LORELAI,"Ugh, they're probably gonna want something to eat and drink.",2
RORY,"Well, company usually does.",2
LORELAI,We have nothing.,2
RORY,We must have something.,2
LORELAI,Not unless Divine Providence has placed a miracle brie and cr*cker plate in the fridge.,2
RORY,We have leftover Halloween candy.,2
LORELAI,"Aw, waste that on company?",2
RORY,"Well, having company is about making sacrifices.",2
LORELAI,Martha Stewart?,2
RORY,I paraphrased Proust.,2
LORELAI,I should've known. Fine. Presentation is everything.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Hello?,2
RORY,Hi Dad!,2
CHRISTOPHERory,You guys need some mo re time to clean up?,2
LORELAI,He knows us too well.,2
RORY,Come on in. How'd you know we were cleaning?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Uh, well, when you cut us off in the parking lot and sped off doing sixty, I figured you were trying to beat us home for a reason.",2
SHERRY,I hope we're not completely ruining your day.,2
LORELAI,"Oh no, we love company. Please come in.",2
SHERRY,Your house is great.,2
LORELAI,"Thanks, we like it. Have a seat.",2
SHERRY,"Rory, you were wonderful in the debate today.",2
RORY,Thanks.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Uh, that Paris was a little intense.",2
LORELAI,"Ha, a little? The opposing team could bring her up on w*r crimes.",2
RORY,"Yeah, her approach will come in handy when she becomes a CEO or a dictator of a country or something.",2
SHERRY,"Mm hmm. Well, you were very poised up there, very sure of yourself, just like your dad.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,And your mom.,2
LORELAI,"Aw shucks, Pa.",2
SHERRY,"And your uniform is darling, really. I love the blue. Of course, I'm sure you look good in anything.",2
LORELAI,"Oh yeah, you should see her in chaps.",2
SHERRY,Really?,2
RORY,"No, that was just my mom being funny.",2
SHERRY,Oh.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, it comes and goes. You'll learn to notice the signs.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"The waves get really still, the animals start to act funny.",2
SHERRY,"You know, I went to private school too.",2
RORY,Really?,2
SHERRY,Except that our colors were white and bright red. I looked hideous.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Oh, she's being self-deprecating. You looked cute in that outfit.",2
SHERRY,"No no, I looked like a peppermint stick. I swear, that's where my addiction to clothes comes from. Trying to make up for all the years of having to wear the same thing everyday.",2
RORY,"Yeah, I can understand that.",2
SHERRY,"Well, we should go shopping sometime for clothes or whatever.",2
RORY,"Yeah, we could do that.",2
SHERRY,"Soon, okay?",2
RORY,Sure.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, drinks. Who wants something to drink? I've got water, soda. . .",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Uh, just water for me",2
SHERRY,Me too.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, making it easy, I love it.",2
SHERRY,I'll help you.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, no, uh, well, okay. Sherry, you don't have to help me.",2
SHERRY,"No, I want to.",2
LORELAI,Great.,2
LORELAI,"So, uh, do you want flat water or sparkling? I hope it's flat because I don't have sparkling. Or flat. Or ice cubes. I have cups, I think.",2
SHERRY,"It's a little awkward, isn't it?",2
LORELAI,What?,2
SHERRY,"Us, you and me, our being here.",2
LORELAI,"Aw, no, not really.",2
SHERRY,"But kind of, right?",2
LORELAI,"Well, we're just not used to having company.",2
SHERRY,"I mean, you and Christopher were so close. I know it was years ago but these things are never simple.",2
LORELAI,"Well, just in general, things like this are always awkward slightly, but only slightly. Agh, look. Apple juice - with a perfectly respectable expiration date.",2
SHERRY,"Look, I just want you to know that you should not feel like you need to get to know me.",2
LORELAI,Oh.,2
SHERRY,At all.,2
LORELAI,Okay.,2
SHERRY,"I mean, just because Christopher and I are close doesn't mean that we need to be close, or friends or anything for that matter.",2
LORELAI,"No, I guess not.",2
SHERRY,"I mean, except for our unexpected visit, we may never have even met.",2
LORELAI,I think we probably would've met eventually.,2
SHERRY,"Perhaps, at some function or other.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah - you, me, Martin Sheen all chained to the same tree.",2
SHERRY,But I do desperately wanna get to know Rory.,2
LORELAI,"Well sure, she's a great kid.",2
SHERRY,And that's okay with you?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, that's fine.",2
SHERRY,"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that. Because things are kind of speeding up between me and Christopher and  ",2
LORELAI,Really?,2
SHERRY,Rory is so important to him.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, I know, she is.",2
SHERRY,And he told me ab out how he wasn't really a presence in her life for years and how he'd like to make up for all that time that he wasted.,2
LORELAI,"Well, he's been doing really well lately.",2
SHERRY,"I know. He is obsessive about his call dates to her. I mean, it doesn't matter where we are or what we're doing, he's gotta call Rory Wednesday nights at seven o'clock. I like that about him.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, me too.",2
SHERRY,And he really wants me to bond with her too. It's important with everything we have coming.,2
LORELAI,I totally understand.,2
SHERRY,"Good, I'm glad.",2
LORELAI,Yeah.,2
SHERRY,So what are the chances of Rory and I getting together on this trip?,2
LORELAI,This trip?,2
SHERRY,How about tonight?,2
LORELAI,Tonight?,2
SHERRY,Rory seemed up for it.,2
LORELAI,"Tonight huh? Well, uh, it's kind of last minute and we're supposed to go somewhere.",2
SHERRY,The Friday night dinner with your parents.,2
LORELAI,You know about those?,2
SHERRY,"All about them, but Christopher said that you can get her out of them if there's a pressing need.",2
LORELAI,"Well, that's true to a certain extent but - .",2
SHERRY,"Well this is pressing. I am so forcing myself here it's embarrassing, but that's how important it is. I mean, who knows when this opportunity's gonna present itself again, right?",2
LORELAI,Right.,2
SHERRY,So?,2
LORELAI,"Well, um, sure. You'll have to ask Rory but if it's okay with her, it's okay with me.",2
SHERRY,"You know, you're as great as Christopher said you were.",2
LORELAI,"Well, he's an excellent judge of character.",2
SHERRY,"Okay, I'll see you back out there? Okay.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Everything okay?,2
SHERRY,"Yup, she found apple juice.",2
LORELAI,"Hey Rory, can you get that!",2
RORY,Let the machine pick it up.,2
LORELAI,"No, it could be important.",2
RORY,Okay. Hello?,2
LORELAI,"Hi, it's me.",2
RORY,"Oh, hi.",2
LORELAI,"I'm still in the kitchen. Um, listen, I just wanted to tell you that Sherry just asked me if she could go out with you tonight just the two of you, and she sort of trapped me into saying that I could get you out of the Friday night dinner, which she knew all about. But I told her she had to run it past you first, so I can still get you out of it. Although, it might be a good idea to get a Sherry night out of the way because it seems kind of inevitable. So if you're okay going with her, just say, um,  Sorry Leonard, we've got company, I have to call you back.'",2
RORY,"Sorry Leonard, we've got company, I'll have to call you back.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, okay. Bye. Okay, here's your drink. Who was that?",2
RORY,"Um, that was Leonard.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, did you tell him we have company?",2
RORY,Yeah.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Uh, who's Leonard?",2
RORY,"Oh, just a friend.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,A friend of yours or a friend of Lorelai's?,2
LORELAI,A mutual friend.,2
RORY,"Yeah, it's pretty much equal.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,A mutual Leonard?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, we're constantly fighting over him.",2
SHERRY,"Rory, can I run something by you?",2
RORY,Oh sure.,2
SHERRY,"Your dad and I are around for another night, and he's totally sick of me.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Not true.,2
SHERRY,"Anyhow, I was wondering if you wanted to do something with me tonight, just the two of us.",2
RORY,"Oh, sure, that would be nice.",2
SHERRY,Really?,2
RORY,"Yeah. I mean, um, if it's okay with my mom because we do have a Grandma/Grandpa dinner tonight.",2
LORELAI,It's fine by me.,2
SHERRY,"Great. Oh, of course this does leave you a sad little orphan.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Oh, that's okay. I'll have one of my patented White Castle bachelor dinners.",2
LORELAI,"Or you can come w ith me tonight. Uh, if you want.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,To your parents?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah,  cause with Rory not there I might need a hostage.",2
SHERRY,"Oh, yes, do it.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Okay, it's good grub. You sure they won't be mad?",2
LORELAI,"Hi, they like you.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,True.,2
SHERRY,"Great. Well, we should go get cleaned up for tonight then. Thanks for having us over like this.",2
LORELAI,Any time.,2
SHERRY,So we'll swing by around six?,2
RORY,"Oh, sounds good.",2
SHERRY,Okay.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Bye sweetie.,2
RORY,Bye Dad.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,,2
LORELAI,"Honey, hurry, they said six.",2
RORY,Yeah but it's six Dad time so it's more like six-thirty.,2
LORELAI,But Dad time is now linked to Sherry time and that Sherry seems awfully punctual.,2
RORY,That is so annoying.,2
LORELAI,We have to learn to live with each other's deficiencies.,2
RORY,I'll get it.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, if it's Leonard, tell him I'll call him back.",2
RORY,He's so needy. Hello?,2
LANE,Humongous snag in the CD drop plan.,2
RORY,What happened?,2
LANE,"Bible class has been moved an hour later, all to accommodate the reverend's handball schedule.",2
RORY,The reverend plays handball?,2
LANE,I'm just as appalled. So it's at ten instead of nine.,2
RORY,"Okay, I'll make the necessary adjustments.",2
LANE,"Thank you, thank you, thank you. So, anything new?",2
RORY,My dad brought his girlfriend to my debate.,2
LANE,"The potential stepmom? Oh my God. Tell me what she's like, what'd she say and tell me in like eleven seconds  cause it's all the phone time I have left.",2
RORY,That's too much pressure!,2
LANE,"Well, then write a long descriptive letter about it all and slip it into the CD booklet. Oh, and try to include a candid Polaroid of her if you can.",2
RORY,I'll try.,2
LANE,Gotta go.,2
RORY,Bye.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Hey, can we come in ?",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, come on in. Hey.",2
SHERRY,You look great.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, thanks, you too.",2
SHERRY,"Hi there, you ready to go?",2
RORY,All set.,2
SHERRY,"Okay, so we won't be too late, probably around ten.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, well, if you wanna grab a drink after the movie, Rory's got the list of places that serve minors.",2
RORY,"Nah, I got a flask in my purse.",2
LORELAI,Ooh.,2
SHERRY,"Okay, I'm gonna have to drink a lot of coffee to keep up with you two.",2
LORELAI,"Damn, our secret's been revealed.",2
SHERRY,Bye love.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Have,2
funRORY,Okay.,2
LORELAI,Bye Sweets.,2
RORY,Bye.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,There they go.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, there they go.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Sherry's really excited about this. It's such a great opportunity Lor. Thanks for making it happen.,2
LORELAI,That's what I'm here for. Let me just get my coat and we can go.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Great.,2
LORELAI,Can I just ask you a quick question?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Sure, what?",2
LORELAI,"When I invited you to Rory's debate, was Sherry with you?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Yeah, of course. She's been with me the whole trip. Why?",2
LORELAI,It's just that you gave me no indication that she was with you.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,What? I must have.,2
LORELAI,"Nope, singular pronouns all the way.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,I actually don't rememb er what I said.,2
LORELAI,"I do. You said,  I'll be there', as in just you.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, I may have said that but I wasn't making a point of saying that. It just came out that way.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, whatever, I was just wondering.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"It's okay that I brought Sherry along, isn't it?",2
LORELAI,"Absolutely. It was just a surprise, that's all.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Okay.,2
LORELAI,So you weren't trying to hide the fact?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"No. I mean, obviously you were gonna find out she was with me once we arrived.",2
LORELAI,Obviously.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Okay then.,2
LORELAI,Okay.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,So what do you think of her?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, I don't know her well enough to judge.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, that's never stopped you from judging people before.",2
LORELAI,"Hey buddy, I'm trying to grow here.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, if it helps, she was saying really nice things about you.",2
LORELAI,Really?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Yeah. She said you guys had a really nice talk in the kitchen.,2
LORELAI,"Well, if that's what she said, then I guess we did.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Lorelai, come on.",2
LORELAI,What?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,You're being very cryptic. Did something happen between you two?,2
LORELAI,"No, I just. . .I thought our conversation in the kitchen was a little odd.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,And this is being less cryptic?,2
LORELAI,It's just that she went on and on about how we never have to be friends or get to know each other at all or try to force any kind of relationship.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Really? She never mentioned that part. Huh.,2
LORELAI,So how come she figures she never has to see me?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, I'm sure she was trying to make you feel at ease around her. Because it's true, you guys don't have to force anything.",2
LORELAI,Uh huh. Where'd she get this  don't force it' philosophy?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Not from me.,2
LORELAI,You sure?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Yes, I'm sure.",2
LORELAI,"So she just wants to get to know Rory, not me.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, I did steer her toward bonding with Rory, I'll admit that.",2
LORELAI,But not with me.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Rory's my daughter Lorelai, Sherry has to get to know her.",2
LORELAI,I know.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,I wasn't purposely omitting you or telling her not to interact with you.,2
LORELAI,"Oh good, so you're not having me k*lled or anything like that?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"No. In fact, I was just going over my  people to k*ll' list and I don't think you were on it.",2
LORELAI,"Because by the very fact that Rory exists, I am in the picture.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,You can back off Lorelai. You'll be in Sherry's life.,2
LORELAI,Good.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Not that you thought to do the same thing when you were in my shoes.,2
LORELAI,What? What are you talking about?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"You have a fiancé, I believe.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, Max.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Right, Max.",2
LORELAI,That was not the same thing.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Really? Max knew Rory, Max got close to Rory, right?",2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, he and I never met. I didn't even know he existed until late in the game. Hell, I didn't even know you were engaged until you called me from your bachelorette party. And I wasn't invited to the wedding   or did my invitation get lost in the mail?",2
LORELAI,"Well, you've moved a lot this past year.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,I was never part of that equation.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, maybe. But trust me, you would've been part of the equation eventually. Really Chris, you would have.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,,2
EMILY,Christopher!,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Hello Emily.,2
EMILY,"Well, this is a surprise. Where's Rory?",2
LORELAI,"Uh, a last minute unexpected thing came up, but I brought a good substitute   half her genes in a nice nifty Christopher package.",2
EMILY,"Well, we're letting the freezing air get in. Come in, come in. Is she sick? There are terrible things making the rounds these days.",2
LORELAI,"No, she's not sick. Hi Dad.",2
RICHARD,"Hello Lorelai. Christopher, this is a surprise!",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"A nice one, I hope.",2
RICHARD,A very nice one.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,How are you Richard?,2
RICHARD,You're looking well.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,So are you. You playing a lot of golf lately?,2
RICHARD,"Ah, well, more like it's playing me. Oh, let's not stand here. Come into the living room. Now, who wants a drink? Uh, martini, Manhattan, some scotch?",2
LORELAI,Yes please.,2
RICHARD,"Uh, you wanna narrow that down for me?",2
LORELAI,Hooch is hooch Dad.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,I'll have a Manhattan.,2
EMILY,Same here.,2
RICHARD,Right.,2
EMILY,So you never said where Rory is.,2
RICHARD,Rory's not here?,2
EMILY,"Richard, you didn't even notice your own granddaughter isn't here?",2
RICHARD,"Well, she's so quiet she sometimes slips in unnoticed. She should work for the CIA. Uh, one cherry good for everybody?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Fine with me.,2
EMILY,Me too.,2
LORELAI,Eight please. I'm peckish.,2
EMILY,"Well, I noticed that Rory isn't here.",2
LORELAI,"Well you've got that eagle eye, Mom.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"I'm afraid it's my fault Emily. My girlfriend and I were passing through town and we dropped by Stars Hollow for a visit, and she and Rory are off doing something together.",2
EMILY,You have a girlfriend?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Sherry.,2
EMILY,And she and Rory are out together?,2
LORELAI,"I'm sorry. I should've called, Mom.",2
EMILY,"Well, that would've been thoughtful. I mean, we set a place for her at the table and everything.",2
LORELAI,"Well, Chris is here so it won't go to waste.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Although normally I demand my own customized place setting.,2
EMILY,So how long have you been with this woman?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Eight months.,2
RICHARD,"Mm, I bet she's pretty.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, she's very pretty.",2
RICHARD,"Uh, something in your eye Lorelai?",2
LORELAI,I got it.,2
EMILY,You've met this woman?,2
LORELAI,"Yes, Mom, I met this woman today and she's very nice.",2
RICHARD,"Uh, what does she do? Does she work?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Uh, she's the East Coast sales rep for Loreal Cosmetics.",2
RICHARD,"Hm, that sounds like a lot of responsibility.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Keeps her busy, involves some travel.",2
EMILY,What are they doing?,2
LORELAI,What?,2
EMILY,Rory and Christopher's friend   what are they doing tonight?,2
LORELAI,"Dinner and a movie, something like that. It's my fault that we didn't call.",2
RICHARD,"You work has you traveling too, I hear.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Some.,2
RICHARD,"Everyone thinks that traveling on business is so glamorous but what they don't realize is that the business traveler never gets to see the places he visits. My last trip to Rome, I spent the whole four days in a conference room by the airport. I might as well have been in French Lick, Indiana.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, my trips are mostly local, just me and my Volvo.",2
EMILY,You have a Volvo?,2
RICHARD,"That's new, isn't it?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,I just got it.,2
RICHARD,Excellent choice. It's nice and safe. That's a good family car.,2
LORELAI,It's also excellent for cranking Metallica.,2
RICHARD,Cranking Metallica?,2
LORELAI,Mm hmm.,2
RICHARD,"If that's some sort of drug reference, it isn't funny.",2
EMILY,So you're planning on having a family?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,What?,2
EMILY,With this woman?,2
LORELAI,"Her name's Sherry, Mom, and you're really putting Chris on the spot here.",2
EMILY,"Well, he bought a family car, it's a natural question.",2
LORELAI,Dad called it a family car. I'm sure there's nothing in the sales contract that says you have to have a family in order to buy the car.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Although I didn't read all the fine print.,2
EMILY,"You always drove a motorcycle before, didn't you?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,I still got it.,2
RICHARD,"Oh, oh, a family man shouldn't drive a motorcycle. The accidents I covered for the firm involving motorcycles   the worst, grisly. They use this industrial machine to scrape the victims off the road like a huge spatula.",2
LORELAI,"Hey, mouthful of cherries here.",2
EMILY,So are you living together?,2
LORELAI,"Mom, get out the interrogation lamp, why don't you.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"It's okay. Yeah, but we're looking for something bigger in the Boston area.",2
RICHARD,There are a lot of nice historical places up there.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Something historical in our price range would be perfect.,2
EMILY,"You know historical homes are infested with mold, don't you?",2
LORELAI,Mold?,2
EMILY,It gets inside the walls and grows out of sight and sh**t off spores that slowly k*ll you and your family.,2
LORELAI,"You should get a show on the Home and Garden channel, Mom.",2
RICHARD,"When did you become an expert on mold, Emily?",2
EMILY,It was in the New York Times Magazine. I'd hold off buying a place with this woman until you look into this.,2
LORELAI,"Sherry, Sherry.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, it's actually gonna come down to whatever we can afford. It might just be a newly built place.",2
EMILY,"With their shoddy craftsmanship? Oh, you don't want that.",2
LORELAI,"What does that leave them with, Mom   a teepee?",2
EMILY,I'm sorry. I just don't think that Rory should miss our dinners for something other than sickness or emergencies. That was the agreement.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"I'm sorry Emily, really.",2
LORELAI,"Mom, Chris has apologized like a hundred times. How many more times do you wanna hear it?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Listen, I can call Sherry and have her and Rory come by after their movie, that way it won't be a totally Rory-less evening.",2
EMILY,That's not what I want.,2
LORELAI,"Mom, we're desperately trying to work with you here.",2
EMILY,"Working with me is one thing, patronizing me is another. Excuse me.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,I feel horrible.,2
RICHARD,"Oh, don't son. That's just Emily.",2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,You wanna tell me w hat's going on here?,2
EMILY,How can you let that horrible woman take Rory like that?,2
LORELAI,"Okay Mom, calm down. It's only one night.",2
EMILY,That's how it starts. She's just getting her claws into her.,2
LORELAI,Her claws?,2
EMILY,We'll never see Rory again if that woman has her way.,2
LORELAI,"Mom, hold it. Rory is my daughter, you know. I have some control over this.",2
EMILY,"She's not getting Rory on weekends, you can't let that happen.",2
LORELAI,What is this about Mom? Why are you so flipped out?,2
EMILY,"Lorelai, are you blind or just that humiliated?",2
LORELAI,Humiliated?,2
EMILY,Christopher gets his life together with that woman.,2
LORELAI,"So, that's good.",2
EMILY,It should've been you!,2
LORELAI,What?,2
EMILY,"Don't play dumb, Lorelai. You know it too, and deep down I know you're heartbroken.",2
LORELAI,I'm not heartbroken.,2
EMILY,"Well, I am.",2
LORELAI,Huh.,2
EMILY,"I always had the picture in my mind of the three of you together. After all these years and after all the bad things that happened, Rory with both her parents. And now that Christopher's got his life together, it's with her and not you.",2
LORELAI,"Mom, the timing was never right for us.",2
EMILY,"That's because you dawdled time away. You could've had that affect on him. You could've been the person to help him get his life together, but you made no effort!",2
LORELAI,"Oh, so now this comes down to something I didn't do? Don't put that on me Mother!",2
EMILY,What other explanation is there? He's always been crazy about you but you've always kept him at arms length. You keep everyone at arm's length.,2
LORELAI,That's not true!,2
EMILY,It is true! Your destiny was to be with Christopher and now it's too late!,2
LORELAI,Then it wasn't our destiny!,2
EMILY,"So you're saying that you don't have feelings for him Lorelai, that all of this is just fine with you?",2
LORELAI,That's not important.,2
EMILY,It's not?,2
LORELAI,No. What's important is that Christopher is doing well and he's happy and we should be happy for him.,2
EMILY,,2
LUKE,Hey.,2
LORELAI,Hey.,2
LUKE,You alone this morning?,2
LORELAI,"No, Rory's with me. She just had to run an errand.",2
LUKE,"Well, take whatever table you want.",2
LORELAI,Okay.,2
LUKE,You okay?,2
LORELAI,Yeah.,2
LUKE,You don't seem your chipper self.,2
LORELAI,I brought some sparklers. I'll light them later and do some kicks.,2
LUKE,"You know, if you want I can clear the counter and you can play some bagel hockey.",2
LORELAI,You can't play bagel hockey by yourself.,2
LUKE,I'll play with you. You'll have to explain the rules.,2
LORELAI,It's okay. I'm just trying to recover from last night. It was one of those nights where you start off stepping in quicksand and end up with a sixteen-ton anvil landing on your head.,2
LUKE,I've had plenty of those. I'll bring some coffee.,2
LORELAI,Can't hurt.,2
RORY,You order?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, just coffee. God, I must've been sound asleep when you got home last night.",2
RORY,You were snoring like a buzz saw.,2
LORELAI,I believe that's defined as a superfluous comment.,2
RORY,"Yes, you were sound asleep.",2
LORELAI,"So, I'm dying to hear about your night with Sherry. How was it? Give it to me, A to Z,beginning to end, soup to nuts.",2
RORY,"Well, she is what she seems.",2
LORELAI,Details please.,2
RORY,"She's a very cautious driver. She doesn't roll through stop signs, doesn't speed, she always signals before she turns.",2
LORELAI,"Hm. Commen dable, but not the person I want driving our getaway car.",2
RORY,What are we robbing?,2
LORELAI,Sephora. We had it all planned out.,2
RORY,Slipped my mind.,2
LORELAI,What's her music taste?,2
RORY,Big Bruce Springsteen fan. Seen him like twenty times.,2
LORELAI,Blue collar roots or is she just slummin g?,2
RORY,"Oh, her father owned a shoe store and her mom taught kindergarten.",2
LORELAI,"Wow, you guys really got into some details.",2
RORY,She was definitely in bonding mode.,2
LORELAI,"What else, what else?",2
RORY,"She's very touchy-feely. Hand on the shoulder, lots of hugs.",2
LORELAI,"She didn't try to get fresh, did she?",2
RORY,Gross!,2
LORELAI,Go on.,2
RORY,"Um, she's had one prior serious relationship in her life.",2
LORELAI,"Finally, the juicy stuff.",2
RORY,And it lasted eleven years.,2
LORELAI,Eleven years? And she never got married?,2
RORY,"She said she never thought about it with her career and all, but now she's thinking about it more and more.",2
LORELAI,"Tick tock, tick tock.",2
RORY,"And the past couple of years she hasn't even dated anyone unless she thought that for sure it could be a lasting relationship, and she's got some specific goals now concerning children.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, here we go.",2
RORY,"She wants at least two, and before she met Dad she was seriously considering single parenthood.",2
LORELAI,That's wanting kids.,2
RORY,That's about it.,2
LORELAI,Yeah?,2
RORY,"Oh, she works for Loreal.",2
LORELAI,"Hm, I heard that.",2
RORY,I'm tapped. How was your night?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, well, fine. Just took Mom a whole five minutes before she self-combusted and left the room in tears.",2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,"She freaked out that you were with Sherry, can you believe that?",2
RORY,She freaked?,2
LORELAI,Totally. She kept calling her  that woman'.,2
RORY,"Well, what did she think, that you were gonna come home and find a rabbit boiling on the stove?",2
LORELAI,"No, it had to do with her and Christopher and . . . anyway, eventually she came down and had a pouty dinner.",2
RORY,So it ended up okay?,2
LORELAI,For the most part.,2
RORY,Is she mad at me?,2
LORELAI,"No, the angel child, never.",2
LUKE,Here you go.,2
RORY,Thank you.,2
LORELAI,"Thanks. So, um, I wanna ask you something.",2
RORY,Ask.,2
LORELAI,When you've thought about me and your dad   what have you been thinking all these years?,2
RORY,"Um, what do you mean?",2
LORELAI,"I mean, did you ever picture us potentially together, like  we are family' together?",2
RORY,"Well, not really.",2
LORELAI,"But sort of, it crossed your mind?",2
RORY,I feel like I'm on the Ricki Lake show.,2
LORELAI,"Go Rory, go Rory.",2
RORY,"Well, I'll admit that I have pictured the three of us living together at various times, but in the way that all kids picture their estranged parents living together or the way they should be together, but it's stupid.",2
LORELAI,It's not stupid.,2
RORY,"Yeah, I've pictured it.",2
LORELAI,Hm.,2
RORY,But I also pictured you with Pee-Wee Herman.,2
LORELAI,Wow.,2
RORY,Yeah. We lived in his playhouse and we'd be talking to Chairy and Captain Carl would be walking by.,2
LORELAI,Fun!,2
RORY,"Yeah. Oh, and later I pictured you marrying Matthew Broderick, and we lived in New York in this great apartment in the village and we would talk about his Ferris Bueller days.",2
LORELAI,Just think how easy Producers tickets would be to get.,2
RORY,"Oh, it would be fourth row center every night.",2
LORELAI,"I'm sorry that Matthew and I couldn't work it out, honey.",2
RORY,I'll try to get over it.,2
LORELAI,So should it have been me?,2
RORY,,2
KIRK,,2
KIM,I know you're Kirk. I've known you since you were two.,2
KIRK,,2
KIM,We're in a hurry.,2
KIRK,,2
KIM,"For people who come to buy things, come with cash, it's ten to six, Sunday through Friday. For people who wander around, blocking aisles, touching things with dirty hands, never buying or asking for eighty percent off, we're closed.",2
KIRK,,2
KIM,Yes.,2
KIRK,"Okay, got it, thanks for your time.",2
RORY,"Oh my God. Michel, are you okay?",2
MICHELorelai,I've been running around this stupid square for over an hour.,2
RORY,Why?,2
MICHELorelai,Why? Because the plan was to drop the CD at nine o'clock.,2
RORY,"No, it got changed to ten. I told my mom and she said she'd pass it on. She didn't pass it on, did she?",2
MICHELorelai,Definitely not.,2
RORY,"Oh, well the mission was a success.",2
MICHELorelai,"Yes, my cardiologist will be thrilled. Ah! I've got a cramp, I've got a cramp!",2
RORY,Can I do anything for you?,2
MICHELorelai,"Ah, get away from me ev il girl!",2
RORY,But -.,2
MICHELorelai,"Never will I do anything for you again, ever, ever, never!",2
RORY,"Well if it makes you feel any better, you had really good form.",2
MICHELorelai,You are your mother's child.,2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,Hey you guys.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Hey.,2
SHERRY,We just wanted to say a last goodbye. Rory's not here?,2
LORELAI,She went outside somewhere. You can probably find her.,2
SHERRY,"Oh, okay. I think I will. We had such a great time last night. So I hear your dinner was good?",2
LORELAI,"Uh, yeah, it was great.",2
SHERRY,"I would love to see that house sometime, especially the portrait of Rory in the study. Any way I could get a picture?",2
LORELAI,I can send you one.,2
SHERRY,That would be great! So she's outside?,2
LORELAI,Somewhere.,2
SHERRY,I'm gonna try to corral her.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Yeah, bring her by so I can see her too.",2
SHERRY,Okay. Bye Lorelai. Thanks for everything.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, you're welcome. Bye.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"So, quaint evening of theater last night.",2
LORELAI,"Ah yes, the Gilmore family players rival the Barrymores for their sophisticated, dramatic productions.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,I never thought she'd freak over Rory not being there like that. I never wanted to put you in that position.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, you couldn't have known.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"I mean, Rory's missed the occasional dinner before.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, well, this was compounded by other things.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,What other things?,2
LORELAI,"You should know as well as I that when it comes to Emily Gilmore, it's never simple.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Got it. Ah, looks like they found each other. You know, Sherry had a really good time last night. I hope Rory did too.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, she seemed to.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Good, good.",2
LORELAI,"So Chris, before you go, um, I have something I wanna say to you.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Uh oh.,2
LORELAI,It's not an uh oh.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Okay, what?",2
LORELAI,"Well, I, um, I kind of realized something with you and Sherry visiting and God help me, because of something my mother said to me.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Wow, inspiration can come from the unlikeliest sources.",2
LORELAI,"I was just thinking, you know, all these years, no matter what my relationship status has been, whether I've been dating or hibernating or whatever, I think I've always had you in the back of my mind - you know, the prospect of us being together. But this prospect was sort of indefinitely on hold while you, you know, found yourself and, uh, got your personal life together so that you could really be there for me an d especially for Rory. But you and I have been so linked in my mind that I think I have unconsciously sabotaged every decent relationship I've had, including the one with Max, because I was waiting for you, and I shouldn't have been. And now that I see that, and I see you settling down with Sherry, I think I can move beyond it.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Good, I'm really glad this is good for you Lorelai.",2
LORELAI,It is. Chris?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,How dare you put that on me?,2
LORELAI,I'm just thanking you.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, don't.",2
LORELAI,What's wrong?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"What's wrong? Dammit Lorelai, you're dumping fifteen years of unhappiness on me? Fifteen years of not having healthy, lasting relationships on me? You're blaming me for breaking up with Max and not marrying him? That's all my fault?",2
LORELAI,"No, I just - .",2
CHRISTOPHERory,I did nothing to deserve that.,2
LORELAI,I'm not saying that you did.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,You're as good as saying it.,2
LORELAI,"No, I'm not.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Then what did you expect to come from this divine revelation that you've been so kind to share with me? Did you want me to apologize to you for ruining your life or comfort you and say  there, there, everything's gonna be all right' so you can feel okay? Forget it!",2
LORELAI,"Chris, wait!",2

LORELAI,It still hurts.,2
RORY,Do you need stitches?,2
LORELAI,Probably.,2
RORY,"Well, then we should go to a doctor.",2
LORELAI,"No, no doctors. You go into a hospital, you don't come out again.",2
RORY,"Well said, Ida Morgenstern.",2
LORELAI,I'm starving. I need pancakes.,2
RORY,Can I just ask   .,2
LORELAI,No.,2
RORY,What on earth you thought you were doing?,2
LORELAI,I thought I was being a self-sufficient woman.,2
RORY,"You hate ladders, you hate heights.",2
LORELAI,We needed our rain gutters cleaned.,2
RORY,"Yeah, well, hire somebody.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, well, aren't we suddenly a Rockefeller.",2
RORY,"Well, it's better than you k*lling yourself.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, I'm fine. I'm just being dramatic. It's what I do.",2
RORY,No more ladders.,2
Posted,03/09/02 20:06,2
LORELAI,I promise.,2
RORY,Okay.,2
LORELAI,I think I have gangrene.,2
RORY,You do not.,2
LORELAI,And vertigo.,2
RORY,Oh boy.,2
LORELAI,And one leg suddenly feels shorter than the other.,2
RORY,"This is gonna be the Vanity Fair paper cut incident all over again, isn't it?",2
LORELAI,Wow!,2
RORY,Leave your bandage alone.,2
LORELAI,"Look, it's turning purple, but a really glowy purple. Look!",2
RORY,"No, thanks.",2
LORELAI,"Hm. Maybe our rain gutters are radioactive or made out of some kind of alien metal so that when I cut my hand I got infected with an extraterrestrial substance which is altering my internal makeup. Ugh, maybe I'll turn into a superhero.",2
RORY,Maybe.,2
LORELAI,"Like, maybe tomorrow I'll wake up and suddenly be able to shower really fast.",2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,"God, I'm starving. Must be from the loss of blood.",2
RORY,"Yes, that must be it.",2
LORELAI,I'm getting pancakes with a side of pancakes. Where's Luke?,2
RORY,I don't know. Storage room?,2
LORELAI,Oh no.,2
RORY,Caesar's cooking.,2
LORELAI,Why is Caesar cooking?,2
RORY,I don't know.,2
LORELAI,That's bad.,2
RORY,His pancakes stink.,2
LORELAI,They do stink.,2
RORY,"Well, what do we do? Resort to doughnuts.",2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,"Hey Luke, are you in there?",2
LUKE,Ow!,2
LORELAI,"Luke, are you okay?",2
LUKE,Stupid box! Stupid lamp!,2
LORELAI,"Hey Luke, are you being att*cked by your possessions again?",2
LORELAI,Hi.,2
LUKE,Hi.,2
LORELAI,Whatcha doing?,2
LUKE,I'm looking for my supply ledger.,2
LORELAI,Is it going well?,2
LUKE,It's going fine.,2
LORELAI,You have a sock on your shoulder. Is it helping you look?,2
LUKE,What are you doing up here?,2
LORELAI,Rory and I are starving. We need you to cook us breakfast. Oh my God.,2
LUKE,Caesar can make you breakfast.,2
LORELAI,What happened to this place?,2
LUKE,Nothing.,2
LORELAI,This is what I always pictured the inside of my head to look like.,2
LUKE,See if you can find a brown leather ledger.,2
LORELAI,I've never seen so much stuff. It looks like a white trash Hearst Castle in here.,2
LUKE,"On second thought, I'll find it myself.",2
LORELAI,Where'd all this come from?,2
LUKE,Jess. Liz shipped the rest of his stuff last week. He finally unpacked.,2
LORELAI,"Well, he did a very nice job.",2
LUKE,"I know it's crazy now, but I just have to get it all organized, figure out where to put everything, buy another dresser, a portable wardrobe, some storage bins.",2
LORELAI,"Can of gasoline, box of matches.",2
LUKE,Did I mention that Caesar can cook you breakfast?,2
LORELAI,But he doesn't make the good fluffy pancakes like you do.,2
LUKE,Then order eggs.,2
LORELAI,"No! See, I had a near death experience today.",2
LUKE,Really?,2
LORELAI,"Yes. I almost fell off the roof of my house trying to clean the rain gutters, so I have to have pancakes. Please? I'll help you shower when I become a superhero.",2
LUKE,You've been in there for two hours.,2
JESS,"Yeah, well my hair just ain't bouncin' and behavin' today.",2
LUKE,"There are other people living here too, you know.",2
JESS,"Huh, learn something new everyday.",2
LORELAI,"Well, his people skills are really improving.",2
LUKE,Go downstairs. I'll be there as soon as I can.,2
LORELAI,How long is that?,2
LUKE,I don't know.,2
LORELAI,An estimate.,2
LUKE,I don't know.,2
LORELAI,Ballpark figure.,2
LUKE,I - .,2
LORELAI,Off the top of your head.,2
LUKE,Will you  ,2
LORELAI,Did I mention that I almost fell off my roof today?,2
LUKE,I'd lie down if I could find the bed.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, is this what you're looking for?",2
LUKE,"Yes, great, thank you.",2
LORELAI,Not unless you make me the pancakes.,2
LUKE,Give me the book.,2
LORELAI,Give me the pancake!,2
LUKE,Come on.,2
LORELAI,Thank you.,2
LUKE,,2
LORELAI,"Well, I think I'm finally ready to get a tattoo.",2
RORY,Oh please.,2
LORELAI,I am.,2
RORY,You've been saying that for the last five years.,2
LORELAI,"I know, but I mean it this time.",2
RORY,"Fine, what are you getting?",2
LORELAI,Mel Brooks.,2
RORY,Why?,2
LORELAI,"What do you mean, why? The Two Thousand Year Old Man, Young Frankenstein, Silent Movie   you don't think Mel has earned the right to have his face on my butt?",2
RORY,"I am so sorry, Mel.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, he'll love it, trust me. So, rocky road hot fudge sundaes and two cans of whipped cream to go with the movies?",2
RORY,Trying to give Mel a bigger canvas to work with?,2
LORELAI,"Hey, the man's a legend, he deserves the best.",2
LORELAI,Hey.,2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,Luke.,2
RORY,What's he doing?,2
LORELAI,"I'm not sure. Hey, will you go get the ice cream and make sure they give us a ton of maraschino cherries?",2
RORY,Okay.,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,Hey,2
LUKE,"Hey, what are you doing?",2
LORELAI,"Oh, uh, Rory and I just hit the video store. Now we're on our way home to eat a large amount of something you would not approve of.",2
LUKE,Sounds good.,2
LORELAI,What are you doing?,2
LUKE,"Oh, watching TV.",2
LORELAI,"Ah. Wow, that's cute. Is this the first time it's been away from its mother?",2
LUKE,It's a very good TV.,2
LORELAI,"Hm, black and white, coat hanger antenna, really bad reception.",2
LUKE,It's fine.,2
LORELAI,Don't you have a fully grown TV upstairs?,2
LUKE,"Yeah, well, Jess is upstairs.",2
LORELAI,So?,2
LUKE,"So when Jess is upstairs, that means the stereo's blaring and the place is a mess. I just needed a little privacy.",2
LORELAI,So you came downstairs.,2
LUKE,Yes.,2
LORELAI,To sit on an uncomfortable chair in an empty diner that smells like onion rings.,2
LUKE,Yes.,2
LORELAI,"Calgon, take me aw ay.",2
LUKE,It was very peaceful until two minutes ago.,2
LORELAI,"Hey Luke, do you ever think that, uh, maybe you should get a bigger apartment?",2
LUKE,I don't need a bigger apartment.,2
LORELAI,That place upstairs was your father's office. You turned it into an apartment. It was never meant to be lived in.,2
LUKE,It's fine.,2
LORELAI,It's too small for two people. It's too small for one person if they have any kind of life.,2
LUKE,"We'll make due, we just need to organize.",2
LORELAI,"No, you don't need to organize. You need to move.",2
LUKE,I like my apartment.,2
LORELAI,It's not just your apartment. Jess lives there also.,2
LUKE,Jess is fine.,2
LORELAI,Are you sure? Because he could be pinned down under a box for a year in that place and you wouldn't know it until the neighbors started to complain about the smell.,2
RORY,Hey Luke.,2
LUKE,"Rory, perfect, get her out of here. Go.",2
LORELAI,"But, uh, okay, fine. I'm leaving. Think about what I said.",2
LUKE,"Oh, hey, did you ever hire anybody to do that work for you?",2
LORELAI,What?,2
LUKE,The rain gutters.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, no, not yet. Are you offering?",2
LUKE,"No, actually, I was thinking about Jess.",2
LORELAI,"Uh, Jess?",2
LUKE,"Yeah, he's always looking for a little extra cash. He doesn't make that much here, and, you know, I hate to think of where else he might try to get it, so ",2
LORELAI,Huh.,2
LUKE,"I mean, you don't have to pay him the same as would someone else, and you save a little, hekeeps busy.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, well, maybe. Um, I actually have to check with a couple of people I'm supposed to hear from, but if they can't do it, then sure.",2
LUKE,"Great, just let me know.",2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,So who are all these people you asked to clean out our gutters?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, well, you know.",2
RORY,I do?,2
LORELAI,Sh-yeah.,2
RORY,Remind me.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, well, there's Sid.",2
RORY,"Oh, Sid, right.",2
LORELAI,And then there's Lou.,2
RORY,"Yeah, a good man, Lou.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, and also Moose. That is, if Doris will let him out of the house again, you know, after that incident at Chicky's bachelor party.",2
RORY,I thought you said you were gonna give Jess a chance.,2
LORELAI,I am.,2
RORY,Then why don't you hire him?,2
LORELAI,"I'm just not very comfortable with him, Rory.",2
RORY,"Well, try and get comfortable.",2
LORELAI,"Well, I don't know if I can.",2
RORY,But you said - .,2
LORELAI,"I know what I said, but I can't help it.",2
RORY,How many times do I have to tell you   .,2
LORELAI,That I don't know the real Jess?,2
RORY,You don't.,2
LORELAI,"Well, fine, I don't know him, but I'm not too fond of his stand in.",2
RORY,"People are different once you get to know them. If you'll remember, you weren't too fond of Luke when you first met him.",2
LORELAI,That's not true.,2
RORY,You called him Duke for two years just to make him mad.,2
LORELAI,"And let me tell you, it worked.",2
RORY,"But then you guys talked and eventually, time went by, and now you love him.",2
LORELAI,Well. . .,2
RORY,I'm just asking you to give Jess that same chance.,2
LORELAI,"Rory, you like him. I don't have to like him.",2
RORY,Please?,2
LORELAI,Can I at least call him Tess for a little while?,2
RORY,You'll give him the job?,2
LORELAI,I'll give him the job.,2
RORY,Thank you.,2
LORELAI,You're welcome. Tell me something.,2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,Why is it so important to you that I like him?,2
RORY,"Well, I just think that he's Luke's nephew and we like Luke and we eat at Luke's everyday, and we see Jess when we eat there everyday, and that it just might make things nicer if you liked him.",2
LORELAI,And that's the only reason?,2
RORY,Yes.,2
LORELAI,It's all about Luke and the diner?,2
RORY,Yes.,2
LORELAI,It has nothing to do with you?,2
RORY,No.,2
LORELAI,So you and Jess aren't friends?,2
RORY,"Well, yeah, we're friends.",2
LORELAI,Uh huh.,2
RORY,"I mean, we're not good friends but we're friends. We're friendly. But that doesn't mean that we're friends in the traditional Webster's dictionary definition of friends.",2
LORELAI,Right.,2
RORY,Friendish might be a better term.,2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,,2
LUKE,"Jess? How can anyone sleep through that? It's like the Huns are attacking and you're just   well, you're oblivious and that's why you can just lie there while the rest of the world is going - . Great! Dammit! Dammit! Dammit! Dammit !",2
JESS,"Whoa, geez, what the hell?",2
LUKE,"I can't stand it, I'm going crazy. This place is awful. I can't live like this anymore.",2
JESS,Just relax.,2
LUKE,"I can't relax. I can't sleep. I'm having nightmares about being chased around by boxes with arms and they tackle me an d pile clothing on top of my face and secure it around my head with packing tape and I'm just lying there choking while you're sitting in the corner laughing, putting gel in your hair with a switchblade!",2
JESS,Should I be putting a tongue depressor in your mouth right about now?,2
LUKE,We're moving.,2
JESS,What?,2
LUKE,Tomorrow.,2
JESS,What are you talking about?,2
LUKE,"I'm talking about you and me going out, getting a paper, and finding a new place to live.",2
JESS,But I   .,2
LUKE,"No buts. Ten o'clock tomorrow morning I want you up, washed, moussed, and ready to leave, end of story. Now go back to bed. What?",2
JESS,,2
JESS,Forget it.,2
LUKE,"Why, what was wrong with that one?",2
JESS,It was pink.,2
LUKE,We can paint it.,2
JESS,You mean I can paint it.,2
LUKE,We can paint it together.,2
JESS,"Great, then we can hold hands and skip afterwards.",2
LUKE,"Fine, which one do you like?",2
JESS,The one before.,2
LUKE,The one with the two fridges?,2
JESS,No.,2
LUKE,"Well, the one before was the one with two fridges.",2
JESS,"No, the one we saw before was the one with the cat.",2
LUKE,I hate cats.,2
JESS,"Well, I don't think the cat came w ith the place.",2
LUKE,"Yeah, but it had carpeting which means it's always gonna smell like a cat.",2
JESS,Clean the carpet.,2
LUKE,Paint the pink.,2
JESS,"Fine, the one next to the bank.",2
LUKE,Too many windows.,2
JESS,What?,2
LUKE,"Six windows all on one side, three o'clock in the afternoon   we're sitting in an oven.",2
JESS,So we get curtains.,2
LUKE,"Well, you'll have to help me put them up.",2
JESS,"Great, then we can hold hands and skip afterwards.",2
LUKE,Stop saying that.,2
JESS,"You know what, I don't care. Pick whichever one you want.",2
LUKE,I'm not picking by myself.,2
JESS,You're the one who wants to move.,2
LUKE,"Oh, so you like living the way we do?",2
JESS,Fine by me.,2
LUKE,"No space, no privacy.",2
JESS,I got plenty of privacy.,2
LUKE,"Yeah, because I'm sitting downstairs in the dark watching a two-inch V.",2
JESS,"Hey, you're the one with the problem, you make the choice.",2
LUKE,"Jess, come on.",2
JESS,I have to go.,2
LUKE,We got three more places to look at.,2
JESS,"I'm supposed to be at Lorelai's in twenty minutes, remember?",2
LUKE,"Oh, yeah.",2
JESS,"I mean, if you want me to bail on her, fine.",2
LUKE,"Nah, you go. I'll look at the places all alone.",2
JESS,Great idea.,2
LUKE,I'll take some Polaroids and you can take a look at them later.,2
JESS,"Take a Polaroid, paint a still picture, whatever you want.",2
LUKE,"Jess, come on.",2
JESS,,2
RORY,Mom?,2
LORELAI,"Come here, come here, come here.",2
RORY,"I'm here, what's the matter?",2
LORELAI,"Sit, sit, sit. Okay, that should do it.",2
RORY,Do what?,2
LORELAI,Wait.,2
RORY,What are we waiting for?,2
LORELAI,"Patience, grasshopper.",2
RORY,Are we close?,2
LORELAI,"Very close. Hm, getting closer.",2
RORY,Should I get chips?,2
LORELAI,"Ready, and   .",2
RORY,The clock is grunting.,2
LORELAI,"This, my friend, is a state of the art CD/clock radio that enables you to wake up to the barnyard animal of your choice.",2
RORY,That is great.,2
LORELAI,I have selected the perky piggies. You might choose the cheery chickens or the goofy goats.,2
RORY,That is closest to a farm that I ever wanna get.,2
LORELAI,"Amen, sister friend.",2
RORY,I'll get it. Hey.,2
JESS,Here.,2
RORY,The Shaggs?,2
JESS,Trust me,2
RORY,Okay. So you're very punctual.,2
JESS,"Yeah, well, it was this or continue apartment hunting with Luke.",2
RORY,You're moving?,2
JESS,"I don't know. Luke flipped out last night and next thing I know, he's dragging me all over town banging on pipes and measuring square footage. It's crazy.",2
RORY,"A new place might be nice. More space, maybe you'll get your own room.",2
JESS,You change your hair?,2
RORY,What?,2
JESS,Your hair looks different.,2
RORY,"So, segue's not your thing, huh?",2
JESS,Is it?,2
RORY,"Well, um, no, I wear it like this a lot. Why?",2
JESS,Just looks different.,2
RORY,"Oh, bad different?",2
LORELAI,"Hey, ducks!",2
RORY,We just got a new alarm clock.,2
JESS,Huh. Bet I know what the lead story in the Stars Hollow Gazette's gonna be tomorrow.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, did you hear the ducks  cause they're great. Oh Jess, you're here, terrific.",2
RORY,"So, um, would you like to come in ?",2
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, come on in. Sorry, it's just. . .so excited about the ducks that, uh. . .do you want something to drink? You have good timing  cause we shopped yesterday, and in addition to a case of Maybelline Fresh Lash Mascara, I also bought some of that new, uh, freaky Coke with the lemon in it. It's very addictive.",2
RORY,"You can sit, you know.",2
JESS,No thanks.,2
LORELAI,"So, Jess, what's new?",2
JESS,Not much.,2
RORY,Jess and Luke are looking for an apartment.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, you guys see anything good yet?",2
JESS,Nope.,2
LORELAI,"Well, you know, there's some really cool places over on Peach. Or on Plum. Hm, Orange. Basically, any of your fruit named streets are pretty nice. Okay, well, I guess you should get started. Um, there's a ladder right out front and some buckets and gloves and stuff on the porch. You need anything else, just walk against the wind.",2
RORY,"Come on, I'll show you.",2
LORELAI,I'm trying.,2
RORY,,2
RORY,Question.,2
JESS,Yes?,2
RORY,"You come over. You seem to have a very firm grasp of the English language. You put together several full sentences, even using a couple of words that contain two or more syllables, and then my mother appears and suddenly we need a thought bubble over your head to understand what you're thinking. Can you tell me w hy that is?",2
JESS,The verbal thing comes and goes.,2
RORY,I would really appreciate it if you would try to get along with my mom.,2
JESS,I took the Coke.,2
RORY,I know.,2
JESS,"Personally, I think it's a little crazy to put lemon in Coke but I took it anyhow.",2
RORY,Stop it.,2
JESS,"Ooh, stern face.",2
RORY,"Look, I went out on a limb for you trying to get my mom to give you the benefit of the doubt, okay? So I don't think it would hurt you to try to be nice.",2
JESS,Why?,2
RORY,Why?,2
JESS,"Yeah, why?",2
RORY,Because she's my mom and she's a friend of Luke's.,2
JESS,So?,2
RORY,"What do you mean, so?",2
JESS,So just because she's your mom or Luke's friend doesn't mean that I automatically have to get along with her.,2
RORY,"Jess, my mother is a great person. She's also my best friend in the world, so if you care about me at all, you will take that into consideration and you will be mildly polite to her.",2
JESS,What makes you think I care about you?,2
RORY,"I don't mean care care, like care. I mean if you like me at all. . . not like like. I just meant that if. . . if you think of me remotely as the sort of person that you could occasionally stand to talk to then you will try to get along with my mom, that's all.",2
JESS,Okay.,2
RORY,Okay?,2
JESS,"I can't guarantee that it'll work, but I'll try.",2
RORY,Thank you.,2
JESS,You're welcome. I should probably get to work.,2
RORY,,2
RORY,"Inherit the Wind, seventy-five cents.",2
DEAN,Great.,2
RORY,"Now, here's a copy of Rilke's Letters to a Young Poet   which I already have, but in hardback. This is a paperback   fits perfectly in a coat pocket and it's only a dollar. I'm torn. Opinions?",2
DEAN,Get it.,2
RORY,You look bored.,2
DEAN,I'm fine.,2
RORY,You sure you don't wanna look around? They have great stuff here.,2
DEAN,I looked.,2
RORY,For five minutes.,2
DEAN,"No, I looked for twenty minutes and then I stopped and you continued for another two hours.",2
RORY,"It has not been that long. Oh, sorry.",2
DEAN,No big deal.,2
RORY,Let's go.,2
DEAN,Are you done?,2
RORY,"Yup, I've looked enough.",2
DEAN,You're not done.,2
RORY,"No, I'm fine, really. Let's go.",2
DEAN,"Rory, stop it. You wanna keep looking, I know you.",2
RORY,"No, I wanna hang out with you.",2
DEAN,Are you sure?,2
RORY,"Yes, I'll just pay for these and then we can go.",2
DEAN,I thought maybe we can go see The Lord of the Rings again.,2
RORY,"Oh, okay.",2
DEAN,What?,2
RORY,Nothing.,2
DEAN,"Well, I thought you loved The Lord of the Rings.",2
RORY,I do.,2
DEAN,You said you wanted to see it a hundred times.,2
RORY,"Yes, and apparently we're being very literal these days.",2
DEAN,"Fine, we'll see something else.",2
RORY,Lord of the Rings is fine. Can you help me with these?,2
KIRK,I'll give you fifty-five cents.,2
GYPSY,It's sixty-five.,2
KIRK,Fifty-five cents.,2
GYPSY,"Kirk, it's for charity. There's no haggling.",2
KIRK,"Oh no, there's always haggling. Sixty cents.",2
GYPSY,No.,2
KIRK,That's my final offer.,2
GYPSY,"I'm sorry, I can't.",2
KIRK,Fine.,2
GYPSY,"Kirk, come on.",2
KIRK,No.,2
GYPSY,Cough up another nickel.,2
KIRK,Forget it   it's the principal of the thing.,2
GYPSY,"Wow, you made out like a bandit.",2
RORY,"Well, you've got great stuff this year.",2
GYPSY,"Hey, did you see the astronomy section over there?",2
RORY,"Oh, yeah.",2
GYPSY,Didn't find anything?,2
RORY,Nope.,2
DEAN,"Wait, I didn't see you look over there.",2
RORY,"Well, I did.",2
DEAN,Go look.,2
RORY,I told you I'm done.,2
DEAN,"Hey, where. . . where's your bracelet?",2
RORY,What?,2
DEAN,You're not wearing your bracelet.,2
RORY,Oh.,2
DEAN,Where is it?,2
RORY,I took it off.,2
DEAN,Why?,2
RORY,"Well, because I got this weird rash on my wrist.",2
DEAN,From the bracelet?,2
RORY,"Oh no, just a fluke thing. Actually, I think my Spanish midterm gave it to me.",2
DEAN,Oh.,2
RORY,But it's getting better   it's almost gone.,2
DEAN,"Well, good.",2
RORY,"And as soon as it's completely gone, that bracelet goes right back on.",2
DEAN,"So, uh, compromise.",2
RORY,What?,2
DEAN,"You go look at the astronomy section, we'll go see Lord of the Rings, and on the way home we'll rent Autumn in New York and mock it for the rest of the afternoon.",2
RORY,With full-on impressions?,2
DEAN,With full-on impressions.,2
RORY,Deal.,2
DEAN,"Go, I'll wait here. Smiling, not at all bored.",2
KIRK,Sixty-two cents.,2
GYPSY,Get out of here Kirk.,2
KIRK,,2
LORELAI,"Jess? Hey, Jess!",2
JESS,"Sorry, too loud?",2
LORELAI,"Oh, no, it's fine. Uh, it's just. . . I got a ton of leftover Chinese food in the kitchen. I thought you might like some lunch.",2
JESS,No thanks.,2
LORELAI,Okay.,2
JESS,Chinese sounds great.,2
LORELAI,Really?,2
JESS,If you're sure you have enough.,2
LORELAI,There's plenty. Rory and I decided to take on the entire chicken column last night.,2
JESS,Ambitious.,2
LORELAI,"Well, it's all out on the table, so come in when you're ready.",2
JESS,I'm ready now.,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,"So, um, basically everything here is chicken. You've got garlic chicken, Kung Pao chicken, Szechuan Chicken, chicken in brown sauce, which looks and tastes remarkably like the Szechuan Chicken except it's got these red peppers in it and if you eat them, you die. Plate?",2
JESS,"I thought I'd, uh. . .",2
LORELAI,"Oh, soap's on the counter.",2
JESS,So when was the last time you had those gutters cleaned?,2
LORELAI,It's been awhile.,2
JESS,"Yeah, I found an  I like Ike' bumper sticker up there.",2
LORELAI,Is it really bad?,2
JESS,"Well, it won't be by tomorrow.",2
LORELAI,I like hearing that.,2
JESS,"So you guys aren't too hot on vegetables, huh?",2
LORELAI,What are you talking about? There's green pepper in the Kung Pao.,2
JESS,My mistake.,2
LORELAI,"So, are you a healthy eater like Luke?",2
JESS,No. No one's a healthy eater like Luke. Yule Gibbons wasn't a healthy eater like Luke.,2
LORELAI,"Wow, it's been ages since I've heard a good Yule Gibbons reference.",2
JESS,Many parts of a pine tree are edible.,2
LORELAI,"That's right. God, I wonder what the research process was like to get that information.",2
JESS,I'd say fairly painful.,2
LORELAI,Huh. Here. So how's school?,2
JESS,It's still there.,2
LORELAI,You on any teams or anything?,2
JESS,"No, no, no.",2
LORELAI,Not a jersey guy?,2
JESS,"No, definitely not a jersey guy. Though the thought of throwing a ball at some jock's head isn't entirely unappealing. Look, I'm not really good at this small talk thing.",2
LORELAI,You're doing okay. Cold egg roll?,2
JESS,Why not?,2
LORELAI,Bad?,2
JESS,Oh yeah.,2
RORY,Mom!,2
LORELAI,Here   right here! What?,2
RORY,Mom!,2
LORELAI,What's going on?,2
RORY,I don't know where it is!,2
LORELAI,Where what is?,2
RORY,My bracelet   it's gone.,2
LORELAI,What are you talking about?,2
RORY,How could I do this? How could I lose that bracelet?,2
LORELAI,"Honey, tell me w hich bracelet   maybe I stole it from you.",2
RORY,Dean's bracelet.,2
LORELAI,The one he made you?,2
RORY,Yes.,2
LORELAI,It's gone?,2
RORY,Yes.,2
LORELAI,Where?,2
RORY,I don't know where. If I knew where then I would have it.,2
LORELAI,"Well, when did you first notice it was gone?",2
RORY,When he pointed out that I wasn't wearing it.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, not good. What did you say?",2
RORY,That I had a rash and that I had to take it off until it healed.,2
LORELAI,"Nice save, Gretzky.",2
RORY,"It's not here, it's not here. God.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, let's retrace your steps. When was the last time you remember wearing it?",2
RORY,"Um, I don't know.",2
LORELAI,Think hard   yesterday?,2
RORY,I don't know.,2
LORELAI,The day before?,2
RORY,I don't know.,2
LORELAI,The day before that?,2
RORY,"Um, yeah.",2
LORELAI,Really?,2
RORY,"No, I don't rememb er. I can't remember. Help me move the couch.",2
LORELAI,What about your locker at school?,2
RORY,"I don't know why it would be there, I never take it off at school. I never take it off at all.",2
LORELAI,Anything?,2
RORY,Just Grandma's pen.,2
LORELAI,Leave it there.,2
RORY,Why?,2
LORELAI,It makes life fun,2
RORY,I'm gonna freak out now.,2
LORELAI,We'll find it.,2
RORY,I'm gonna have to tell Dean that I lost his bracelet.,2
LORELAI,Let's not even go there yet.,2
RORY,He made it for me.,2
LORELAI,He'll make you another one.,2
RORY,But he's gonna be mad.,2
LORELAI,He'll understand.,2
RORY,How do you know?,2
LORELAI,I'm looking at the track record and all signs point to he'll understand. Did you look in your room?,2
RORY,No.,2
LORELAI,"All right, I'll check the car. And don't worry   if worse comes to worse and we can't find it, we'll follow Dean to work, hide behind the cantaloupes, jump him, blind him and he'll never find out.",2
RORY,,2
MICHELorelai,Who is Randy Mill?,2
LORELAI,"Ugh, let me see. Maintenance.",2
MICHELorelai,Are you going to be down there long?,2
LORELAI,"Uh, I just wanna to make sure Rory's bracelet didn't get kicked back behind something.",2
MICHELorelai,"Hmm, and so earlier when you told me to look for the bracelet and I told you I did look and I did not find it, you ",2
LORELAI,Just decided to double check.,2
MICHELorelai,"Yes, though another theory is that you did not believe me.",2
LORELAI,I did too.,2
MICHELorelai,"No, I believe you thought I was lying. That I did not actually get down on my hands and knees in a brand new Donna Karan suit and crawl around on a floor where people who have stepped in mud and garbage and animal waste have been traipsing all day long.",2
LORELAI,It's not there.,2
MICHELorelai,"No? Why, I'm shocked.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, I'm sorry I doubted you, Michel.",2
MICHELorelai,"Well, that means a lot, thank you.",2
LORELAI,We turned the house upside down. Rory's having a heart attack. It's just awful.,2
MICHELorelai,"Yes, well, as soon as my dry cleaning bill is paid for, you will have my sympathies.",2
LORELAI,"I will pay for your suit, Michel.",2
MICHELorelai,Mm hmm.,2
MICHELorelai,"Independence Inn, Michel speaking. Hold on please. It's for you.",2
LORELAI,Lorelai here.,2
LUKE,I don't want a wood-burning fireplace.,2
LORELAI,Luke?,2
LUKE,"But if I take an apartment with a wood-burning fireplace, even though I could give a rat's ass about a wood-burning fireplace, I have to pay an extra two hundred dollars a month for the wood- burning fireplace.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, but - .",2
LUKE,And three of the places make you put down a five hundred dollar deposit if you have a dog. Can you believe this?,2
LORELAI,You don't have a dog.,2
LUKE,"I know, but it's wrong.",2
LORELAI,Agreed. What else?,2
LUKE,Parking.,2
LORELAI,Ah.,2
LUKE,"How can people ask you for a monthly fee for a parking space? I mean, they're making money off your rent, off your utilities, when you use their coin-operated washer and dryer   that's cash directly in their pocket. And by the way, it's not even that good a parking space. It's out in the open under one of those trees that drops the sap on your car that eats away your paint.",2
LORELAI,Luke?,2
LUKE,"Who's gonna pay for my car, huh? Where's my five hundred dollar, paint-k*lling tree sap deposit?",2
LORELAI,You haven't found a place yet?,2
LUKE,And I've been looking all day.,2
LORELAI,There wasn't one place you liked?,2
LUKE,No.,2
LORELAI,"Not one place that gave you a little feeling of,  Huh, well that has a nice vibe about it.'",2
LUKE,I don't use the word vibe.,2
LORELAI,Luke.,2
LUKE,Maybe one place wasn't so bad.,2
LORELAI,"Oh good, describe it to me.",2
LUKE,I don't know. It had walls with a kind of a floor with a light.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, hold on here, mister. If you tell me it's got a roof, I'm stealing that baby out from under you.",2
LUKE,I just can't tell anymore. I need a second opinion.,2
LORELAI,Do you want me to come look at your apartment?,2
LUKE,"It's not my apartment, and yes.",2
LORELAI,Done.,2
LUKE,Now.,2
LORELAI,What?,2
LUKE,Please?,2
LORELAI,"Uh, well -.",2
LUKE,I promised the woman I'd give her an answer today.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, give me the address.",2
LUKE,"Sixty-two and a half B Street. And that's another thing   what's with this half business? Why do all these apartments have this half thing going? It's stupid. If sixty-two is taken, move on to sixty-three.",2
LORELAI,"Luke, I'll meet you there in twenty and a half minutes.",2
LUKE,Thank you.,2
LORELAI,"Bye. Michel, I have to go out for a little while. Cover the desk for me.",2
MICHELorelai,Mm hmm.,2
LORELAI,What?,2
MICHELorelai,"Well, I mean, I'll say I'll cover the desk, but how will you know if I'm actually doing it?",2
LORELAI,"I trust you, Michel.",2
MICHELorelai,"I mean, it's just as possible I say I'll cover the desk, and the moment you've stepped away I'll put some fruit on my head and join a conga line somewhere.",2
LORELAI,I believe you looked for the bracelet.,2
MICHELorelai,"And while I'm shaking it to the Miami Sound Machine, the phones here   they would ring and ring and ring, and no one to answer, no one to assist.",2
LORELAI,,2
MARY,"It's a very quiet street and the owner keeps the building up beautifully. He hasn't remodeled it at all. Plus, I bet he could be persuaded to give the floor a little spruce if you like.",2
LORELAI,"Oh yeah, we'd like a spruce.",2
LUKE,A spruce is unnecessary.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, you never turn down a spruce.",2
MARY,She's right   listen to her.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, listen to me.",2
LUKE,You rarely give me a c hoice.,2
LORELAI,Come here so I can lick your face.,2
LUKE,What?,2
MARY,"Now, I went over the square footage and the details of the lease with your husband this morning. Did he fill you in?",2
LUKE,"What? Oh no, we're   .",2
LORELAI,"No, no, he didn't, but you know how men are. The minute that ball game comes on, all the realities of life just go right out the window.",2
MARY,Don't I know it.,2
LORELAI,"I mean, I could answer the door wrapped in cellophane but unless I was wearing a Yankees cap. . .ugh, he wouldn't even notice.",2
LUKE,Geez.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, don't be embarrassed Snuffy, I'm just teasing. It'd be a Mets cap.",2
LUKE,"Hey Mary, could you possibly leave me and little missus alone for just a minute?",2
MARY,"Why, of course.",2
LORELAI,I promise we won't do anything dirty.,2
MARY,"Oh please, if my husband and I looked anything like the two of you, we'd never get dressed.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, you are bad!",2
MARY,Let me just leave this rental agreement with you in case you decide to fill it out.,2
LUKE,Thanks.,2
MARY,"Oh, I hope you take it. It's got a great vibe for a nice couple like you two.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, thirteen different shades of red!",2
LUKE,What is wrong with you?,2
LORELAI,You make it too easy.,2
LUKE,By standing here?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, relax Snuffy. Let's talk. What do you think?",2
LUKE,She used the word vibe.,2
LORELAI,About the apartment.,2
LUKE,I don't know.,2
LORELAI,"Okay then, break it down. List your concerns.",2
LUKE,"Well, it's too big.",2
LORELAI,It's not too big. Next.,2
LUKE,I don't need two bathrooms.,2
LORELAI,"Yes, you do. Next.",2
LUKE,I like being on the bottom floor.,2
LORELAI,The top floor's quieter. Next.,2
LUKE,"You know, somehow I think this would be easier if you just listed your concerns first.",2
LORELAI,Okay. Um. . .I don't have any. I think it's great.,2
LUKE,You do?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, it's light and airy. It's got good windows but not too many so that the sun bakes you in the afternoon.",2
LUKE,Thank you.,2
LORELAI,"You're close to work, the price seems good, you're taking the spruce, and it's a two-year lease. What's two years?",2
LUKE,I don't know. I - .,2
LORELAI,"Luke, you need to do this. You and Jess will k*ll each other if you stay in that place of yours.",2
LUKE,"Yeah, but who knows how long he's gonna be here.",2
LORELAI,Why? Did something happen?,2
LUKE,"No, but you never know.",2
LORELAI,"No, you don't, but I think his mom sending his stuff is a pretty good sign.",2
LUKE,"And even if he does stay, it'll be only for another year, and then he'll go off to college or Attica or whatever, and it'll just be me again.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, but - .",2
LUKE,"And stuck with a new apartment, probably with neighbors I hate who are constantly cooking really strong smelling food.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, back up here. Yes, Jess may go off somewhere someday, but that doesn't mean you will be alone forever.",2
LUKE,I am not getting a pet.,2
LORELAI,I'm talking about a lady friend.,2
LUKE,Oh.,2
LORELAI,A red-hot mama.,2
LUKE,Okay.,2
LORELAI,"A big, pretty dish of lovin' with a spoon made especially for you.",2
LUKE,"Boy, do I not feel good now.",2
LORELAI,"Luke, Rachel's not the only woman in the world for you. You'll meet someone, someday -- probably at a Timberland store, you'll ask her out. You'll pick her up and take her on a patentedLuke Danes night of romance -- juice bar followed by the batting cages -- and then you'll ask her back to your apartment.",2
LUKE,Any amount of money if you stop right now.,2
LORELAI,"You'll bring her back to your place, lead her upstairs to the apartment door. You pause, gaze into her eyes   the stage is set, fate is waiting. You open the door, and she sees your teeny, tiny apartment   one room and no closet space and Jess' feet sticking up in the air  cause you never did get rid of that body!",2
LUKE,"Stop, please.",2
LORELAI,"And to make matters worse, she spots",2
it,the single bed.,2
LUKE,What's wrong with a single bed?,2
LORELAI,You know what they say.,2
LUKE,"No, what do they say?",2
LORELAI,"Never, ever date a guy who owns a single bed. It means he's not open to a commitment.",2
LUKE,What?,2
LORELAI,It says there's no room in this life for anybody but me.,2
LUKE,"No, it says there's no room in this bed for anyone but me.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, see, that's not a whole lot better.",2
LUKE,This discussion is now over.,2
LORELAI,"Luke, as long as you're in that apartment, you're gonna have a single bed. Don't you want the possibility of more? Come on Luke, it's time. Make a move, take a shot, entertain the possibility of a non-unabomber existence. What do you say?",2
LUKE,You got a pen? I'm not taking the spruce.,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,Hey.,2
JESS,Hey.,2
LORELAI,Did you get lost?,2
JESS,"No, I was looking at Rory's books.",2
LORELAI,Uh huh.,2
JESS,I wanted to see if she had Franny and Zooey. She does.,2
LORELAI,Okay.,2
JESS,I was gonna get it for her if she didn't.,2
LORELAI,That's very nice of you.,2
JESS,"Yeah. Okay, so I should probably get back to work.",2
LORELAI,,2
TAYLORory,"Luke, good good goody good good. I was just on my way over to the diner to talk to you.",2
LUKE,"Great. Go on over, I'll meet you there.",2
TAYLORory,"Oh, stop it, this isn't about anything that's gonna make you mad. I just have a couple of questions about your application.",2
LUKE,What?,2
TAYLORory,Your application. Now I called your bank - .,2
LUKE,What application?,2
TAYLORory,Your application for the apartment. Now you have two accounts here -.,2
LUKE,How did you get my application?,2
TAYLORory,"Well, Mary gave it to me, of course. Now I'm assuming that one of those accounts -.",2
LUKE,Why would Mary give you my application?,2
TAYLORory,Because I own the building.,2
LUKE,What? When the hell did you buy an apartment building?,2
TAYLORory,"Well, I bought this particular one about two months ago.",2
LUKE,"I look at a thousand apartments, I choose yours. How is that possible?",2
TAYLORory,"Well, count yourself lucky, you. With me as the owner, there is a level of quality control that is sorely lacking in this town. For example, at all my properties, we measure the grass before, during, and after mowing to attain a perfect inch and a half height, which is both pleasing to the eye and good for the grass.",2
LUKE,All of your properties?,2
TAYLORory,Ten in all.,2
LUKE,"Ten properties? What are you, buying up the town?",2
TAYLORory,"Not yet, but someday   who knows?",2
LUKE,But why isn't anyone stopping you?,2
TAYLORory,"Because, my friend, people are lazy. They don't wanna think about the proper fabric for an awning or the correct historical color for a building. They just slap any old thing up on a wall and sleep like babies. But soon, hopefully, the city council will put an end to that.",2
LUKE,"Taylor, you cannot tell people what color to paint their buildings!",2
TAYLORory,"Well, someone has to.",2
LUKE,"No, they don't. We don't live in a fascist country.",2
TAYLORory,"Oh, this isn't about the fascists   who, by the way, had their faults but their parks were spotless.",2
LUKE,I have to get out of here.,2
TAYLORory,,2
TAYLORory,"Luke, hold it! I still need to talk to you.",2
LUKE,"Just tear up the application, Taylor. I'm not moving.",2
TAYLORory,What? Why?,2
LUKE, Cause I'm the two-inch grass kind of guy.,2
TAYLORory,"Well, that's too bad but I need to talk to you about something else.",2
LUKE,What?,2
TAYLORory,"I'm thinking about purchasing the flower shop next to the diner, but we need to talk about that sign of yours.",2
LUKE,What about my sign?,2
TAYLORory,"Well, you have a diner but you never took down the Williams' Hardware sign.",2
LUKE,That was my father's sign.,2
TAYLORory,"I understand that you have a sentimental attachment to the sign, but it confuses the tourists.",2
LUKE,"Back off the sign, Taylor.",2
TAYLORory,"If I buy the building next to that sign, I run the risk of people being so busy trying to figure out if you sell hammer s or burgers, that they never notice the nice collectible plate store right next door.",2
LUKE,Collectible plates?,2
TAYLORory,"Isn't that a great idea? Elvis, The Beatles, Mary Poppins, all the greats. You can hang themon the wall or you buy a little stand and set them up on the coffee table.",2
LUKE,"Okay, you need to get away from me now. At least a good arm swinging length away.",2
TAYLORory,"It's people like you who keep this town from becoming one of great towns in America, Luke.",2
LUKE,Arm swinging length!,2
TAYLORory,,2
JESS,You look good.,2
RORY,I'm fine.,2
JESS,Talk.,2
RORY,I lost my bracelet.,2
JESS,Uh huh.,2
RORY,Dean gave it to me.,2
JESS,How thoughtful.,2
RORY,"I've been all over town looking for it. I've been to Lane's, I've been to Luke's, I've been to the bus stop, I've been to Miss Patty's, and I've circled Stars Hollow twice and nothing. I have no idea what I'm going to do.",2
JESS,It's really that big a deal?,2
RORY,What do you mean?,2
JESS,"I mean, I know it's got an  I've been pinned' Bye, Bye, Birdie kind of implication to it, but it was just a bracelet.",2
RORY,I don't think Dean will see it that way.,2
JESS,You didn't lose it on purpose.,2
RORY,"I know, but things have been a little weird between us lately and. . .you couldn't care less.",2
JESS,"Oh, yes, I could.",2
RORY,I just think Dean will read something into this.,2
JESS,Should he?,2
RORY,No.,2
JESS,I think you should keep looking.,2
RORY,Where?,2
JESS,Anywhere. Things you lose are usually right in front of your face. Check the house again.,2
RORY,I've checked the house.,2
JESS,It's probably just laying in your room somewhere.,2
RORY,"No, I tore that room apart, it's not there.",2
JESS,"Fine, give up then. No biggie. Dean'll just have to get over it.",2
RORY,I'll go look again.,2
JESS,,2
LORELAI,"Hey, where have you been?",2
RORY,Scouring the town.,2
LORELAI,"Nothing, huh?",2
RORY,Not yet. I'm gonna check my room again.,2
LORELAI,Haven't you already looked in there like a thousand times.,2
RORY,"A thousand and one. Mom, come here, hurry!",2
LORELAI,Rory?,2
RORY,Mom!,2
LORELAI,Are you okay?,2
RORY,I found it!,2
LORELAI,What?,2
RORY,"I looked under the bed and there it was. I thought I had already looked under the bed, but I don't know, maybe I was too panicked or. . .I don't know, who cares, I got it!",2
LORELAI,"Aw, that is amazing!",2
RORY,Put it on.,2
LORELAI,Hmm.,2
RORY,Make it tight.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, I'm cutting off circulation here, baby.",2
RORY,"Oh, look at it. It looks even better than before, doesn't it?",2
LORELAI,I think the time aw ay from home did it some good.,2
RORY,"Okay, when I get back, we celebrate.",2
LORELAI,Where are you going?,2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,You leaving?,2
JESS,"Yeah, all done.",2
LORELAI,You weren't gonna come get your money?,2
JESS,"Ah, I figured I'd get it eventually. It's not like I don't know where you guys live.",2
LORELAI,"That's true. You certainly do know where we live. Well here. After all, you earned it.",2
JESS,Thanks.,2
LORELAI,"You took it, didn't you?",2
JESS,Excuse me.,2
LORELAI,Rory's bracelet   you had it the whole time.,2
JESS,No idea what you're talking about.,2
LORELAI,How'd you get it?,2
JESS,I didn't get anything.,2
LORELAI,"What, did you break into our house, you got all dressed in black and pulled a",2
Mission,Impossible?,2
JESS,"Actually, I came down the chimney and pulled a Santa Claus.",2
LORELAI,Very funny.,2
JESS,Thought a ridiculous accusation deserved a ridiculous response.,2
LORELAI,So it's just a great big ol' coincidence that I catch you coming out of Rory's room a half an hour before she mysteriously finds the bracelet under her bed?,2
JESS,Guess so.,2
LORELAI,Why would you do this?,2
JESS,I gotta go.,2
LORELAI,"I mean, I know you hate the world, but I thought you liked Rory.",2
JESS,I didn't do anything.,2
LORELAI,Bull.,2
JESS,Whatever.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, don't whatever me, you little jerk. You let Rory run around completely panicked, thinking she lost her boyfriend's bracelet. She was miserable, do you understand that?",2
JESS,I didn't take it.,2
LORELAI,"I'm sure you're jealous of Dean because he's great and Rory's madly in love with him, but you taking the bracelet didn't hurt Dean, it hurt Rory. That bracelet is the most precious thing she owns. She never takes it off. It means everything to her. And you stealing it was unbelievably cruel.",2
JESS,The most precious thing she owns?,2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
JESS,"If it's the most precious thing she owns, why did it take her two weeks to figure out it was gone, huh? You might wanna reevaluate how madly in love she is. I wouldn't start calling him son yet.",2
LORELAI,Get outta here.,2
JESS,,2
LUKE,I just spent a hundred thousand dollars and it's all your fault!,2
LORELAI,"Oh, good.",2
LUKE,"I ran into Taylor at the market, and I found out he owns the building that apartment was in.",2
LORELAI,No way.,2
LUKE,That and several others all over town.,2
LORELAI,That is so weird.,2
LUKE,He's systematically buying up the town. He's gonna turn it into Taylorville where everyone'll wear cardigans and have the same grass height.,2
LORELAI,"Luke, do you wanna sit down?",2
LUKE,"And then he told me he's gonna buy the building next to the diner, turn it into a plate shop for freaks who don't have enough brain power to collect stamps. I lost it.",2
LORELAI,"Uh, I can't picture that.",2
LUKE,I walked around in a blind rage. I was crazy. I bought one of those Belgian waffles with the ice cream dipped in chocolate.,2
LORELAI,You ate that?,2
LUKE,"No, I didn't eat it!",2
LORELAI,Of course not.,2
LUKE,"I'm upset, not suicidal.",2
LORELAI,Right.,2
LUKE,"I knew I just had to do something, and I had your voice going round and round in my head.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, it's kinda like the Small World song.",2
LUKE,"Take a chance, Luke. Make a move, Luke. Can't have a single bed, Luke. So I bought the building!",2
LORELAI,You   you what?,2
LUKE,"I went to the bank and got a cashier's check, signed the papers and I bought the building.",2
LORELAI,Wow,2
LUKE,I am the building's owner.,2
LORELAI,I heard.,2
LUKE,I own the building.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, well, don't worry, maybe you can still get out of it. You can go back and tell them you lost your mind.",2
LUKE,Okay.,2
LORELAI,Or I bet you can sell it to Taylor.,2
LUKE,Yeah.,2
LORELAI,"So, relax, you can still get out of this.",2
LUKE,Okay.,2
LORELAI,Unless you don't wanna get out of it.,2
LUKE,"Oh no, I wanna get out of this. Uh, why would I not wanna get out of this?",2
LORELAI,"Oh, well, owning that building gives you some options.",2
LUKE,Like?,2
LORELAI,"Uh, like you could expand Luke's if you wanted to.",2
LUKE,Yah.,2
LORELAI,Or you could rent it to someone else.,2
LUKE,Yah.,2
LORELAI,Someone else who might drive Taylor crazy.,2
LUKE,Maybe I should think about this.,2
LORELAI,"Sure, sleep on it.",2
LUKE,"Sleep on it, right, right.",2
LORELAI,You want some tea?,2
LUKE,"Tea's good, sure.",2
LORELAI,"Hey Luke, um, does Jess ever talk to you about Rory?",2
LUKE,"Uh, what do you mean?",2
LORELAI,I don't know. They just. . .they seem to be thrown together quite a lot lately and I was just trying to figure out if that's a coincidence or - .,2
LUKE,Or if there's something going on.,2
LORELAI,Yeah.,2
LUKE,I don't know.,2
LORELAI,Huh.,2
LUKE,Jess doesn't exactly confide in me.,2
LORELAI,Right.,2
LUKE,"Of course, if there was something going on, I think that'd be really great.",2
LORELAI,You do?,2
LUKE,"Yeah. Rory's a great kid, she'd be really good for Jess.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, she would.",2
LUKE,You really think there might be something going on?,2
LORELAI,I don't know,2
LUKE,"Boy, that would be great.",2

TOM,We're redoing your apartment. What do you think is going on up there?,2
LUKE,The ceiling's falling in. I've got customers eating drywall here.,2
TOM,"Oh, well, that can't be good.",2
LUKE,You said minimal disruptions.,2
TOM,"Hey, this is minimal disruptions. Look, I need you to sign this change order.",2
LUKE,What happened now?,2
TOM,"Well, we broke through this wall and we found some pipes that shouldn't be there. We gotta move them.",2
LUKE,Move them where?,2
TOM,Not sure. We gotta find out what they do first.,2
LUKE,You're kidding?,2
TOM,Oh yeah. There's nothing I like more than a good  moving a pipe' joke.,2

EMILY,I wanted to know if you'd like a gift certificate for a weekend at the Birch Grove Spa.,2
LORELAI,Are you serious?,2
EMILY,I bid on it at the DAR Symphony Fundraiser and I won.,2
LORELAI,"Birch Grove? That's supposed to be an amazing place, why don't you go?",2
EMILY,"Oh, I've never had any real desire to go to a spa.",2
LORELAI,Why'd you bid on it then?,2
EMILY,"It was for charity, I had to bid on something. And I certainly didn't want another portrait of George Washington. I've got four in the attic already.",2
LORELAI,"Well, I'd love it.",2
EMILY,Good.,2
LORELAI,"Two days of total mind-numbing pampering. Massages, facials, aromatherapy.",2
EMILY,"My goodness, you make it sound like heaven.",2
LORELAI,It's as close as you'll ever come to being a dog.,2
EMILY,I beg your pardon?,2

RORY,"Oh, my mistake.",2
LORELAI,"So here's the deal   I go into my facial just as my mother is finishing her salt glow, which will end ten minutes after I've hit my scalp treatment which puts me in the watsu massage pool at least six minutes into her back facial.

LORELAI,When do the bikers and lowlifes get to trash the place?,2
RORY,You're all packed.,2
LORELAI,"Rory, you have to do something bad when Mommy's out of town. It's the law. You're seen Risky Business, right? Now I'm not asking for a prostitution ring, but how about a floating craps game or something?",2
RORY,I'll see what I can do.,2
LORELAI,I would greatly appreciate it.,2
RORY,I think Grandma's here.,2

RORY,So?,2
PARIS,"What do you mean, so? I got an A-minus. I have never gotten an A-minus. I just can't focus lately. Things are so weird at my house. My dad finally figured out exactly how much it was gonna cost him to divorce my mom, so now he's back and it's bad enough that I wasted all that time crunching the numbers with him, but now that he's back, they're fighting and redecorating. The place is a mess. I need help.",2

EMILY,I even had them mo ve the pedicure tubs together in the same room so we can talk during it.,2

DEAN,You don't want me to come over?,2
RORY,"No, I just. . .I almost never get the house all to myself and I thought with my mom gone, I can finally do my laundry exactly the way I like it.

RORY,And watch TV and eat the Indian food that I love but my mom hates the smell of and go to bed early and. . .are you mad?,2
DEAN,Why would I be mad? You wanna spend tonight alone.,2
RORY,"But hey, tomorrow, the whole day is all about you. I mean it, from morning  til night. You plan it, or I'll plan it, or we can get a professional to plan it, whatever you want. Just don't be mad.",2
DEAN,I'm not. I'm not mad.,2
RORY,Good.,2
DEAN,"I'm confused, but I'm not mad.",2
RORY,Fine,2
DEAN,"I'm a saint, but I'm not mad.",2
RORY,Thank you.,2
DEAN,You're welcome.,2
RORY,,2
EMILY,How do I look?,2
LORELAI,Like a landlady. What is this?,2
EMILY,I got adjoining rooms so we don't have to go out in the hallway to get to each other.,2
LORELAI,Great thinking!,2
EMILY,"God, this robe is fabulous. How do they get it so soft?",2
LORELAI,"Well, I think having about forty other people wear it first is part of the secret.",2
EMILY,"Oh, stop it. So are you all ready for our skin rejuvenating and revitalizing collagen facial and eye treatment?",2
LORELAI,Almost.,2
EMILY,"It has vitamin C and plant extracts in it, which is the hottest thing in skin care these days. And the eye treatment is supposed to reduce puffiness and minimize the appearance of fine lines.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, no more brochures for you. All right, I'm ready, let's go.",2
EMILY,Aren't you gonna wear your robe?,2
LORELAI,What?,2
EMILY,"Your robe, you're supposed to wear your robe.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, well, I'm sure they'll give me one when I get there.",2
EMILY,But these robes are wonderful.,2
LORELAI,Mom.,2
EMILY,They help you relax.,2
LORELAI,"We're late, Mom.",2
EMILY,"They're wonderful, relaxing robes.",2
LORELAI,Oh my God.,2
EMILY,"And yet, you stand there like it's some badge of honor not to put on your robe like everyone else in this place. This isn't for me, you know, it's for you. I already have on my robe. I'm already relaxed. What are you doing?",2
LORELAI,"You're kidding me, right?",2
EMILY,"Well, hurry up, we're gonna be late.",2
LORELAI,Happy?,2
EMILY,,2
FACIALIST,"So, how are we doing?",2
LORELAI,So good.,2
FACIALIST,"Okay. Well, I'm gonna leave you to sit for a few minutes, so just relax and enjoy, and I'll be right back.",2
LORELAI,Thanks.,2
EMILY,Are your feet sweating?,2
LORELAI,Mom?,2
EMILY,Those booties make my feet sweat. Don't they make your feet sweat?,2
LORELAI,What are you doing in my room?,2
EMILY,Magda left me sitting for twenty minutes. Fine time to take a coffee break.,2
LORELAI,She's not taking a coffee break. Your skin is supposed to be absorbing the moisture in your mask   in your room.,2
EMILY,,2
EMILY,"I still can't get over it, it really was mud. I mean, I know it said mud bath but I didn't really think they meant a real mud bath. And the odd thing is I should've been more repulsed by it. Sitting in a tub of hot dirt, which is basically what mud is, should've made me ill, and yet I really enjoyed it. Did yours have twigs? Mine had twigs, and when I asked the woman about them, she told me they were there because of the healing qualities. . .",2
EMILY,,2
MASSEURory,How's the pressure   too much?,2
LORELAI,Yup.,2
MASSEURory,"Sorry, I'll go lighter.",2
EMILY,"Your hands are amazing. Compliment your masseur's hands, Lorelai.",2
LORELAI,Oh my God.,2
EMILY,Excuse me?,2
LORELAI,Nothing.,2
EMILY,"You were muttering under your breath. Years of experience have taught me that when you do that, it's usually about me.",2
LORELAI,"Mom, you signed us up for a couple's massage.",2
EMILY,So?,2
LORELAI,A couple's massage is for a couple   not a couple of people.,2
EMILY,It's more efficient this way. We'll both be finished at the same time.,2
LORELAI,"Mom, do you know what most people who get these massages do about five minutes after it's over? They have sex, together, probably while wearing their robes.",2
EMILY,"Could the two of you excuse us for a moment please? Thank you. Well, that was appalling!",2
LORELAI,"Well, that was true!",2
EMILY,"You're just determined to spoil this, aren't you, Lorelai?",2
LORELAI,"Why, because I want a quiet, private massage?",2
EMILY,You've been pouting and sulking and sighing.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, I have not been sighing.",2
EMILY,"Rolling your eyes, mumbling.",2
LORELAI,"Well, that's how I detox.",2
EMILY,"Ever since we got here, you've made it your mission to be as miserable as possible.",2
LORELAI,That's not true.,2
EMILY,"It's completely true. And if you don't care that you're hurting my feelings, maybe you care that you're wasting all your relaxing time acting like a petulant four-year-old.",2
LORELAI,"Well, I'm sorry.",2
EMILY,Do you want me to try to get myself another room?,2
LORELAI,No.,2
EMILY,I saw a supply closet down the hall. Maybe my masseur could finish me in there.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, Mom.",2
EMILY,"Or perhaps I could just roll myself against a stucco wall, eliminate the need for a masseur altogether.",2
LORELAI,"Lie down Mom, please.",2
EMILY,If you say so. Lorelai?,2
LORELAI,"Yes, Mom?",2
EMILY,,2
RORY,"No, that's two orders of garlic gnon, three simosas, and a chicken vindiloo. And rice, and the green sauce, and no salad, and. . . oh wait, sorry. Can you hold on a sec? Hello?",2
LORELAI,"Hi, this is Phil's Liquor. I'm supposed to be delivering a keg there tonight.",2
RORY,"Hold on. Hi, sorry. Yeah, that's it. Forty minutes, great. Bye. Hey.",2
LORELAI,Who was that?,2
RORY,Sandeep's.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, you're ordering the Indian food?",2
RORY,Yup.,2
LORELAI,"Good, enjoy. Can you burn the house down afterward,  cause that's the only way we'll get the smell out.",2
RORY,Absolutely. How's the spa?,2
LORELAI,Tranquil.,2
RORY,Really?,2
LORELAI,"I wasn't done. Tranquilizers, uh, will be required if I have to spend one more minute with my mother.",2
RORY,Please tell me you're at least trying to get along with her?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, hey, I'm being a peach.",2
RORY,Really?,2
LORELAI,"Well, I smell like a peach. Was that the doorbell?",2
RORY,"Yeah, I'll call you later.",2
LORELAI,"Oh wait, I wanna find out who it is.",2
RORY,"The sooner you get back to your weekend, the sooner it'll be over.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, but before you go, can you get out my address book and count how many friends I have? I'll wait.",2
RORY,Bye.,2
LORELAI,Mean!,2
RORY,Steal me soap! Paris. What -.,2
PARIS,"I tried to stay home an d study myself but I can't. I don't know what anything means anymore. I mean, I can't even read my own handwriting. What does this say? The person who wrote this should be dressed in a clown suit stuffing bodies under their porch. You're in your pajamas.",2
RORY,I know.,2
PARIS,This was the big night you had planned   a rendezvous with Mr. Peanut?,2
RORY,Well...,2
PARIS,You're doing laundry.,2
RORY,Yes.,2
PARIS,You're doing laundry in your pajamas.,2
RORY,My mom is out of town and I never get the house all to myself.,2
PARIS,"You mean you never get to go months on end without seeing your parents, just getting anoccasional postcard that doesn't even have a courtesy ""Wish you were here"" written on it? That does suck. Don't let me stand in your way.",2
RORY,"Paris, wait.",2
PARIS,"No, forget it, I don't want to get in the way of your big night. I hear there's gonna be some hot knitting going on later.",2
RORY,"Fine, I'll study with you.",2
PARIS,You will?,2
RORY,"For one hour, that's it. We can do a quick review and a pop quiz and then you are going home. Deal?",2
PARIS,Deal.,2
RORY,"Okay, so, go sit on the couch. I'll be out in the minute.",2
PARIS,Where are you going?,2
RORY,I'm going to go change.,2
PARIS,,2
EMILY,Are you ready?,2
LORELAI,"Wow, you look great, Mom.",2
EMILY,Are you being sarcastic?,2
LORELAI,"No, I'm being completely serious.",2
EMILY,"Oh, well, thank you. That's a pretty color. What is that?",2
LORELAI,It's called Vicious Trollop.,2
EMILY,"Oh, stop it! Now why would you name a lipstick something like that?",2
LORELAI, Cause  dirty whore' was taken?,2
EMILY,You frighten me.,2
LORELAI,You wanna try some?,2
EMILY,"No, thank you.",2
LORELAI,"Go on, Mom, try it.",2
EMILY,It won't look good on me.,2
LORELAI,Sure it will.,2
EMILY,"Well, all right, but if I look ridiculous. . .",2
LORELAI,"I'll be the first one to point it out. You're a vicious trollop, you're a vicious trollop.",2
EMILY,Lorelai.,2
LORELAI,Sorry.,2
EMILY,Well?,2
LORELAI,I like it.,2
EMILY,You do? I like it too.,2
LORELAI,"Good, let's go then, I'm starving.",2
EMILY,"Oh, me too. What are they serving for dinner tonight?",2
LORELAI,"Well, let's see. Hmm.",2
EMILY,"They certainly do like their tofu here, don't they?",2
LORELAI,"And the word steamed. Well, they have dessert at least. Cookies sweetened with sprouted mungbean.",2
EMILY,That sounds dreadful.,2
LORELAI,"Yes, it does.",2
EMILY,"Where are you going? You aren't going to change, are you? Our seating's in ten minutes.",2
LORELAI,Get your coat.,2
EMILY,I don't need a coat to go to the dining room.,2
LORELAI,We're not going to the dining room.,2
EMILY,"Well, where are we going?",2
LORELAI,Out.,2
EMILY,Out where?,2
LORELAI,"We're gonna leave the spa, find a restaurant, and have a steak.",2
EMILY,A steak?,2
LORELAI,Who's gonna stop us?,2
EMILY,A steak.,2
LORELAI,"Come on, Mom. What's it gonna be   vicious trollop or the wide world of mungbeans?",2
EMILY,Let's go.,2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,"So, given that those are the reactions occurring in the two half-cells, what do you do next?",2
PARIS,"Well, if we add them together, doubling the coefficients of the silver half equation but not the voltage, we get the equation for the complete reaction.",2
RORY,"Well, you're in much better shape than you wanna think you are.",2
PARIS,Impossible. Where are you going?,2
RORY,That's my food.,2
PARIS,"Another half hour, please!",2
RORY,"No, you got your hour. You need to go.",2
PARIS,But   .,2
RORY,Go!,2
PARIS,Fine.,2
JESS,Delivery.,2
RORY,What are you doing here?,2
JESS,"Well, Luke figured since you're along tonight that maybe you wouldn't have any food in the house, so he sent over a care package.",2
RORY,I don't need a care package. I ordered food from Sandeep's.,2
JESS,Really? Planning on burning down the house afterwards?,2
RORY,Jess.,2
JESS,The only way to k*ll the smell. Where should I put this?,2
RORY,Well. . .,2
JESS,Kitchen?,2
RORY,Um. . .sure.,2
RORY,"God, how much food is in there? This could feed twelve.",2
JESS,"Excuse me, I've seen you eat.",2
RORY,"Fine, six.",2
JESS,"Yeah, well, he wanted you taken care of. He wasn't sure how long your mom was gonna be gone for.",2
RORY,Just tonight.,2
JESS,"Oh, he didn't know that.",2
RORY,"Well, now you can tell him.",2
JESS,I will.,2
RORY,So how come Caes ar didn't bring this over?,2
JESS,I volunteered.,2
RORY,Why?,2
JESS,Just wanted to get out of the construction zone. There's nothing but banging and yelling. That place gives me a h eadache.,2
RORY,Oh.,2
JESS,Why   did you think I wanted to come over here and see you?,2
RORY,No.,2
JESS,Just needed some quiet.,2
RORY,Fine.,2
JESS,That is all.,2
RORY,Got it.,2
JESS,Clear my head.,2
RORY,I understand.,2
JESS,"So, aren't you gonna eat?",2
RORY,Eventually.,2
JESS,It gets cold fast.,2
RORY,I can heat it up.,2
JESS,Reheated French fries really suck.,2
RORY,"Hm, they do suck.",2
JESS,"Yeah, so, eat.",2
RORY,"Okay, I will. You're still standing there.",2
JESS,I know. You didn't give me a t ip.,2
RORY,You want money?,2
JESS,"No, I'll take a fry though.",2
RORY,"Okay, yeah, have as much as you want.",2
JESS,"Okay, great.",2
RORY,What are you doing?,2
JESS,Getting ready to eat.,2
RORY,You're staying?,2
JESS,Didn't you just invite me?,2
RORY,"No, I -.",2
JESS,"No, you told me to have all I wanted. That sounded invitation-like.",2
RORY,You wanna stay here and eat?,2
JESS,Beats being at Luke's.,2
RORY,But   .,2
PARIS,I can't find my flashcards.,2
JESS,I didn't know you had company.,2
RORY,This is Paris. We were just studying.,2
JESS,Huh.,2
PARIS,"Don't worry, I was just leaving. If you find my flashcards, call me, okay?",2
RORY,No.,2
PARIS,What?,2
RORY,Stay for dinner.,2
PARIS,But I thought. . .,2
RORY,"We have a ton of food, and we can go over the notes more later.",2
PARIS,You're sure?,2
RORY,Positive.,2
PARIS,Is that mac and cheese?,2
RORY,It sure is.,2
PARIS,I love mac and cheese.,2
RORY,Great.,2
PARIS,I'm not allowed to have mac and cheese.,2
RORY,"Splurge. Come on Paris, stay.",2
PARIS,Do you have a twenty-four hour pharmacy just in case I have an allergic reaction to something?,2
RORY,"Believe it or not, we do.",2
PARIS,"Okay, can I borrow your phone?",2
RORY,It's by the door.,2
JESS,Interesting.,2
RORY,What is?,2
JESS,You think we need a chaperone?,2
RORY,"No, I don't.",2
JESS,You just invited one.,2
RORY,I'm just being polite. Paris is alone tonight and you yourself just said we have enough food for six.,2
JESS,"With me ar ound, it's down to four.",2
RORY,"With Paris around, it's down to two.",2
JESS,Works out well.,2
RORY,I think so.,2
PARIS,,2
EMILY,"My goodness, look at this place.",2
LORELAI,"I bet there's no cucumber slices in the water here. Hi there, party of two.",2
HOSTESS,"Okay. Uh, well, I can take your name, but I probably won't have a table for about an hour.",2
LORELAI,An hour!,2
EMILY,I can't wait an hour.,2
LORELAI,Me either.,2
EMILY,I'll pass out.,2
LORELAI,"Go first, you can break my fall.",2
EMILY,Can we bribe you?,2
HOSTESS,Sorry.,2
LORELAI,Please? She's loaded.,2
EMILY,Lorelai!,2
HOSTESS,"You know, a couple of stools just opened up at the bar, and we do serve our entire menu there.",2
LORELAI,That is a great idea. Thanks. Come on.,2
EMILY,We cannot eat dinner at a bar.,2
LORELAI,"I don't wanna wait an hour, and I'm wearing the wrong shoes for a drive thru.",2
EMILY,But what are people going to think?,2
LORELAI,That we're loose women with questionable morals.,2
EMILY,Doesn't seem right to eat dinner when your feet aren't touching the floor.,2
BARTENDERory,What can I get you ladies?,2
LORELAI,"Hi Steve, nice to meet you. We will have two. . .martinis?",2
EMILY,Why not?,2
LORELAI,"Two vodka martinis, straight up with a twist, very dry, very cold, and a couple of menus, please.",2
EMILY,And some peanuts.,2
LORELAI,"Ah, peanuts, good idea.",2
BARTENDERory,"Here you go, I'll get your drinks.",2
LORELAI,"Thank you. You're a good man, Steve. Okay, I'm thinking steak and Caesar salad if it's not too anchovy-y, and hey   do you wanna split a shrimp cocktail to start?",2
EMILY,That sounds fine.,2
LORELAI,"Ah, I just love the idea of shrimp cocktail with a steak dinner, you know? It's so Casino, Big Joe, steak and shrimp   hey, save some for winter, there.",2
EMILY,I never realized how wonderful peanuts were before.,2
BARTENDERory,Want a refill?,2
EMILY,"Oh, yes, please.",2
LORELAI,"Cheers, Mom.",2
EMILY,"Cheers. I must tell you, I never expected this.",2
LORELAI,What?,2
EMILY,Me inhaling peanuts at a singles bar.,2
LORELAI,"This isn't a singles bar, Mom. It's a sixty-forty bar.",2
EMILY,A what?,2
LORELAI,"Sixty-year-old men hitting on forty-year-old women, divorcees mostly.",2
EMILY,Really?,2
LORELAI,Look around.,2
EMILY,"Hm. Oh, now, she can do better than that. What does she see in him?",2
LORELAI,"Big will, short life span, the usual draw. Hey Mom.",2
EMILY,"I wonder if they have pretzels, too.",2
LORELAI,"Don't look now, but I think you're passing for a forty-year-old woman.",2
EMILY,What?,2
LORELAI,"Two o'clock, silver fox, totally checking you out.",2
EMILY,"Oh, he is not.",2
LORELAI,"Well, he's not staring at Steve.",2
EMILY,You're being ridiculous. He's definitely not looking at me.,2
LORELAI,He's still looking.,2
EMILY,,2
PARIS,A tragic waste of paper.,2
JESS,I can't believe you just said that.,2
PARIS,"Well, it's true, the Beat's writing was completely self-indulgent. I have one word for Jack Kerouac   edit.",2
JESS,"It was not self-indulgent. The Beats believed in shocking people, stirring things up.",2
PARIS,"They believed in dr*gs, booze, and petty crime.",2
RORY,"Well, then you can say that they exposed you to a world you wouldn't have otherwise known. Isn't that what great writing's all about?",2
PARIS,That was not great writing. That was the National Enquirer of the fifties.,2
JESS,You're cracked.,2
PARIS,"Typical guy response. Worship Kerouac and Bukowski, God forbid you'd pick up anything by Jane Austen.",2
JESS,"Hey, I've read Jane Austen.",2
PARIS,You have?,2
JESS,"Yeah, and I think she would've liked Bukowski.",2
PARIS,What are you doing?,2
JESS,Salt and pepper dip. Only way to eat a fry.,2
PARIS,Really?,2
RORY,It's fast food gospel.,2
PARIS,"Mm. That's good. That's really, really good.",2
JESS,You like hot sauce?,2
PARIS,I don't know. Should I?,2
JESS,I think it's wise.,2
RORY,Hello?,2
DEAN,Hey.,2
RORY,"Oh, hey. Where are you?",2
DEAN,On my way to see you   if that's okay?,2
RORY,"Oh, well -",2
DEAN,"I know you wanna be alone, so I'll only stay a minute. I just wanna say hi.",2
RORY,We just said hi.,2
DEAN,"Well, I wanna say hi a little closer.",2
RORY,"But, I'm a mess, really. It's not pretty. You won't recognize me.",2
DEAN,"Well, then put a name tag on  cause I miss you.",2
RORY,"I miss you too, but  ",2
DEAN,But what?,2
RORY,But. . .Paris is here.,2
DEAN,Why?,2
RORY,"She freaked out about a grade and she wanted to go over some notes, and you know Paris   she will not be denied.",2
DEAN,"Okay, then I'm not really ruining your alone night, someone else did that.",2
RORY,"Yes, but  ",2
DEAN,I'll see you in a sec.,2
JESS,"I can't get into poetry. It's kind of like, geez, just say it already, we're dying here.",2
RORY,"Wow, you know, I just noticed the time, and it's getting really late.",2
JESS,It's seven o'clock.,2
RORY,"I know, but Paris and I still have a lot more studying to do. Jess, please thank Luke for me. It was really nice of him.",2
JESS,Who was on the phone?,2
RORY,No one.,2
JESS,"No one wouldn't happen to be heading over here now, would he?",2
RORY,Jess.,2
PARIS,What's going on?,2
RORY,Nothing.,2
JESS,Dean's on his way over and Rory doesn't want him to find me here.,2
RORY,Why?,2
JESS,"Yeah, why?",2
RORY,You know why.,2
JESS,We're just eating dinner.,2
RORY,"Jess, I'm asking you as a friend, just please leave now.",2
JESS,You really want me to go?,2
RORY,I really wanna avoid a fight with Dean.,2
JESS,"Okay, I'm going.",2
RORY,Thank you.,2
JESS,Ow!,2
RORY,What?,2
JESS,Ooh! I just twisted my ankle. I better go lie down.,2
RORY,Jess!,2
JESS,"God, you're no fun when you're tense. Are you sure you want me to go?  Cause maybe this whole thing can be solved between me and Dean if we just sat down and had a little heart to heart. He can tell me his issues, I'll tell him mine.",2
RORY,Jess!,2
JESS,I promise I'll speak slowly.,2
RORY,Bye!,2
JESS,"Okay, well, give him my best, would ya? Actually, I guess I could do that myself.",2
RORY,"Dean, Jess just came by to bring me some food.",2
JESS,From Luke's.,2
RORY,He wanted to make sure I ate.,2
JESS,Luke did.,2
RORY,"Right, Luke did.",2
JESS,"Personally, I could care less if she eats.",2
RORY,"Yeah, true, he could care less.",2
JESS,"I see you brought a little something, too. Is that ice cream? That's so nice. A tiny little ice cream package just big enough for two. Hey, are you guys gonna feed each other  cause that's just so darn cute. Oops. You're doing that towering over me thing. Huh. I tell you, you've really got that down. It helps that you're twelve feet tall, but this Frankenstein scowl really adds to the whole   .",2
RORY,Jess.,2
JESS,"Okay, I'm going. Look, man, I really was just dropping off some food, so don't get all West Side Story on me, okay?",2
RORY,"So, do you wanna. . . . . .come in?",2
DEAN,What the hell is going on?,2
PARIS,Hi.,2
RORY,"Dean, you rememb er Paris, right?",2
DEAN,"Yeah, hi. So Jess just dropped this off, huh?",2
RORY,"Oh, well. . .",2
DEAN,"Now I know you eat fast, but this is a lot of food to put away that quickly, even on your best day.",2
RORY,"Okay, so he didn't just drop it off but - .",2
DEAN,You told me you were doing laundry tonight.,2
RORY,I was.,2
DEAN,And now you are here with Jess.,2
RORY,And Paris!,2
DEAN,"Jess, Rory!",2
RORY,"Ah, well, I swear, I didn't  ",2
DEAN,You didn't what? You didn't know he was coming over?,2
RORY,I didn't.,2
DEAN,"And you also didn't know he was gonna stay, right?",2
RORY,It just happened.,2
DEAN,How does that just happen?,2
RORY,"Well, he was. . .and the diner, the diner was. . .and I. . .",2
DEAN,And you what? What? Say something!,2
RORY,Stop yelling!,2
DEAN,You totally lied to me!,2
RORY,I didn't!,2
DEAN,"Turn the situation around, Rory! How's it looking?",2
RORY,It's looking complicated and I'm trying to explain it to you.,2
DEAN,"Ugh, that's crap.",2
PARIS,It's my fault.,2
DEAN,What?,2
PARIS,"It's my fault that Jess was here. I saw him in the diner the day I came to Stars Hollow and I thought he was cute and since I'm not great at the whole  batting the eyelashes, look at my belly shirt' kind of thing, I asked Rory to help me. I thought if she could maybe get him over here, we'd have a chance to talk and. . .I don't know, it seems totally stupid now and it obviously didn't work  shock, but that's why he was here. Thanks for trying to cover for me.",2
RORY,That's okay.,2
PARIS,"Anyway, I should get going. I'm probably gonna break out in some sort of rash any second now.",2
DEAN,So Paris likes Jess?,2
RORY,Yeah.,2
DEAN,"Rory, is this true?",2
RORY,Yes it is.,2
DEAN,Paris and Jess?,2
RORY,"I know. There's no explaining attraction. Dean, listen to me, if I was going to have anyone over tonight, it definitely would've been you.",2
DEAN,Okay.,2
RORY,Really?,2
DEAN,"Well, if you say so, then I have to believe it, don't I?",2
RORY,Yes.,2
DEAN,"Well, okay then. I'm sorry that I yelled.",2
RORY,Completely justified under the circumstances.,2
DEAN,I'm gonna get going.,2
RORY,"No, wait, don't you wanna stay for ice cream? We could hang out.",2
DEAN,"Nah, I'm just gonna go.",2
RORY,"I'm still seeing you tomorrow, right?",2
DEAN,"Yeah, sure.",2
RORY,Hey.,2
DEAN,See you tomorrow.,2
RORY,What was that?,2
PARIS,What?,2
RORY,"That, the story, the save? You helped me. Why would you do that?",2
PARIS,"I don't know, it just came out.",2
RORY,You have no idea what you did.,2
PARIS,It was no big deal.,2
RORY,"No, it was a very big deal. It was a huge deal.",2
PARIS,"Well, you helped me tonight when you didn't want to, so I owed you.",2
RORY,Thank you.,2
PARIS,"You're welcome. Okay, well, I'll let you get back to your alone night.",2
RORY,You should stay.,2
PARIS,Stay?,2
RORY,"Yeah. We could hang out, maybe watch some TV. You can even spend the night if you don't wanna drive all the way back to Hartford.",2
PARIS,"Spend the night, like a slumber party?",2
RORY,Sort of.,2
PARIS,"You're just doing this because I lied to Dean for you, right?",2
RORY,I'm doing this because it's what you do with friends.,2
PARIS,We're friends?,2
RORY,"I'm not sure if there is an exact definition for what we are, but I do think it falls somewhere in the bizarro friends-ish realm. Come on, stay.",2
PARIS,"Okay. But if you're doing all this so you can freeze my bra, I'll k*ll you.",2
RORY,,2
EMILY,"This is either the greatest steak I've ever eaten, or I'm so hungry, I'm delirious. Pass the horseradish, please.",2
LORELAI,I never knew you were a spicy girl.,2
EMILY,"Oh, believe me, I can handle my heat. One summer when we were first married, your father and I stayed at this little village in Thailand where we spent two weeks eating viciously hot chilies and skinny-dipping.",2
LORELAI,"Ah, Mom!",2
EMILY,"Well, you certainly couldn't put your clothes on after eating those things.",2
LORELAI,Stop it! I like to think of parents the old fashioned way   separate bedrooms. FEMALE,2
SINGERory,And now it's time for my favorite part of the evening   our salute to the Chairmanof the Board. MALE,2
SINGERory,I sure hope that's not b-o-r-e-d.,2
LORELAI,"Uh, uh, Mom?",2
EMILY,Yes?,2
LORELAI,Rememb er the man who wasn't staring at you?,2
EMILY,He wasn't staring at me.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, well, he's coming over.",2
EMILY,What?,2
CHAD,"Excuse me, I hope I'm not interrupting, but I couldn't help but notice that you two are having more fun than anyone at the bar.",2
LORELAI,"Well, that's true, we are.",2
CHAD,"Well, good, I've come to the right place. Hi, I'm Chad.",2
LORELAI,"Hi Chad. I'm Lorelai. This is my mother, Emily.",2
CHAD,Your mother?,2
LORELAI,"Chad, if the next words out of your mouth are,  you can't possibly be old enough to be her mother,' I'm gonna have to cause you severe physical pain.",2
CHAD,"Emily, do you share this rather extreme opinion?",2
EMILY,I think I'll stay out of it.,2
CHAD,"In that case, let me just say that I think you look more like sisters than mother and daughter. Yeah, I went for a variation.",2
LORELAI,I'll let it slide this time.,2
CHAD,"So, are you two, uh, local or just visiting?",2
LORELAI,"Visiting. Mom's from Hartford and I'm from a town, uh  ",2
CHAD,"Hartford? Great town, great town. A little of the old, little of the new. You like living there?",2
EMILY,"Well, yes, I do.",2
LORELAI,"And how about you, Chad   where do you live?",2
CHAD,"Here   and by here, I mean this very bar stool.",2
LORELAI,"Wow, admitting right off the bat that you spend your life at a bar. Do you find that people are impressed by that?",2
CHAD,Until now.,2
EMILY,"Oh, I love this song.",2
CHAD,It's a great song for dancing.,2
EMILY,"Yes, it is.",2
CHAD,"Help me out here, will ya?",2
LORELAI,"I think he's asking you to dance, Mom.",2
EMILY,"What? Oh, no, I, uh, I couldn't.",2
CHAD,Rumor has it you love this song.,2
EMILY,"Oh, well, yes, but I don't dance.",2
CHAD,"Oh, come on. I can't believe that.",2
EMILY,And I shouldn't leave my daughter alone.,2
LORELAI,That's okay. The sitter'll be here any minute.,2
EMILY,"Really, I'm serious, you should ask someone else.",2
CHAD,Is it my dancing? Because you two could work out some kind of  save me' signal in case I really embarrass you.,2
LORELAI,"Go ahead, Mom. It'll be fun.",2
CHAD,"Come on, the song's almost over. You'll hardly have to spend any time at all with me.",2
EMILY,All right.,2
BARTENDERory,"Hey, your mom looks good out there.",2
LORELAI,"Yup, she sure does.",2
EMILY,"I'm sorry, I have to go.",2
LORELAI,"Mom, what's wrong?",2
EMILY,We're leaving.,2
LORELAI,What happened?,2
EMILY,I shouldn't have been doing this.,2
LORELAI,Doing what?,2
EMILY,Fraternizing with other men.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, what are you talking about?",2
EMILY,I practically cheated on your father.,2
LORELAI,You did not cheat on Dad.,2
EMILY,I danced with another man.,2
LORELAI,You've danced with other men before.,2
EMILY,"Not like that, not without your father present.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, Mom, it was just a dance. You were having fun.",2
EMILY,I need to get out of here. How hard is it to find a coat?,2
LORELAI,"Mom, you didn't do anything wrong.",2
EMILY,I don't know why I let you take me to this chop house in the first place. I don't go to chop houses. What were you thinking?,2
LORELAI,Need food now.,2
EMILY,And I certainly don't eat at bars. Hookers eat at bars.,2
LORELAI,Only if they can't get a table.,2
EMILY,You're not funny. You knew this whole evening made me uncomfortable and yet you kept pushing.,2
LORELAI,"I was trying to do everything right. You manipulated me into taking this trip and still I came. You told me I was acting like a teenager, so I tried to be nicer. You said you needed to eat, so I made that happen.",2
EMILY,"Yes, by sitting me at a bar where you practically forced me to engage in inappropriate behavior.",2
LORELAI,What?,2
EMILY,You let me get sixty-fortied!,2
LORELAI,"You are crazy! Do you know that? We were having dinner, Mom, a nice dinner. We were talking. Hell, we were having fun.",2
EMILY,"Oh, so watching your mother make an ass of herself was fun for you?",2
LORELAI,"God, you know, you don't have any right to complain about this relationship if you're not willing to let your guard down once in awhile and just be normal.",2
EMILY,,2
LORELAI,Come in .,2
EMILY,I called the bellman to get the bags. He said it would be around ten minutes.,2
LORELAI,Okay.,2
EMILY,Thank you for agreeing to leave early.,2
LORELAI,No problem.,2
EMILY,I guess this whole thing was a silly idea anyway. I don't know why I pushed it. We can't even get through a dinner without a fight. What was I thinking putting us together for a weekend?,2
LORELAI,"It was a nice thought, Mom.",2
EMILY,"Yes, well, I guess it's the thought that counts, isn't it?",2
LORELAI,"You know, if you want, um, I can just bring our bags down. I mean, they're not that heavy, and then we don't have to wait.",2
EMILY,"Well, that sounds fine. Why can't we have what you and Rory have?",2
LORELAI,Rory and I are different mom.,2
EMILY,"We're mother and daughter, you're mother and daughter. It shouldn't be that different.",2
LORELAI,It's completely different. It couldn't be more different.,2
EMILY,But why?,2
LORELAI,I grew up in a different environment.,2
EMILY,You mean an oppressive environment.,2
LORELAI,"No, Mom, I mean a different environment. And plus, I was so young when I had Rory.",2
EMILY,"So because I waited until I was grown and married, I can't have a relationship with my daughter?",2
LORELAI,No.,2
EMILY,"Well, then, why?",2
LORELAI,"Rory and I are best friends, Mom. We are best friends first and mother and daughter second, and you and I are mother and daughter always.",2
EMILY,I wasn't taught to be best friends with my daughter.,2
LORELAI,I know.,2
EMILY,I was taught to be a role model for my daughter.,2
LORELAI,"I know that, too.",2
EMILY,"I did what I thought was right. I did what I thought I had to do to protect you, and because of this we have no relationship.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, Mom, we have a relationship.",2
EMILY,We do? What? What is our relationship?,2
LORELAI,"Well, we. . .",2
EMILY,Exactly.,2
LORELAI,Maybe an intense weekend together was not the best idea for us. Maybe we need to start with something simpler.,2
EMILY,"Like what, a brisk walk around the block?",2
LORELAI,"No, I hate exercise.",2
EMILY,"Oh, well, as long as you find this amusing.",2
LORELAI,"Mom, come on. There has to be something else. Something small.",2
EMILY,"Like what? Where are you going? Lorelai, you just don't walk out on a person. That's rude. That's a robe.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, this is my robe. And I want you to go into your room and get your robe. And then, exactly at the same time, we are gonna shove these robes in our suitcases and we are gonna walk out that door and leave with them.",2
EMILY,That's stealing.,2
LORELAI,"Yes, it is.",2
EMILY,You want me to steal a robe? That's how we're going to bond?,2
LORELAI,"Mom, you love this robe. You've talked about nothing else except this robe since we got here, so this robe will be symbolic of our trip together.",2
EMILY,"But that's crazy. As soon as they check the rooms, they're going to know the robes are gone and then they're going to charge our credit card.",2
LORELAI,"Well, how do you know?",2
EMILY,Because that's what the little tag on the hanger says.,2
LORELAI,"Well, the little tag on the hanger could be right, or the little tag on the hanger could just be there trying to scare us away from trying. Either way, whether we get away with it or not, it's something we did, you and I.",2
EMILY,You're serious.,2
LORELAI,I am folding this robe up.,2
EMILY,Lorelai.,2
LORELAI,I am putting this robe in my bag.,2
EMILY,That's lunacy.,2
LORELAI,I am zipping up the bag that contains the robe.,2
EMILY,I have a perfectly good robe at home.,2
LORELAI,"Now the only question is, am I doing it alone?",2
EMILY,Did you ever steal a robe with Rory?,2
LORELAI,"No, Rory would never steal. She's far too moral for that. You, however, vicious trollop   what's it gonna be?",2
EMILY,I should have my head examined.,2
LORELAI,We'll make an appointment when we get back.,2
EMILY,"You do know, in the course of one night, you've turned me into an adulterer and a thief.",2
LORELAI,I'll have you working at the chicken ranch by the end of the month.,2
EMILY,,2
RORY,You actually got Grandma to steal a bathrobe?,2
LORELAI,Although I did catch her trying to return it while I was getting the car.,2
RORY,Still.,2
LORELAI,"I know, life with my mother, one step forward, five thousand steps back. It's kinda like the spastic polka.",2
KIRK,"Excuse me, are you done?",2
LORELAI,"No, uh, sorry, not yet.",2
KIRK,"So, you're gonna eat that half a piece of bacon that's been sitting there for ten minutes?",2
LORELAI,Kirk.,2
KIRK,"I mean, of course, you must be if you're saying you're not done because that's the only thing left in front on you, unless you eat plates.",2
LORELAI,Go away.,2
KIRK,You are hogging the table.,2
LORELAI,"You keep it up, I'm ordering seconds.",2
KIRK,Fine.,2
LORELAI,"So, Paris looked a little green this morning.",2
RORY,"Yeah, she had a sugar/carb hangover of monumental proportions.",2
LORELAI,"People don't realize it, but it takes years of training to be able to eat the way we do.",2
RORY,Don't I know it.,2
LORELAI,"So, what's on the agenda for today?",2
RORY,"Let's see. Dean, Dean, and uh. . .oh, did I mention Dean?",2
LORELAI,"Wow, he must've been crazy mad last night.",2
RORY,I'd say that was a fair assessment.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, I gotta get to the inn.",2
RORY,"Okay. Well, I'm probably gonna have dinner with Dean, so. . .",2
LORELAI,"I'll have the house to myself tonight. Life's funny, isn't it?",2
RORY,I simply cannot stop laughing. I'll get the check.,2
LORELAI,Thanks hon.,2
RORY,Hey Luke.,2
LUKE,"What, you find a nail in your food? I swear to God, Tom, you are dead! You hear me? Dead!",2
RORY,"There's nothing wrong with the food, Luke.",2
LUKE,"Oh, sorry Tom.",2
RORY,I just wanted to thank you.,2
LUKE,"Yeah, for what?",2
RORY,For the care package. It was really sweet of you.,2
LUKE,What care package?,2
JESS,"Hey Luke, I think they hit the water line again.",2
LUKE,"Oh, what? Tom, you are dead! You hear me? Dead!",2
RORY,"Huh, interesting.",2
JESS,"Hey, you wanna pay?",2
RORY,I don't think Luke knew anything about the food last night.,2
JESS,That'll be twelve-fifty.,2
RORY,,2
JESS,I don't have any quarters. I'm gonna have to give you nickels.,2
RORY,Now why would you lie about something like that?,2
JESS,Here's your change. Come ag ain soon.,2
RORY,You wanted to come over.,2
JESS,I have to get back to work.,2
RORY,You're squirming. I've never seen you squirm. It's entertaining.,2
JESS,Oh yeah?,2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,"Dean, hey.",2
DEAN,Hey.,2
LORELAI,Rory's just inside paying. She's coming out to meet you after.,2
DEAN,"Yeah, we're gonna spend the day together.",2
LORELAI,That's great.,2
DEAN,"Yeah, it is.",2
LORELAI,"So, listen, Rory told me ev erything that happened last night. She feels just terrible about it.",2
DEAN,I know.,2
LORELAI,"Good, you should. It's just one of those freaky unfortunate things that happens.",2
DEAN,"Freaky and unfortunate, yeah.",2
LORELAI,"She had nothing to do with Jess coming over. Believe me, she did not want him there.",2
DEAN,"That's what she told me. And Rory wouldn't lie, right?",2

LORELAI,"Oh, that was close.",2
EMILY,"You are Rory are always out. What is it that you do? Is your house that awful you can't be in it? It's too much excitement, if you ask me. . .",2
LORELAI,"Well, what isn't in Emily's rules of conduct?",2
EMILY,"I don't want to talk to a machine, I'll just call you later.",2

EMILY,. . . it's at three o'clock and all the women are all extremely punctual.,2
LORELAI,"When I'm senile and ga-ga and drooling into a cup, and yet I can't remember my name, I'll still rememb er that your DAR meet ing is that Tuesday.",2
EMILY,. . . this Tuesday. I'll talk to you about some other things later.,2
Posted,04/28/02 04:48,2
LORELAI,I'm gonna have to be de-programmed by cult de-programmers to get that Tuesday out of my brain.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, we're not in, so   ah, bashed my thumb! Leave a message.",2
EMILY,Your phone message is annoying. . .,2
LORELAI,Unbelievable.,2
EMILY,Do you know how annoying it is?,2
LORELAI,I think I have a standard against which to measure it.,2
EMILY,. . .to it yourself. Have you heard it lately?,2
LORELAI,I can't because I'm amputating my ears.,2
EMILY,". . .and that thumb bashing thing, is that a joke? Why is it that your jokes are always. . .",2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,"Haven't you already tasted that one, Mom?",2
EMILY,Mm.,2
LORELAI,"Twice, you've tasted that soup twice.",2
EMILY,You're keeping a running count?,2
LORELAI,I'm mo rbidly fascinated.,2
EMILY,"Well, Lorelai, when you're tasting anything, the first taste acclimates the palate, the second establishes the foundation, and the third is to make your decision.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, there's going to be a third taste.",2
EMILY,Isn't that what this is for   to taste the soups?,2
LORELAI,"Taste them, yes, not to orally deduce their chemical structures.",2
EMILY,Everything has to be at your pace.,2
LORELAI,Or at a pace that can't be measured by the number of times the earth circles the sun.,2
SOOKIE,"You know, actually, I've heard that.",2
LORELAI,What?,2
SOOKIE,"One is to acclimate, two is for foundation, and three to judge.",2
LORELAI,Traitor.,2
EMILY,"The women in my DAR group are very picky. My God, when the pate at the meeting Heddy Cubbington organized was slightly less chilled than appropriate, she was ostracized for a month.",2
LORELAI,"Well, that hussy Heddy had it coming.",2
EMILY,Lorelai.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, gosh, they're on time for once, good. Hey, do me a favor and, uh, tell Michel that on Wednesday. . .",2
EMILY,"Lorelai, please.",2
LORELAI,"Thanks. Um, Mom, I got a lot of other things happening here that can't come to a grinding halt for this.",2
EMILY,So your full attention for a short period is too much to ask for?,2
LORELAI,"Mom, I'm already giving you more attention than I would someone in these circumstances. No one else would get eight separate soups to taste for a lousy DAR. . .sorry, a not lousy DAR meet ing. We only do this for weddings.",2
EMILY,"Well, would you like me to pay for the tasting?",2
LORELAI,"No, Mom, just decide in this calendar year.",2
SOOKIE,"Hey, can I. . .I'm sorry. The mushroom is a great choice. It's super popular, and it's my Jackson's favorite.",2
EMILY,Whose?,2
SOOKIE,"Jackson, my fiancé.",2
EMILY,"Oh, you're getting married?",2
SOOKIE,To the best man in the world.,2
LORELAI,"Oh hey, while we're on the subject, um, bridesmaids outfits?",2
SOOKIE,"Ooh, I'm way ahead of you. I've already got a couple of ideas.",2
LORELAI,Is one of them having me design and make them so I don't secretly hate what you pick and then harbor a secret grudge against you for the rest of our lives?,2
SOOKIE,It is now.,2
LORELAI,I'll do it!,2
SOOKIE,We're a good team.,2
MICHELorelai,That fellow's on the phone from the restaurant.,2
LORELAI,Who?,2
MICHELorelai,The flannel man with the protruding ankles.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, Luke?",2
MICHELorelai,"I forgot his name from the desk to here, that's how memorable he is.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, thank you.",2
EMILY,Where are you going?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, to talk to Luke.",2
EMILY,Can't you call him back?,2
LORELAI,"Have your third taste, Mom.",2
EMILY,Lorelai! Is she always this scattered?,2
SOOKIE,She's the stablest person I know.,2
EMILY,"That's very sad. Well, I think you're right, mushroom.",2
SOOKIE,Great.,2
EMILY,"So, tell me mo re about your wedding.",2
SOOKIE,"Oh, I've just started planning so there's not that much to tell.",2
EMILY,"Well, have you decided on anything yet? The location or the music for the ceremony, maybe?",2
SOOKIE,"Oh, we'll probably just, you know, wind up playing something off a CD.",2
EMILY,Oh.,2
SOOKIE,What?,2
EMILY,"Well, CD's can be very unreliable. They break sometimes, or they skip, or the person assigned to turn them on and off gets distracted and the whole ceremony is ruined.",2
SOOKIE,I hadn't thought of that.,2
EMILY,Have you thought about live music?,2
SOOKIE,Well. . .,2
EMILY,A nice string ensemble.,2
SOOKIE,"Ooh, that sounds nice.",2
EMILY,There are a couple of wonderful groups I could recommend.,2
SOOKIE,"Sure. I mean, I guess it doesn't hurt to check them out.",2
EMILY,"No, it doesn't. Mushroom soup.",2
SOOKIE,,2
LORELAI,Luke?,2
LUKE,"Yeah, hi.",2
LORELAI,Hello.,2
LUKE,How's it going?,2
LORELAI,"Pretty good, pretty good. How's things with you?",2
LUKE,"Oh, not bad. Dropped some eg gs.",2
LORELAI,Bummer .,2
LUKE,Hazard of the business. Am I catching you at a bad time?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, no, it's kind of slow here. So slow, in fact, that Michel and I were about to get the tetherball out.",2
LUKE,That's the thing with a ball tethered to a rope?,2
LORELAI,"Hey, I never knew that's where the tether comes from.",2
LUKE,"Yeah, it's tethered. It's tied, like an anchor is tethered to a rope on a boat.",2
LORELAI,"Neat, neat.",2
LUKE,"Yeah, most people probably don't put that together.",2
LORELAI,Probably not.,2
LUKE,Yeah.,2
LORELAI,"So, anything else?",2
LUKE,"Uh, yeah, actually   if I needed a room or two for a couple of days, would that be possible?",2
LORELAI,You need rooms?,2
LUKE,Like nine.,2
LORELAI,You need nine rooms?,2
LUKE,"Just for a couple of days, Wednesday and Thursday.",2
LORELAI,"Uh, well, I can take care of that. What's it for?",2
LUKE,"Uh, just got some family coming in.",2
LORELAI,Reunion?  Cause we can get the tetherball out.,2
LUKE,"Nah, funeral.",2
LORELAI,What?,2
LUKE,"Yeah, my Uncle Louie died last night and I'm arranging the funeral for him.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, Luke, I'm so sorry. Here I was babbling about tetherball.",2
LUKE,And you weren't babbling.,2
LORELAI,"Well, you've got nine rooms, Wednesday and Thursday.",2
LUKE,You sure?,2
LORELAI,It's a done deal.,2
LUKE,Thanks.,2
LORELAI,"Luke, I'm so, so sorry.",2
LUKE,It's okay. It sounds like he went peaceful. He was eighty-five.,2
LORELAI,"But it's always hard. Um, are you okay?",2
LUKE,"Yeah, I'm okay.",2
LORELAI,Can I help you with anything else?,2
LUKE,"No, the rooms are help enough.",2
LORELAI,"Are you sure,  cause I'm dealing with my mom now and I'd be happy to rush over and help with whatever. You'd be doing me a f avor.",2
LUKE,"The rooms are all I need, thanks.",2
LORELAI,You're welcome.,2
LUKE,"Well, I gotta go.",2
LORELAI,Call if you need anything.,2
LUKE,"I will. By the way, that French guy's a putz.",2
LORELAI,"Oh yeah, he knows.",2
LUKE,"All right, see ya.",2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,It's so sad.,2
LORELAI,I know.,2
RORY,"Was Luke, like, shaken over his uncle dying?",2
LORELAI,I don't know. He's so unflappable. It's hard to tell.,2
RORY,,2
WOMAN,Can I get another cup of coffee?,2
LUKE,In a minute.,2
SY,"Hey, is that my food?",2
MAN,"More coffee here, too, please.",2
LUKE,In a minute.,2
SY,Is that my food?,2
KIRK,"More coffee for me, too.",2
LUKE,"Shut up, Kirk.",2
SY,Is that my food?,2
LUKE,"Yes, Sy, that's your food.",2
SY,"Well, can I have it?",2
LUKE,"I'm doing all I can here, folks.",2
KIRK,I asked nicely.,2
MAN,"Hey, hey, watch the cord!",2
LUKE,Try ducking.,2
KIRK,You should update to a cordless.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, whatcha doing? Watch, watch it.",2
LUKE,"Ah, buh buh buh. . .thanks, thanks, I'm on the phone.",2
LORELAI,We noticed.,2
LUKE,"Yeah, I can't serve and be on the phone.",2
RORY,"We noticed that, too.",2
LORELAI,But your reenactment of Jerry Lewis in The Diner Guy is gonna wow the critics.,2
RORY,Where should the poached eggs go?,2
LUKE,Crank in the hat.,2
SY,"Hey, I'm not a crank! You're a crank, crank!",2
RORY,He is a crank.,2
LORELAI,And the French toast?,2
LUKE,"Lady with the giant purse. Ah, yup.",2
MAN,This is not good.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, fall back cowboy.",2
LUKE,"Yo, whoa, whoa, whoa   what are you doing?",2
LORELAI,Come here. Just stay on the phone and give me these. Where do they go?,2
LUKE,Table by the window.,2
LORELAI,Don't you number your tables?,2
LUKE,No.,2
LORELAI,You should number your tables.,2
LUKE,"What good would that do? If I said a number, you wouldn't know what table was what number.",2
LORELAI,But all restaurants number their table. You should number your tables.,2
LUKE,"Table five, they go to table five.",2
LORELAI,Cool. Which one is that?,2
LUKE,Table by the window.,2
LORELAI,"By the window, Elma.",2
RORY,"Got it, Gertie.",2
KIRK,Hello? How 'bout that coffee?,2
LORELAI,I got it.,2
LUKE,Thanks.,2
KIRK,"But, but   mine's a quarter caf.",2
LORELAI,Huh?,2
KIRK,"Three-fourths decaf, one-fourth caffeinated.",2
LORELAI,I four-fourths don't care.,2
KIRK,Fill it up.,2
LUKE,Sorry about this.,2
LORELAI,It's okay.,2
LUKE,Sometimes you get the world's full of people who micromanage their lives to the point where they can't wait an extra second for anything.,2
LORELAI,We're running out of coffee.,2
LUKE,I'll make some mo re.,2
LORELAI,"No, I got it.",2
LUKE,Do you know how?,2
LORELAI,"Do I . . . ugh. . .I am Cat hy Coffee, mister, the bastard offspring of Mrs. Folger and Juan Valdez.",2
RORY,"Hey Luke, where's Jess?",2
LUKE,I don't know.,2
RORY,School?,2
LUKE,Please. He's probably upstairs.,2
RORY,Really? Excuse me.,2
LUKE,It's too strong.,2
LORELAI,"No, it's not.",2
LUKE,"No, it's too strong.",2
LORELAI,You're on the phone.,2
LUKE,Not everybody likes it that strong.,2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,"Jess, open up! I know you're in there.",2
JESS,"My, aren't we bright eyed and bushy tailed.",2
RORY,Luke needs you downstairs.,2
JESS,Why?,2
RORY,Because he's on the phone with someone and Caesar's off today and the place is packed and he needs help.,2
JESS,I'll be down in a minute.,2
RORY,"No, now.",2
JESS,I'm in the middle of something.,2
RORY,Just assume that Jeannie's gonna get Major Healey out of whatever scrape he's in.,2
JESS,,2
KIRK,I need some mo re Equal.,2
LORELAI,There's one right there.,2
KIRK,I need seven,2
LORELAI,"Seven? You're not squirreling these away in your pocket for home use, are you, Kirk?",2
KIRK,"No, I use seven in my coffee.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, good, then allow me. There you go. Go ahead and give that a taste, see if it's to your liking.",2
KIRK,Okay. Perfection.,2
LORELAI,Good.,2
LORELAI,"Well, you're very graceful.",2
JESS,She pushed me.,2
RORY,Sue me.,2
JESS,I could've broken my neck.,2
RORY,As long as it's not your arm. We need your arm.,2
JESS,Despot.,2
LUKE,"Took me twenty minutes to get pass this place's stupid busy signal, then they put me on hold forever.",2
LORELAI,Who's keeping you on hold?,2
LUKE,That mortuary in Florida where my uncle's at.,2
LORELAI,Florida? I thought he was in the area.,2
LUKE,"No no, he spent most of his life here but retired to Orlando, so I gotta ship the body back here.",2
LORELAI,"Aw, he wanted to be buried in Stars Hollow?",2
LUKE,"Nah, my dad wanted my uncle buried in Stars Hollow right next to him.",2
LORELAI,That's nice.,2
LUKE,"Well, they were really close, and Louie didn't have any wife or kids to look out for things and before my dad died, he asked me if I'd look out for him.",2
LORELAI,For Louie?,2
LUKE,"Yeah, he just wanted me to make sure he got a proper funeral. You know, respectful, dignified.",2
LORELAI,"No horseshoe carnation wreaths, got it. Good man, that dad of yours.",2
LUKE,"And since Louie's a w*r veteran, the town Revolutionary w*r reenactors will attend the service, do the salute thing, you know. I mean, it makes me nauseous, but my dad wanted it. Yeah, hi, I'm still here. . .Yes, the deceased is Louie Danes. . .Right. . .No, Hartford's not too far, I can do that. Thanks. Great, that's done. Uh, okay, I should probably go pick out a coffin before he gets here.",2
LORELAI,"Great, go.",2
LUKE,I have to close up.,2
LORELAI,"No, you don't. You're covered.",2
LUKE,You don't have to do this.,2
LORELAI,We don't mind. Go. It'll give me a chance to number all the tables.,2
LUKE,Be my guest.,2
LORELAI,"Also, are they arranged like this for any particular reason?",2
LUKE,Don't change anything.,2
LORELAI,It's totally not feng shui.,2
LUKE,Gertie.,2

CASSINI,"Excuse me, Taylor, where are your Brussels sprouts?",2
TAYLORory,,2
CASSINI,"Oh, I wanted to make them tonight.",2
TAYLORory,,2
CASSINI,"Okay, I'll just try across the street. Thank you.",2
TAYLORory,,2
CASSINI,It's a farmer's market. Isn't it wonderful? It just opened this morning and. . .I see sprouts!,2
TAYLORory,Who's the proprietor here?,2
PROPRIETORory,That would be me. What can I do for you?,2
TAYLORory,"Wait a minute, I know you. You're that long-haired freak that wanted to be town troubadour even though that weird brown-corduroy-jacket-wearing freak was already it.",2
PROPRIETORory,"That's right, good memo ry! How are ya?",2
TAYLORory,Let go of me!,2
PROPRIETORory,"Don't like to be touched, that's cool. Got a little David and Lisa thing happening? Made a mental note, no problem. Can I help you find something?",2
TAYLORory,I just want to know what inspired you to open a produce stand right across the street from my market.,2
PROPRIETORory,"Oh, is that your market?",2
TAYLORory,"Yes, that's my market.",2
PROPRIETORory,,2
PATTY,Excuse me? Your parsley   is it priced per bunch or per pound?,2
PROPRIETORory,,2
PATTY,"Mmm, good deal.",2
TAYLORory,,2
PATTY,"Oh, hi Taylor, how are you?",2
TAYLORory,,2
PATTY,"Oh, sure honey, whatever.",2
TAYLORory,There must be some mis take   this just isn't right.,2
PROPRIETORory,,2
CASSINI,Beautiful sprouts.,2
PROPRIETORory,,2
CASSINI,Thank you.,2
TAYLORory,I feel sick.,2
PROPRIETORory,"That'll be four dollars. See ya, Mr. Doose.",2
TAYLORory,,2
MICHELorelai,"Ah, Lorelai, good   tell me ab out the nine rooms set aside here. There's no name anywhere that I can see, and no credit card to hold them. Mistake?",2
LORELAI,"No, it's for Luke.",2
MICHELorelai,For who?,2
LORELAI,Luke from Luke's Diner.,2
MICHELorelai,Nine rooms for Luke from Luke's Diner?,2
LORELAI,That's right.,2
MICHELorelai,French fry convention?,2
LORELAI,"No, just personal.",2
MICHELorelai,Milkshake symposium?,2
LORELAI,"No Michel, it's something personal and I'm vouching for him.",2
MICHELorelai,Soda pop seminar?,2
LORELAI,Stop!,2
MICHELorelai,Pickle party?,2
LORELAI,"He's got nine rooms, now stifle.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, Mom, hi there.",2
EMILY,"Lorelai, hello.",2
LORELAI,"I'm sorry, did we get our signals crossed? I don't remember making an appointment with you.",2
EMILY,We have to make appointments to see each other?,2
LORELAI,"No, but   good one.",2
EMILY,I'm not here to see you.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, this isn't about the DAR meeting?",2
EMILY,"No, that's all ready to go. I'm here to meet with Sookie.",2
LORELAI,Sookie?,2
EMILY,,2
LORELAI,Oh my God.,2
SOOKIE,Aren't they beautiful?,2
LORELAI,Gorgeous. What are they for?,2
SOOKIE,My wedding.,2
LORELAI,Your wedding?,2
SOOKIE,"Emily, hi!",2
EMILY,"Well, is this everything I said it was?",2
SOOKIE,And more.,2
LORELAI,What do you mean they're for your wedding?,2
SOOKIE,"Oh, it's this company's sample place setting. Emily set me up with them. They did Celine Dion's wedding, and Steven Spielberg's daughter's Jack Russell Terrier's Bark Mitzvah.",2
LORELAI,You're putting me on.,2
SOOKIE,I couldn't make that up.,2
EMILY,"Excuse me, this one's slightly asymmetrical. Fix these.",2
LORELAI,"Hey, um, what is with the fancy place settings? I thought you were just gonna keep it simple.",2
SOOKIE,It is simple.,2
LORELAI,It lights up.,2
SOOKIE,"Just flip a switch, simple.",2
LORELAI,Tell me how my mother got so involved in all of this.,2
SOOKIE,"She's not that involved. She just mentioned the other day when she was here that she knew some people that could make some samples of stuff for us, like table settings and flower arrangements.",2
LORELAI,But we were gonna do the flowers ourselves.,2
SOOKIE,"I know, but what a hassle that would be.",2
LORELAI,It's to save money   flowers cost a fortune.,2
SOOKIE,"Yeah, but, the sampling of   what they're doing today   it's free. I'm not committed to any of this.",2
LORELAI,I hope not.,2
SOOKIE,"It's true   I say no, it all goes away. Not a penny is spent.",2
LORELAI,Okay.,2
SOOKIE,And it's fun.,2
LORELAI,"I don't wanna take away your fun, I just want you to be careful. See, you've entered Emilyland.",2
SOOKIE,Emilyland?,2
LORELAI,It's an upside down world where the Horchow House is considered low-rent and diamonds less than twenty-four carats are cr*cker Jack trinkets and Bentleys are for losers who can't afford a Rolls.,2
SOOKIE,"But I'm okay, really.",2
LORELAI,"All right. I have to help Luke with the lunch rush today, so I gotta go.",2
SOOKIE,"Go, we're fine.",2
LORELAI,Okay. Bye Mom.,2
EMILY,,2
TAYLORory,"Turnips, turnips, turnips. . .",2
RORY,What?,2
TAYLORory,Huh?,2
RORY,What about turnips?,2
TAYLORory,Why did you say turnips?,2
RORY,Because you said turnips.,2
TAYLORory,"No, I didn't.",2
RORY,I think you did.,2
TAYLORory,Nope.,2
RORY,Okay.,2
TAYLORory,"But I've got turnips   good ones, too. They're not as big as that crinite freak's turnips, but who needs bloated turnips? Mine are unassuming. I have nice, humble turnips.",2
RORY,Okie dokie. Taylor's wigging.,2
LORELAI,I know. He's been sitting there like the final days of d*ck Nixon for almost an hour.,2
RORY,Keep an eye on him.,2
LORELAI,"Hello there, how's it going?",2
CUSTOMERory,"Very good, young lady. You're still serving breakfast?",2
LORELAI,We serve it all day. What'll you have?,2
CUSTOMERory,Two eggs up on toast.,2
LORELAI,"Up, huh?",2
CUSTOMERory,Yup.,2
LORELAI,Wouldn't you rather have them scrambled?,2
CUSTOMERory,"Nope, up's how I like them.",2
LORELAI,"Come on, scrambled's better. Give it a shot. Say you want two scrambled eggs on toast, please?",2
CUSTOMERory,"Okay, young lady, two scrambled eggs on toast.",2
LORELAI,"Adam and Eve on a raft and wreck them! That's real live diner talk, see? The wreck them is the scrambled part.",2
CUSTOMERory,I deduced that.,2
TAYLORory,"I don't believe it, I don't believe it!",2
LORELAI,What's the matter?,2
TAYLORory,"That's Babette with an armload of rutabagas, and there's Miss Patty again   since when does she eat so much fruit?",2
LORELAI,Hey Kirk.,2
KIRK,Hello. Where's Luke?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, he's busy with some stuff so Rory and I are helping out. What can I get you?",2
KIRK,"I don't know. I want lunch, but I'm not sure what to get.",2
LORELAI,I have a suggestion. How about a hamburger with some strawberry ice cream with chocolate sauce for dessert?,2
KIRK,Sounds good.,2
LORELAI,"Yo, burn one, then pass me a p ink stick and throw some mud on it! God, I love this business.",2
PROPRIETORory,"Boy, it's freezing out there.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, it's quite a cold snap. How  bout a hot blonde with sand?",2
PROPRIETORory,"Coffee with cream and sugar would be great, thanks. Make sure its' foot's out the door.",2
LORELAI,"Put it in a cup to go, got it.",2
PROPRIETORory,"This icy weather hasn't kept customers away, though. They just keep coming. A lot of vegetable soup being eaten tonight, yesiree. Hope I don't put the good people at Campbell's out of business. Oh, hey Taylor. Didn't notice you there.",2
TAYLORory,Hello.,2
PROPRIETORory,"Taking a little break? I don't see how if you're anywhere near as busy as I am. Keep waiting for a lull, I never get one. I say to the people,  hey, I'll be back in a jif' and they're   look at them   they're lining up out there already.",2
TAYLORory,"Well, FYI, Van Halen hair, I'm plenty busy, but a good well-groomed businessman with properly prepared staff can take a break now and then.",2
KIRK,"It probably helped that your store was completely dead, too.",2
TAYLORory,It was not dead.,2
KIRK,"I thought it was closed when I walked by, but then I saw Gabby sitting at the cash register reading a tabloid.",2
TAYLORory,"Shut up, Kirk.",2
KIRK,Tapping on the counter with one of those little astrological scrolls.,2
TAYLORory,Enough.,2
LORELAI,Here you go.,2
PROPRIETORory,,2
LORELAI,"Luke, it's me.",2
LORELAI,Hey. I brought you a wimpy with a rose pinned on it.,2
LUKE,A what?,2
LORELAI,Turkey burger with onions.,2
LUKE,"Oh, thanks. Come on in.",2
LORELAI,How's the money pit coming?,2
LUKE,"Oh, just uh. . .that's it.",2
LORELAI,What's the matter?,2
LUKE,Nothing. None of them are coming   not a one.,2
LORELAI,Who?,2
LUKE,My relatives   the ones I booked all the rooms for   not one is coming to Louie's funeral.,2
LORELAI,You're kidding   why?,2
LUKE,"I don't know, which lame-o excuse do you wanna hear first? A bunch of them claimed they can't get outta work.",2
LORELAI,It's not so lame-o.,2
LUKE,Randy and Barbara don't wanna miss their brat kid's rugby semifinal.,2
LORELAI,Rugby has semifinals?,2
LUKE,"My sister never even called back. My cousins Paul and Jim, who my dad helped put through college, said they were too exhausted from a fishing trip. And slightly disturbed cousin Franny said she can't leave because her Petey's sick.",2
LORELAI,Son?,2
LUKE,Parrot.,2
LORELAI,Petey the parrot?,2
LUKE,"I saw the stupid thing once on a visit, flapping its wings like crazy, banging around, squawking the only two words it knows over and over   Petey and gorgeous. Gorgeous, Petey, gorgeous, Petey!",2
LORELAI,That's disturbing.,2
LUKE,My family's disturbing.,2
LORELAI,I'm so sorry.,2
LUKE,"This is wrong, this is not how it's done. A family member dies, you pay your respects   period.",2
LORELAI,"Look at it this way   if they don't wanna be there, you don't want them there.",2
LUKE,My dad wanted them to be there.,2
LORELAI,"I know. But hey, Louie lived in Stars Hollow most of his life, so a lot of people from here will be there, right?",2
LUKE,Right.,2
LORELAI,"I know it's upsetting, but maybe it's better this way.",2
LUKE,"Yeah, I guess. I really hate that bird.",2
RORY,Hey Mom?,2
LORELAI,"What's up, honey? You got a herd of bulls shopping for China?",2
LUKE,What?,2
LORELAI,Customers   how long have you owned a diner?,2
RORY,"Sorry. Jackson's outside, he wants to talk to you, he says it's important.",2
LORELAI,About what?,2
RORY,I don't know. He seems upset.,2
LORELAI,Ah. All right. You okay?,2
LUKE,"Yeah, thanks.",2
LORELAI,You might wanna study up on that diner talk.,2
LUKE,I'll do that tonight.,2
RORY,"Hey Luke, where's Jess?",2
LUKE,"I don't know, he's probably out playing basketball or something.",2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,"Oh, hey, uh, can I take your order?",2
CUSTOMERory,"Yes, uh, bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich, no mayo.",2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,Jackson?,2
JACKSON,I'm a miserable man.,2
LORELAI,What's up?,2
JACKSON,"Rememb er that sweet, simple, affordable little wedding Sookie and I agreed on with minimal disagreement   no disagreement, in fact   perhaps the first time in the history of wedding planning that a couple agreed one hundred percent on everything?",2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
JACKSON,"Gone. Ancient history. It's the Library of Alexandria, it's the Colossus of Roads, it's Pop Rocks, it's over, and do you know why?",2
LORELAI,My mother?,2
JACKSON,Look!,2
LORELAI,What are they doing?,2
JACKSON,They're measuring the town.,2
LORELAI,They're what?,2
JACKSON,They're measuring the entire town with tape measures.,2
LORELAI,Oh my God.,2
JACKSON,Your mother got hers at Neiman Marcus. It's platinum with gold leaf   it costs more than my car!,2
LORELAI,I am so sorry.,2
JACKSON,"Look, I love Sookie and I want her to have what she wants, but . . . you see what they're doing now?",2
LORELAI,Yeah.,2
JACKSON,"According to their diagrams, that's where the sixteen-piece orchestra goes.",2
LORELAI,How are they gonna fit a sixteen-piece orchestra in the gazebo?,2
JACKSON,"Oh, they wanna move the gazebo.",2
LORELAI,What?,2
JACKSON,A gazebo that's been there for a hundred years and they wanna move it. Who moves a gazebo? What kind of twisted mind even thinks about moving a gazebo?,2
LORELAI,"Okay, I'll take care of this.",2
JACKSON,She's so excited.,2
LORELAI,She's brainwashed. She's Patricia Hearst and my mother is the SLA.,2
JACKSON,I just hope it's not too late.,2
LORELAI,"I hope so, too.",2
JESS,Watch the shirt!,2
RORY,,2
PATTY,"Well, it seems the right thing to do, Taylor.",2
TAYLORory,"I concur. When one gazes at Stars Hollow, one can easily overlook a vital component of its beauty and that's the humble yet spunky twinkle light.",2
JESS,Holy cow.,2
LUKE,It doesn't get fruitier.,2
TAYLORory,"Harry's House of Twinkle Lights has been an integral part of this time for twenty years, so it's only right that we honor his retirement. So I hereby designate next Tuesday, Harry the Twinkle Light Man from Harry's House of Twinkle Lights Day.",2
JESS,"Well, that just trips off the tongue.",2
TAYLORory,"Late again, are we?",2
LORELAI,"Yes, I hope I'm not pregnant!",2
TAYLORory,What?,2
LORELAI,Are these seats taken?,2
LUKE,Don't drag me in to this.,2
TAYLORory,"You really have to work on your punctuality, Lorelai. I banged the meeting in a half an hour ago.",2
LORELAI,"Uh, dirty!",2
TAYLORory,I'm gonna take advantage of this unexpected pause in our proceedings to confer with Miss Patty about the next item on our agenda.,2
LORELAI,What'd we miss?,2
LUKE,Harry's retiring.,2
RORY,The twinkle light man?,2
LORELAI,What do we do for twinkle lights?,2
LUKE,Go to any discount store?,2
LORELAI,Blasphemy.,2
RORY,What are you doing here anyhow? This is a town meeting for people who participate in and care about the town.,2
JESS,"Well, Corky's Country Cavalcade on public access was pre-empted, so I thought I'd check out the next best thing.",2
LORELAI,I'm surprised you have time to be here.,2
LUKE,"I don't, but I haven't been able to get any of the w*r reenactors on the phone and I have to confirm them for Louie's funeral.",2
TAYLORory,"All right now, the last order of business is a matter relating personally to me, therefore I'm going to give Miss Patty my gavel.",2
LORELAI,"Again, dirty!",2
TAYLORory,,2
PATTY,"Oh, all right, gee. Now the chair recognizes Taylor Doose. Taylor, you have the floor.",2
TAYLORory,"Thank you, Patty. My issue, ladies and gentlemen, is in the form of a grievance against this hirsute hippie who opened a produce stand in the park.",2
BABETTE,"Oh yeah, k*ller veggies.",2
SY,,2
PATTY,The squash is beautiful.,2
BABETTE,Sexy   it's sexy squash.,2
TAYLORory,"Sexy or not, I demand that this man produce his permit post haste.",2
PROPRIETORory,Got it right here.,2
TAYLORory,"Mm hmm, just what I thought. This is not the proper permit for this kind of business. This is a type twenty-four B, otherwise known as a cart, kiosk, cart, kiosk permit. This is not valid for your business.",2
PROPRIETORory,Why'd you say it twice?,2
TAYLORory,Hmm?,2
BABETTE,"You said cart, kiosk, cart, kiosk.",2
LORELAI,It's repetitive.,2
RORY,And redundant.,2
LORELAI,It's repetitive.,2
RORY,And redundant.,2
LORELAI,"We certainly are entertaining, Mac.",2
RORY,"Indubitably, Tosh.",2
TAYLORory,"It's not redundant. It's three separate things. It's a cart, a kiosk, and a mechanical hybrid referred to as a cart-slash-kiosk, hence cart, kiosk, cart/kiosk.",2
BABETTE,He did it again.,2
KIRK,He's been stressed lately. His store is deserted.,2
TAYLORory,"I'll make it simple. This is for businesses that roll in in the morning and roll out at night. Emphasis on the word roll   rolling businesses, businesses that roll.",2
PROPRIETORory,But I carry my tables out at night.,2
TAYLORory,,2
PATTY,Transcript?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, Taylor, this isn't Charlie Rose.",2
BABETTE,He's losing his marbles.,2
ANDREW,It's just a personal vendetta.,2
KIRK,,2
PATTY,"I think that we should end the meeting right here, Taylor.",2
TAYLORory,"Wait a second, wait a second! You there, when Lady Godiva here wanted to be town troubadour over you, I stood by your side. Why aren't you backing me now?",2
TROUBADOURory," Cause you left me twistin' for a long time before you did, Taylor, and it didn't feel good. I even wrote a song about the experience.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, I heard it. It's called ""Taylor Left Me Twistin'.""",2
RORY,"Oh yeah, it's really good.",2
TROUBADOURory,"You think? Because I'm having a little trouble with the chorus. Taylor left me twistin', he set my eyes a mistin'. I'm just not sure if it has that thing, though, you know?",2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,I'm gonna wrap this up.,2
TAYLORory,,2
PATTY,"All right, everybody who agrees that we would not feel good about that, say aye.",2
ALLorelai,,2
PATTY,"Meeting adjourned, goodnight.",2
LORELAI,Another fun one!,2
LUKE,"Taylor, hold on a sec!",2
RORY,,2
LUKE,"Guys, hold it, come on, you heard me calling you, stop!",2
TAYLORory,"What is it, Luke?",2
LUKE,"What do you mean, what is it? My Uncle Louie's funeral is tomorrow afternoon and I haven't heard from any of you. The man was a World w*r II veteran, that's what you reenactor freaks do   you go to vet's funerals, so you're gonna be there, right? Hello?",2
TAYLORory,"You said you were gonna talk to him, Sy.",2
SY,Bert said he was gonna do it.,2
BERT,It's Taylor's job.,2
SY,You always pass the buck.,2
LUKE,"Talk to me ab out what, guys?",2
TAYLORory,"You might as well know, Luke. We don't wanna go to Louie's funeral.",2
LUKE,What?,2
ANDREW,We all hated Louie.,2
LUKE,"Oh, come on, that's not true.",2
TAYLORory,"He always had a scowl on his face, not a kind word for anybody. He would light those hideous cigars, blow smoke in people's faces and then spit after each puff.",2
SY,He was disgusting.,2
ANDREW,And mean.,2
KIRK,He kicked my dog when I was a kid.,2
SY,He hit on my wife repeatedly.,2
KIRK,Toto was always different after that.,2
SY,My wife was much affected as well.,2
KIRK,I'd toss her something to fetch and she'd start to run after it and halfway there she'd forget what she was doing.,2
SY,She never enjoyed her soap operas the same after that.,2
KIRK,She'd just lie down and go to sleep.,2
LUKE,This is an exaggeration.,2
BERT,We're not exaggerating. We threw a big party when he left town!,2
SY,I made love to my life that night like I never have.,2
KIRK,"My Toto barked a happy bark, then quietly stopped breathing. She was old.",2
LUKE,I don't believe this.,2
ANDREW,"Come on, Luke. You knew the guy.",2
LUKE,"This man was my uncle, okay, and a w*r veteran. He deserves a veteran's funeral, but hey, if you guys are too lazy to show up, then. . .",2
TAYLORory,"He's the lazy one. Never once did he participate in a town function. In fact, when we reenactors gathered, he'd throw things at us.",2
SY,"And not soft things, hard things.",2
BERT,"Rocks, and small tools.",2
LUKE,"Okay, I've heard enough.",2
SY,"And he got meaner as he got older. Never married, never had kids.",2
BERT,A real loner.,2
LUKE,"To hell with you guys, who needs you! I might just throw rocks and small tools at you myself next time I see ya!",2
TAYLORory,"A defensive hothead, just like Louie!",2
BERT,,2
SOOKIE,"Oh my God, this is so hi-tech.",2
LORELAI,Hey. What's going on?,2
SOOKIE,I'm downloading wedding stuff from Prague.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, you're kidding.",2
SOOKIE,"It's streaming in right now. That's Internet talk   streaming. Did you know that? And did you know it's not called Czechoslovakia anymore? It's just Czech Republic. Slovakia is its own separate thing. It's weird, isn't it? It's like if we just suddenly started saying there's no more Connecticut, it's just Connec. . . Ticut.",2
LORELAI,"Sookie, what are you downloading from Prague?",2
MICHELorelai,"Oh, this will much amuse you.",2
SOOKIE,Color samples for the big ceramic stands.,2
LORELAI,Big ceramic stands for what?,2
SOOKIE,For the giant papier-mâché mushrooms.,2
LORELAI,What are the papier-mâché mushrooms for?,2
SOOKIE,"For the midgets dressed like angels to dance under, silly.",2
LORELAI,Oh my God.,2
SOOKIE,Emily found the best papier-mâché mushroom maker in Paris. He's much better than the guy that makes them in Belgium   what a hack.,2
LORELAI,"Sookie, honey, I need you stop staring and streaming for one second. We need to talk.",2
MICHELorelai,"Please, please do not talk her out of these things. I do not want to die without seeing midgets dancing with a mushroom.",2
LORELAI,Stay out of this.,2
MICHELorelai,"Oh, you're no fun.",2
SOOKIE,What is it honey?,2
LORELAI,"The danger of Emilyworld is that you don't always know you're in it, when actually you are.",2
SOOKIE,"Aw, not this Emilyworld stuff again",2
LORELAI,"Sookie, have you run the numbers on any of this? What is this costing you?",2
SOOKIE,I don't know the full cost but your mother is getting me fifty percent off everything. She is so connected.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, but fifty percent off a load of money is still half a load of money. You don't have half a load to spend.",2
SOOKIE,"Well, if I scrimp I can afford a quarter load.",2
LORELAI,That's still too much.,2
SOOKIE,"Well, your mother said she'd chip in a little.",2
LORELAI,"Sookie, that is way, way, way inappropriate.",2
SOOKIE,I didn't take her up on it but it was nice.,2
LORELAI,"Sookie, this isn't you, the midgets and the mushrooms and God knows what else. And it isn't Jackson either.",2
SOOKIE,What do you mean?,2
LORELAI,We talked.,2
SOOKIE,You and Jackson talked?,2
LORELAI,"I'm sorry but he came to me al l upset, and I love you Sookie and I love him too and it just seemed like it was time for me to meddle.",2
SOOKIE,He was upset?,2
LORELAI,He was pretty upset.,2
SOOKIE,Why didn't he just talk to me?,2
LORELAI,"Because he's Jackson, he wants you to be happy and to give you everything you want. So what it comes down to is   is this what you want?",2
SOOKIE,"Well, maybe the midgets are a little over the top. And the mushrooms. . . oh my God, it's all sounding so silly now.",2
LORELAI,"You're coming out of it, keep going.",2
SOOKIE,"No, no, it's not what I want! We were supposed to keep this nice and simple. God, we had it all worked out.",2
LORELAI,So go back.,2
SOOKIE,"I will go back. That is, if Jackson still wants to marry me.",2
LORELAI,Of course he still wants to marry you.,2
SOOKIE,I'm gonna call him and I'm gonna tell him it's all changing back.,2
LORELAI,Good.,2
SOOKIE,"Ooh, I should call and cancel some stuff first. I've gotta call Belgium and Oslo and, uh, oh, Copenhagen, Bora Bora.",2
LORELAI,What did you order from there?,2
SOOKIE,I'm gonna shield you from that one.,2
LORELAI,"Thanks. Hello?. . .Luke!. . . Slow down, slow down. . . Okay, I'll come right over. I gotta go. Call, call, and welcome back, friend.",2
SOOKIE,,2
LORELAI,There you are. What   .,2
LUKE,It won't close.,2
LORELAI,What?,2
LUKE,The lid.,2
LORELAI,"To what? Oh, hello. . . Louie.",2
LUKE,That's Louie.,2
LORELAI,"Nice tan. So, now, you say the lid won't close?",2
LUKE,"Yes, the lid won't close.",2
LORELAI,Did you buy the right size?,2
LUKE,Of course I bought the right size. FUNERAL,2
DIRECTORory,It's the model we recommend for those of medium height and weight.,2
LUKE,And he's of medium height and weight.,2
LORELAI,So then why won't it close?,2
LUKE,Because of the stuff.,2
LORELAI,What stuff?,2
LUKE,The stuff. He left a list of stuff he wanted buried with him. FUNERAL,2
DIRECTORory,It's not uncommon.,2
LUKE,"It's a very long list. His fishing reel, bowling trophy, a flask, his antique dueling pistols, his copy of Sherman's Memoirs.",2
LORELAI,So is all the stuff in there now?,2
LUKE,"Yes, it is. I shoved it in the best I could but now it won't close which defeats the entire purpose of having a damn casket in the first place.",2
LORELAI,May I?,2
LUKE,Give it a shot.,2
LORELAI,Whoa!,2
LUKE,The football signed by Johnny Unitas gives it that bounce.,2
LORELAI,What if we moved the gas mask and the pith helmet down towards the feet?,2
LUKE,"That end already has every baseball card he ever bought, thousands of them.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, bungee cord! No. Um, what if we got some people from the office here, you know, accounting or whatever, to sit on the lid and then we could latch it? Do you have anybody you could spring. . .hm. I'm out of ideas.",2
LUKE,"So am I. You know what, to hell with this. To hell with this!",2
LORELAI,"Luke, now come on.",2
LUKE,I can't deal with this anymore!,2
LORELAI,"Well, it has to be dealt with.",2
LUKE,"No, it doesn't. It's not as if he deserves my help or my respect.",2
LORELAI,The man was your uncle.,2
LUKE,He was a jerk!,2
LORELAI,Don't say that.,2
LUKE,"No, no, Taylor and the guys were right. I was cutting Louie slack out of respect for my dad, but the man was rotten and mean and selfish all his life. For God's sake, he's even selfish in death. Other people would've loved to have had those baseball cards. I would've loved to have those baseball cards. He's got Lou Gehrig's rookie card, Joe DiMaggio, Willie Mays, tons of others   but no! My uncle, King Tut, has to take all of them to the afterlife with him! FUNERAL",2
DIRECTORory,"Sir, your voice.",2
LUKE,"I'm done, I've had it. From now on, it's just the bare minimum and that's it. Dig a big hole and just dump the casket in unlatched. If stuff falls out, fine. Just pile on enough dirt and make sure nothing's showing!",2
LORELAI,I'm assuming that wouldn't be appropriate either? FUNERAL,2
DIRECTORory,No.,2
LORELAI,,2
CUSTOMERory,"Young man, where's the young lady we've heard so much about who's using those delightful old diner phrases to place people's orders? It sounds so fun. Could you point her out for us?",2
JESS,No. That's everyone. I'll be upstairs.,2
RORY,Thanks for doing the very least you could possibly do.,2
JESS,You're welcome.,2
LORELAI,"Luke, there you are. I was worried.",2
LUKE,"Yeah, sorry, I should've called. Thanks for covering again. This'll be the last time, I promise.",2
LORELAI,It's okay. Where were you?,2
LUKE,"Well, at first, I walked around a bunch, ya know, just trying to clear my head. Saw a lot of Hartford   and what a cesspool.",2
LORELAI,"Well, you're not a city man.",2
LUKE,Then I calmed down after awhile and I figured dumping Louie's body in an open grave with all his stuff probably would be a little cold.,2
LORELAI,Just a tad.,2
LUKE,So I got a Yellow Pages and I found the Big and Tall Casket Shop in Hartford.,2
LORELAI,You're kidding.,2
LUKE,"Nope, I found a casket that would fit my hundred and sixty pound uncle and his hundred and forty pounds of stuff, got the lid to shut the first time we tried it, so the funeral's on as scheduled.",2
LORELAI,Good.,2
LUKE,I still don't know why I'm doing this.,2
LORELAI,You're doing it for your dad.,2
LUKE,"Yeah, I guess. Although he's dead so he'd never know if I was doing it any different.",2
LORELAI,He knows. He's got the big Luke picture screen on twenty four hours a day and he watches and smiles. And you're doing it  cause you're you.,2
LUKE,"Hey, I'm gonna change real fast and you can retire from your diner career forever.",2
LORELAI,"Oh no, it's fun. I came up with some new diner phrases. Do you know what a Lucky Duck Cluck is?",2
LUKE,Not offhand.,2
LORELAI,It's foie gras with chicken and green shamrock frosting.,2
LUKE,Why would anyone ever order that?,2
LORELAI,"If they're high. Ugh, good grief.",2
LUKE,What?,2
LORELAI,"Bad vibe sandwich just came in , better retreat.",2
LUKE,I won't be long.,2
LORELAI,Hi Mom.,2
EMILY,Since when do you work here?,2
LORELAI,I'm just lending a hand. What's going on?,2
EMILY,I went by the inn to work with Sookie on her wedding.,2
LORELAI,Yeah?,2
EMILY,And she fired me.,2
LORELAI,I'm sure she didn't fire you.,2
EMILY,She claims to have changed her mind on all the things we had planned.,2
LORELAI,"Well, maybe she did.",2
EMILY,"No, she didn't. I know what's behind this. That is, who's behind this.",2
LORELAI,"Mom, it was getting to be too much for her and too much for her fiancé.",2
EMILY,I knew it.,2
LORELAI,"Mom, these are not wealthy people, do you understand that? They're saving for a home and your midgets were dancing between them and their dreams.",2
EMILY,You say midgets like it's so absurd.,2
LORELAI,Do you hear yourself?,2
EMILY,I don't see what was so wrong with my just helping Sookie plan her wedding.,2
LORELAI,"Mom, come on.",2
EMILY,"What, come on?",2
LORELAI,You weren't planning Sookie's wedding.,2
EMILY,"Well, then, whose wedding was I planning?",2
LORELAI,Mine.,2
EMILY,Don't be ridiculous.,2
LORELAI,"Mom, your vision for this wedding and all the over the top stuff and the gazillion dollar flowers and bunting and champagne fountain and the Haute Couture dress   who's wearing that wedding dress in your mind's eye, Mom? Is it Sookie or is it me?",2
EMILY,"I wasn't planning your wedding, Lorelai.",2
LORELAI,Right.,2
EMILY,"The wedding I was planning was for Sookie. The mushrooms and colors, they all seemed like fun. A little crazy, just like she is. It definitely was not for you.",2
LORELAI,Okay Mom.,2
EMILY,"I know that in a million years, you would never let me plan your wedding. I gave up on that dream a long time ag o. Yours was going to be a Russian winter theme   the Romanovs.",2
LORELAI,"Before the firing squad, I assume?",2
EMILY,"Snow white roses, trees with white lights and candles, snow everywhere, you arriving in a silver sleigh with white horses.",2
LORELAI,Wow.,2
EMILY,You hate the idea.,2
LORELAI,"No, no, I just   .",2
EMILY,You just hate it.,2
LORELAI,"No, it just doesn't seem like me.",2
EMILY,"Yes, well, it would've been beautiful.",2
LORELAI,I'm sure it would've been.,2
EMILY,"Anyhow, it's obvious that wouldn't even be appropriate anymore being as I'm probably standing in your reception hall.",2
LORELAI,Excuse me?,2
EMILY,Burgers and fries for the dinner? The bride walks down the aisle with a ketchup dispenser in her hand.,2
LORELAI,Please tell me w hat you're talking about.,2
EMILY,I'm talking about Luke.,2
LORELAI,Luke? Mom!,2
EMILY,"Well, it's obvious, Lorelai.",2
LORELAI,"No, it's not, Mom.",2
EMILY,You're with him constantly.,2
LORELAI,He feeds me.,2
EMILY,You bring up his name constantly.,2
LORELAI,"Once again, he feeds me.",2
EMILY,"The moment he calls, you run to his side.",2
LORELAI,"He's my friend, he needed me, I had to be there.",2
EMILY,"Yes, I know you did.",2
LUKE,Hi.,2
EMILY,"Hello. I have to go. I'll see you for dinner tonight, Lorelai. And Luke, I'm sure I'll see you again soon. What do you think of the Romanovs?",2
LUKE,They probably had it coming.,2
EMILY,,2
REVEREND,"We're here, of course, to honor Louie, to pay our respects and to bid him a sorrowful goodbye.",2
LORELAI,Are you okay?,2
LUKE,Yeah. I'm not big on funerals in general.,2
LORELAI,Nobody is.,2
REVEREND,"He passed away in his sleep, so the end came peacefully for Louie, which I'm sure is a great comfort to all who knew him.",2
LUKE,The passing away part was a great comfort for all who knew him.,2
REVEREND,I didn't know him.,2
LUKE,Good thing.,2
REVEREND,"But I understand he was a fine man, destined to be missed by many.",2
LUKE,Especially ones that were suing him.,2
LORELAI,Stop. Sorry father.,2
REVEREND,Reverend.,2
LORELAI,Right.,2
REVEREND,Now let us witness Louie Danes as he is interred and brought to the Lord.,2
LORELAI,"It was a nice service. Nice and, um, intimate.",2
LUKE,I guess everybody deserves something at the end. Thanks for coming.,2
LORELAI,I wouldn't have missed it.,2
LUKE,"That ain't me, is it?",2
LORELAI,What are you talking about?,2
LUKE,"What Taylor said about me being like Louie, a loner, never being married and stuff. I mean, I am getting crankier as I get older, he's not so far off.",2
LORELAI,"You are not your uncle. I mean, would Louie ever build someone a chuppah, or help fix things around someone's house without being asked, or make a special coffee cake with balloons for a girl's sixteenth birthday?",2
LUKE,Rory told you about that?,2
LORELAI,Yes. And would Louie have taken in his sister's kid without hesitating and without asking for anything in return?,2
LUKE,No one would've trusted Louie with their kid. He probably would've forgotten to feed him or something.,2
LORELAI,You get my point?,2
LUKE,"Yeah, I get it. What's that? Is that Andrew?",2
LORELAI,I believe it is.,2
LUKE,That's all of them.,2
LUKE,Thanks.,2
LORELAI,It's what your dad wanted.,2
LUKE,"Yeah. Oh, I know Louie would've hated this.",2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,Do you think he's in heaven?,2
LUKE,"I hope so, just so my dad can kick his butt around the place.",2
LORELAI,Can you kick when you're in heaven?,2
LUKE,It's probably frowned upon.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, plus you're all see-through and gauzy and your dad's foot could go right through him.",2
LUKE,This is a silly conversation. What's all this?,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,Hi.,2
LUKE,What's going on?,2
RORY,It's kind of like a wake.,2
LUKE,A wake?,2
LORELAI,For Louie?,2
RORY,I thought you set it up,2
LORELAI,I didn't set it up.,2
RORY,"Well, it's going well, anyway. People brought a ton of food if you're hungry.",2
LORELAI,Huh.,2
LUKE,This is unexpected.,2
LORELAI,Very.,2
LUKE,Don't you have wakes for people you like?,2
LORELAI,I think it might be for you.,2
LUKE,Am I dead?,2
LORELAI,"Face it, Luke, people like you.",2
LUKE,Shut up.,2
LORELAI,"And with charm like that, how can they resist?",2
PROPRIETORory,"Hey Taylor, cool threads. Very ""One if By Land.""",2
TAYLORory,Mm hmm.,2
PROPRIETORory,I see you're digging into the vegetables.,2
TAYLORory,Thanks for the play by play.,2
PROPRIETORory,"Brought those myself. Hey, how was the funeral?",2
TAYLORory,"Shouldn't you be tending to your little stand out there, friend?",2
PROPRIETORory,"Oh, the stand's gone.",2
TAYLORory,What?,2
PROPRIETORory,"It's gone, I'm all packed up, I'm outta here.",2
TAYLORory,I don't get it.,2
PROPRIETORory,"I just grow all that stuff in my back yard and as of yesterday, sold it all.",2
TAYLORory,You sold it all?,2
PROPRIETORory,"Sold it all, made enough money to do some traveling. Have you ever been to Israel? Turbulent, I know, but I thought I'd go down and try to plant some peace down there, know what I mean? See if it grows and see if it spreads.",2
TAYLORory,Shut up. Why did you put me through all that hoohah at the town meeting if your vegetable business was just temporary?,2
PROPRIETORory,"Actually, you put yourself through it, Taylor. You put yourself through it.",2
RORY,Nice spread.,2
JESS,People have too much free time in this town.,2
RORY,You did a good thing.,2
JESS,What do you mean?,2
RORY,I thought my mom set this up. Turns out she didn't.,2
JESS,So? Wasn't me.,2
RORY,It wasn't?,2
JESS,"Nah, no way. It wasn't me.",2
RORY,If you say so.,2
JESS,"Look, the crazy ballet teacher called and asked when Luke was getting back from the funeral, if I could unlock the door. I came down, I unlocked the door, then went back upstairs and back to sleep.",2
RORY,So you did do a little something.,2
JESS,I unlocked the door.,2
RORY,So that people could come in here and put this together. Nice.,2
JESS,"Nice for them, not for me.",2
RORY,"You facilitated it, you made it happen, so I guess that means that you're officially apart of our town now.",2
JESS,"Hey, wait a minute.",2
RORY,Welcome.,2
JESS,,2
RORY,"See you for some tree planting over at the Arbor Day Festival, buddy.",2
JESS,"Yeah, well maybe I can knock over a liquor store while everyone else is planting those stupid trees.",2
RORY,"As long as it's a liquor store in town, neighbor.",2
SY,"So, like I say, it's Halloween, right, and we're lucky Louie doesn't have razor wire around his yard, you know how he is. So finally one of the neighborhood kids, he gets all courageous and he goes sauntering up to the door and he goes  trick or treat!' Louie finally throws the door open, looks at him and says,  Did you get a Reese's cup tonight?' And the kid looks in his bag and he says,  Yes sir, I did.' So Louie grabs it, says  thank you very much!,' then slams the door in his face.",2
LORELAI,I'm sorry I never met him.,2
LUKE,He was colorful.,2
KIRK,,2
PATTY,"So one day I'm at the post office, I'm in line when Louie just about knocks me over and he cuts in line. I said,  Louie, there's a line!' So he says,  Kiss my butt!' and I said,  You mind your manners!' and he says,  Please kiss my butt!' and drops his pants!",2

LORELAI,Mom.,2
EMILY,No.,2
LORELAI,We're starving.,2
EMILY,We're waiting for your father.,2
LORELAI,It's gonna get cold.,2
EMILY,We are waiting for your father.,2
LORELAI,We've been waiting forever.,2
EMILY,We have not been waiting forever.,2
LORELAI,"Forever. Godot was just here. He said  I ain't waiting for Richard,' grabbed a roll, and left. It's been forever.",2
EMILY,"When we gather as a family, we eat as a family. We don't eat in shifts   you know that and Richard certainly knows that.",2
RORY,When did he get that antique car anyhow?,2
EMILY,A couple of horrible weeks ago.,2
LORELAI,What happened to the oil painting hobby of his?,2
EMILY,"Ah, you know your father. When he couldn't foresee rivaling Cezanne, he lost interest so he bought that car. Lorelai!",2
LORELAI,"Mom, it's not dinner, it's just my private stash.",2
EMILY,It's eating and we're not eating.,2
Posted,05/05/02 11:20,2
LORELAI,"You know, you're bound by the rules of the Geneva Convention, Mother, just like everyone else. Hey, no one told me it was casual Friday.",2
RICHARD,Hello everyone. You haven't started?,2
EMILY,"Of course we haven't started, we were waiting for you. I thought you were almost done.",2
RICHARD,"Well, I was but this car has a mind of its own. As I turned to leave it began spraying some sort of green solution at me.",2
RORY,Yuck.,2
RICHARD,"Yuck, indeed. Well, go on, start.",2
LORELAI,Ooh!,2
RICHARD,No sense in waiting for me.,2
LORELAI,Coolness!,2
EMILY,Stop!,2
LORELAI,Gomer said!,2
EMILY,"We are waiting for you, Richard. In thirty five years, I have never ever started a dinner without you unless you were out of town or seriously ill. Elsa, take everything away and keep it warm! Now please go upstairs and get ready so we can all enjoy a nice family dinner. . .together.",2
RICHARD,I'll be right back.,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,Hey there. Anywhere?,2
LUKE,Anywhere you want.,2
LORELAI,Could you move please?,2
CUSTOMERory,What?,2
LUKE,Anywhere where there's not people.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, well, like I'm a mind reader. I was just joking. Hmm, that's funny.",2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,"Something's different here, something's changed.",2
RORY,Impossible.,2
LORELAI,"No, I swear, there's something.",2
RORY,"You know, I'd be very disappointed if something changed in here.",2
LORELAI,Why are you so anti-change?,2
RORY,Because most change sucks.,2
LORELAI,"That's true, it does. Uh! The chalkboard!",2
RORY,What about it?,2
LORELAI,Luke's special omelet. That is brand new.,2
RORY,A new special? His four-slice French toast has been up there since I was born!,2
LORELAI,"You just gotta let that go, baby.",2
LUKE,What can I get you?,2
LORELAI,You have a new special.,2
LUKE,I sure do.,2
LORELAI,Nice. What is the special omelet?,2
LUKE,You won't like it.,2
LORELAI,How do you know?,2
LUKE,"Because you've been eating here for years and I know what you like, and you won't like it.",2
LORELAI,Can I at least hear what it is?,2
LUKE,Fine. It's three eggs with bits of bacon.,2
LORELAI,I like bacon.,2
LUKE,Cubed tomatoes.,2
LORELAI,Sounds good.,2
LUKE,Swiss cheese and a dash of oregano.,2
LORELAI,"A dash, he says.",2
LUKE,I've got other customers here.,2
LORELAI,I'm gonna go with the special omelet.,2
LUKE,Okay.,2
LORELAI,With a side of bacon.,2
LUKE,There's bacon in the omelet.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, then skip the bacon.",2
LUKE,The side of bacon?,2
LORELAI,The bacon in the omelet.,2
LUKE,Hold the bacon.,2
LORELAI,Can I get Jack cheese?,2
LUKE,On the side?,2
LORELAI,"Instead of Swiss, Swiss is so stringy.",2
LUKE,"Fine, Jack cheese.",2
LORELAI,"Also, I think I'm allergic to oregano so hold that, too, and some coffee.",2
LUKE,"So, just the eggs, tomatoes, and Jack cheese.",2
LORELAI,Not too many tomatoes.,2
LUKE,Light on the tomatoes.,2
LORELAI,"Very light, just a teeny-tiny amount, practically none.",2
LUKE,I'm skipping the tomatoes. It's an omelet with Jack cheese.,2
LORELAI,Perfect.,2
LUKE,You did this on purpose.,2
LORELAI,Did what?,2
RORY,French toast for me. That was cruel.,2
LORELAI,"I know. Look how hard he worked on that sign and everything. Look at the handwriting, it's so precise, so determined. It's focused-Luke.",2
RORY,That's Jess' handwriting.,2
LORELAI,Really? How do you know Jess' writing?,2
RORY,"Oh, well, I lent him a book and he wrote some stuff in it.",2
LORELAI,He vandalized one of your books?,2
RORY,"No, he didn't vandalize it. He wrote in the margins, thoughts and stuff.",2
LORELAI,"Like what, like play basketball, eat a sandwich   stuff like that?",2
RORY,"No, stuff, like margin stuff. People like Mark Twain wrote in margins.",2
LORELAI,"Pilot a steamboat, write Huckleberry Finn?",2
RORY,Forget it.,2
LORELAI,"No, no, I'm sure margin writing is very common. Oh, hey, you didn't tell me Dean was joining us.",2
RORY,Dean?,2
LORELAI,Hey.,2
DEAN,Hi.,2
RORY,What are you doing here?,2
DEAN,I just dropped by to say hello.,2
RORY,How'd you know we were here?,2
DEAN, Cause you're always here.,2
RORY,We're not always here.,2
LORELAI,"Uh, do you wanna eat with us, Dean?",2
DEAN,Rory?,2
RORY,Huh?,2
DEAN,Is that okay?,2
RORY,"Yes. Oh, yes, you don't have to ask.",2
LORELAI,"Hey, we're three.",2
LUKE,I did the math. You gonna eat something?,2
DEAN,"Sure, yeah, I'll take the special omelet, I guess.",2
LUKE,You put him up to this?,2
LORELAI,"No, I did not!",2
LUKE,Sure. You don't even know what's in it.,2
DEAN,I'm not picky.,2
LUKE,So you'll send it back after I make it?,2
DEAN,No.,2
LUKE,Right. I'll come back when I've got time for this.,2
DEAN,What was that all about?,2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,So is everything in the materials clear to everyone?,2
CHIP,Pretty much.,2
LOUISE,"Oh, were we reading these now?",2
RORY,"Yeah, that's why we've all been kind of quiet for the past ten minutes.",2
LOUISE,"I thought it was, like, prayer time or something.",2
PARIS,Good grief.,2
MADELINE,I'm still reading mine.,2
PARIS,What?,2
MADELINE,I read slow so I don't miss anything.,2
PARIS,"It's not the Bhagavad Gita, Madeline. It's simple instructions for the business fair.",2
LOUISE,Someone's not taking to Elba too kindly.,2
PARIS,What does that mean?,2
LOUISE,"Just that Rory's the leader of this group, Napoleon, and you're not.",2
PARIS,"Excuse me, leader? You wanna lead here, you've got anarchy.",2
RORY,I'm just enjoying the show.,2
BRAD,"Hi, I think this is my group.",2
RORY,"Brad, hey.",2
BRAD,"Oh, you rememb er me.",2
RORY,Of course I do.,2
BRAD,Cool.,2
RORY,So you're back at Chilton now?,2
BRAD,"Oh, yeah. My psychiatrist convinced my parents that I should face my fears instead of running away from them and my rabbi agreed, so here I am.",2
RORY,"Well, nice to have you back. Take a seat.",2
BRAD,"Paris. Her name is Paris, right?",2
RORY,"Brad, let me catch you up here. There's going to be an intra-school business fair in three weeks. Each group has to come up with a consumer product that's geared toward high school kids.",2
BRAD,Neat.,2
RORY,"So we pick our product and we make a prototype of it, then we use our imaginary million dollar budget to mass produce, market, and distribute it, and we'll present all of this at the fair.",2
BRAD,Cool.,2
PARIS,"Hey Brad? Your festive interjections are a real kick in the pants, but we're low on time, so can it.",2
RORY,That's it. In two days we're going to reconvene and pitch product ideas.,2
LOUISE,Class dismissed?,2
PARIS,"Whoa whoa whoa, we haven't even discussed business advisors.",2
RORY,Right. We're supposed to get a parent who's in business to advise us. Anyone score?,2
CHIP,My dad's got scheduling conflicts up the wazoo.,2
RORY,No for Chip.,2
PARIS,My dad's in Hong Kong for the month but he can video-conference in if need be.,2
RORY,No for Paris.,2
MADELINE,My dad's traveling.,2
LOUISE,My dad's in court for the next six weeks.,2
RORY,Lawyer?,2
LOUISE,Defendant.,2
RORY,We won't pry.,2
LOUISE,I have no idea what he's up on anyway.,2
RORY,And no one's mom works?,2
MADELINE,Working moms are so nineties.,2
BRAD,My mom works. She's a curator at the Hartford Natural Museum.,2
PARIS,"We need experienced business advisors, Brad   not someone who poses animal carcasses.",2
MADELINE,What about your mom?,2
RORY,My mom?,2
PARIS,"Yeah, that's right. She runs a hotel.",2
RORY,"It's just an inn, a small inn.",2
MADELINE,It's still a business.,2
CHIP,"She must keep books and stuff, right?",2
RORY,"Yeah, but they're really small books.",2
PARIS,"Look, it's not perfect but it's a better option than Brad's mom, the buffalo stuffer.",2
BRAD,She doesn't stuff the animals. That's taxidermy.,2
PARIS,"Who is this rabbi that encouraged you to come back here? Give me his address, I'm gonna go over there and pop him one.",2
RORY,"Okay, hold it. Now, I don't think my mom is right for this.",2
PARIS,"Well, she's all we've got so you need to do whatever it takes to make it happen, otherwise maybe you shouldn't be the group leader.",2
LOUISE,"A coup d'état, how exciting.",2
RORY,There's no coup d'état. I'll ask her.,2
PARIS,,2
SOOKIE,"Thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two. . .",2
LORELAI,"Sookie, look!",2
SOOKIE,"Thirty-three, thirty-four, thirty-five, can't look, I'm making meringue, thirty-seven, fine science.",2
LORELAI,You got a package!,2
SOOKIE,"Thirty-nine, gotta count, forty, can't over-whip.",2
LORELAI,I think it's your wedding invitations!,2
SOOKIE,"Whoooooo! Gimme it ! Ohh, I wanna see them! Oh, you're gonna love these. They're pearly white with this beautiful lavender stripe - . . .",2
LORELAI,Aw.,2
SOOKIE,I'm gonna choke somebody by the neck until brains ooze out of their ears.,2
LORELAI,"What, they're beautiful.",2
SOOKIE,"The name, look at the name.",2
LORELAI,The marriage of his daughter. . .,2
BOTH,Susie St. James.,2
SOOKIE,Who is Susie St. James?,2
LORELAI,I think it's you.,2
SOOKIE,What am I gonna do?,2
LORELAI,It can be changed.,2
SOOKIE,"No, and these have to go out in a week.",2
LORELAI,We're calling right now.,2
SOOKIE,I am so not a Susie.,2
MICHELorelai,"Good morning, beautiful morning.",2
SOOKIE,It sucks from where I'm sitting.,2
MICHELorelai,"Heartbreak. Lorelai, do you remember I have tomorrow afternoon off?",2
LORELAI,"I rememb er, big plans?",2
MICHELorelai,"Yes, my mother is coming to visit.",2
LORELAI,"Hello, yes, customer service please, thanks. Sorry.",2
MICHELorelai,About what?,2
LORELAI,You said your mother's coming for a visit.,2
MICHELorelai,"But I'm excited, I never get to see her.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, I must be projecting. Your mother's coming for a visit!",2
MICHELorelai,She's coming down for three days.,2
LORELAI,Is she staying here?,2
MICHELorelai,"No. She stays with me, of course.",2
LORELAI,In your tiny place?,2
MICHELorelai,"Oh, she's fine with it. I mean, we stay up all night gabbing and watching movies. We have a ball.",2
LORELAI,"Wow, I can't wait to meet her. Oh, hello. Yes, we have a problem with some wedding invitations we ordered. Okay. They're transferring me.",2
SOOKIE,I heard that.,2
LORELAI,He's really happy about his mother coming to visit.,2
SOOKIE,"I heard that, too.",2
LORELAI,"Totally foreign to me. Hi. Oh great, I'm gonna pass you over to my friend who has a problem with some mer chandise she ordered. Hold on one sec. Listen to me, I've had a lot of experience dealing with people who have screwed something up. You have a better chance of getting them to help you if you don't get all hysterical.",2
SOOKIE,Okay.,2
LORELAI,Okay.,2
SOOKIE,"How dare you do this to me! You're ruining my wedding! It's the most important day of my life! It's my life, it's not Susie St. James, are you listening to me?",2
LORELAI,Good girl.,2
SOOKIE,,2
RORY,Hey.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, hi. Thought you couldn't get here  til later.",2
RORY,Our Franklin meet ing didn't go as long as I thought it would.,2
LORELAI,"Well, lucky for me, more work for you. Here, chronological order, please. So how was your day?",2
RORY,I got an A on my physics test.,2
LORELAI,Aw.,2
RORY,And I finished Candide and I convinced a boy that Paris would probably never attack his rabbi.,2
LORELAI,"So uneventful, huh?",2
RORY,"Pretty much. Mom, um, I know you're probably not gonna wanna do this.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, I will. . .unless it's something that I don't wanna do.",2
RORY,Do you wanna be the parent advisor on my economics project?,2
LORELAI,"Ooh, Rory, gosh.",2
RORY,I'm kind of in a spot.,2
LORELAI,No one else can do it?,2
RORY,Nope.,2
LORELAI,You checked?,2
RORY,Yes.,2
LORELAI,You double checked?,2
RORY,Yes.,2
LORELAI,And no one else can do it so you came slummin g after me and I'm your last choice?,2
RORY,Of course.,2
LORELAI,I appreciate that.,2
RORY,I'm totally stuck.,2
LORELAI,"Well, if you're stuck, I'll do it.",2
RORY,Thanks.,2
LORELAI,"But   ooh, hey, what about your grandfather, retired business titan?",2
RORY,What about him?,2
LORELAI,He'd be perfect.,2
RORY,But this is a business project and the word business has been kind of taboo in that house since he left the firm. Asking him mig ht remind him of that and upset him.,2
LORELAI,Or he'll be thrilled that you thought of him.,2
RORY,"Hm, you're not just saying that because you don't wanna do it?",2
LORELAI,"No, I really think he would enjoy helping you. You would be doing me a big favor  cause then I wouldn't have to feel guilty about being so reluctant to help you out myself.",2
RORY,"All right, I'll give it a shot.",2
LORELAI,Good girl.,2
RORY,Would you really have felt guilty?,2
LORELAI,"No, but I would've felt guilty about not feeling guilty and you can see how that could just go on forever.",2
RORY,Miss Gilmore and the vicious circle.,2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,Hey Grandpa.,2
RICHARD,"Rory, this is a surprise.",2
RORY,I was just in the area and I thought I'd pay a call.,2
RICHARD,"Well, how very continental of you. I would hug you, but I have various forms of viscous fluid on my clothing.",2
RORY,I'll take a rain check.,2
RICHARD,Very good.,2
RORY,How's she running?,2
RICHARD,"Ah, she's a bit, oh, obstinate today.",2
RORY,"Well, girls can get that way.",2
RICHARD,"Mm, indeed. So you were in the neighborhood?",2
RORY,"Yeah, and I actually have a little favor to ask you, if it's okay.",2
RICHARD,"Oh, ask away.",2
RORY,"Okay. There's this project at school and, uh, it's for my economics class.",2
RICHARD,"Good subject, pragmatic.",2
RORY,"Yeah, and we have to come up with a consumer product, all make believe, and there's sort of a contest at the end and we sort of need an advisor.",2
RICHARD,An advisor?,2
RORY,"Yeah, someone who's experienced in business who can come to a few meetings, make suggestions. I mean, I totally understand if you can't do it, but I just thought I would ask.",2
RICHARD,"Well, I'm not sure how much help I could be. I've never actually created a consumer product.",2
RORY,"That's okay, we kids haven't either.",2
RICHARD,"Yes, I suppose you haven't.",2
RORY,"If you can't do it or if you don't wanna do it, I totally understand.",2
RICHARD,"Well, things are a little bit hectic right now.",2
RORY,"Oh, yeah, I know.",2
RICHARD,"And it is short notice, after all.",2
RORY,"Very short, very short. Um, you know what, forget I even asked.",2
EMILY,"Rory, I didn't know you were here!",2
RORY,Hi Grandma.,2
EMILY,"You didn't hug your grandfather, did you?",2
RORY,"I took a rain check. Well, I better go.",2
EMILY,"But you just got here. We have cookies, would you like cookies?",2
RORY,"No, thank you. Mom's expecting me at the inn. And Grandpa, really, don't worry about it. I just thought I would ask.",2
RICHARD,"I'm fine, Rory. Thank you for asking.",2
RORY,Bye.,2
EMILY,"Ask what, what did she ask?",2
RICHARD,"Oh, something for her economics class. It's nothing really.",2
EMILY,That doesn't sound like nothing. What about her economics class? Is she having trouble?,2
RICHARD,"No, Emily. She merely asked me to participate in some, uh, project at school and I respectfully declined.",2
EMILY,You declined?,2
RICHARD,"Leave it, Emily.",2
EMILY,Why did you decline?,2
RICHARD,"Let's talk about it later, Emily. I'm busy.",2
EMILY,Busy? You've been poking around that stupid engine for the last three weeks and all it does is spray at you. You're not too busy.,2
RICHARD,"Emily, I am in the middle of something here and I don't expect you to understand it.",2
EMILY,You're not going to help her?,2
RICHARD,Can we talk about this later?,2
EMILY,"Well, I never thought I'd see the day.",2
RICHARD,What day?,2
EMILY,The day Richard Gilmore would disappoint his granddaughter like this.,2
RICHARD,"Oh, Emily, please.",2
EMILY,"So, tell me Ric hard, is this how it's going to be from now on?",2
RICHARD,What are you talking about?,2
EMILY,"I just want to know what to expect from you. Because the bouncing from one thing to another, the moping and silence in your den for days, all of that I accepted. . .but your turning your back on Rory!",2
RICHARD,I did not turn my back on her.,2
EMILY,"You adore that little girl, she means everything to you, remember?",2
RICHARD,Emily!,2
EMILY,,2
LANE,Sales!,2
RORY,Lane.,2
LANE,Sales!,2
RORY,It's just a stupid test.,2
LANE,"Lane Kim, you have shown a genuine aptitude for sales.",2
RORY,It doesn't mean anything.,2
LANE,"Hello ma'am, I see you're eyeing the Whip-o-Matic, nice choice! This baby's right off the truck, and let me tell you, if you're looking for something to fulfill all your whipping needs, you've come to the right place because as Devo says   if a problem comes along you must whip it, as long as you whip it with a Whip-o-Matic!",2
RORY,"Wow, you are good.",2
LANE,Stop it.,2
RORY,I'll take two.,2
LANE,I don't wanna be in sales!,2
RORY,You don't have to be.,2
LANE,I wanna do something cool.,2
RORY,Sell refrigerators.,2
LANE,You are not funny.,2
RORY,"Look, you are taking this aptitude test way too seriously.",2
LANE,It's the fourth time I've taken it and it's the fourth time it's come up sales.,2
RORY,"Lane, in ten years, we will be having lunch in Paris and we will not be discussing whether or not you made your quota.",2
LANE,"Right, so I'm gonna be a sucky salesman?",2
RORY,Changing subject now.,2
DEAN,Hey.,2
RORY,"Oh, hey.",2
DEAN,"How are ya, Lane?",2
LANE,"Only as good as my last sale, Dean.",2
RORY,"Ignore her, she's lost her mind.",2
DEAN,"Got it. So, uh, what are you doing?",2
RORY,We're going over to Sissy's to buy some shoes.,2
LANE,And pick up a job application.,2
RORY,You will now face the wall quietly please.,2
DEAN,"Well, after you're done shoe shopping, come by my softball game.",2
RORY,"Oh, well   .",2
DEAN,You haven't been to a game in awhile.,2
RORY,"I know, but   .",2
DEAN,You said you missed seeing them.,2
RORY,"I do, but I thought we were getting together tonight.",2
DEAN,We are.,2
RORY,"Well, then I should really get my philosophy homework out of the way.",2
DEAN,Do it at the game.,2
RORY,My homework?,2
DEAN,Yeah.,2
RORY,"But if I'm doing my homework, doesn't that defeat the point of going to see you play?",2
DEAN,You can't glance up in between nihilistic theories?,2
RORY,"I can, but what's the point?",2
DEAN,What?,2
RORY,Why don't I do my homework at home and I will go see you play next week.,2
DEAN,"Well, I   .",2
RORY,I promise I'll be there.,2
DEAN,"Okay, sure.",2
RORY,"Great, so, tonight?",2
DEAN,"Yeah, I'll be by at seven.",2

LORELAI,What   .,2
MICHELorelai,Cleaning supply order. Here.,2
LORELAI,That's the   .,2
MICHELorelai,"Staff insurance forms. Initial here, date it here.",2
LORELAI,And I just   .,2
MICHELorelai,You just okayed the vaccination of all those filthy ducks in the south pond.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, aren't I nice.",2
MICHELorelai,"Yes, a regular Dr. Dolittle.",2
GISELLE,Uh! Michel!,2
MICHELorelai,Zeelee!,2
GISELLE,"Ah! Mon dieu, you are gorgeous! Come, come! Embrassez maman!",2
MICHELorelai,"Maman, j'aime ton visite. What are you doing here? I was going to pick you up at the airport, you wicked creature.",2
GISELLE,"I had to come ear ly. I wanted to buy presents before I see you since I know you are a materialistic vulture. All right, back up. Turn turn turn. Thank God I have the perfect son. If you had been ugly, I don't know what I would've done.",2
MICHELorelai,Boarding school?,2
GISELLE,In Switzerland.,2
MICHELorelai,"Come. Lorelai, this is my mother, Giselle.",2
LORELAI,"Well, it's very nice to meet you.",2
GISELLE,"Oh my God, those eyes. Are they real?",2
LORELAI,"Yes, they are.",2
GISELLE,"Well, then, if there's a God, he is terribly cruel to bestow those eyes and that face to one person.",2
LORELAI,"I'm sorry, can you be my mom, too?",2
MICHELorelai,"I'm going to show her around, okay?",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, make sure you see Sookie.",2
MICHELorelai,Why?,2
LORELAI,Sookie wants to meet your mom.,2
GISELLE,"Yes, Michel, I must meet your friends. I did not raise you to be rude.",2
MICHELorelai,"You did, too.",2
GISELLE,"I did, didn't I? Come, show me off.",2
MICHELorelai,"Oh, have you been using those free weights I sent you?",2
GISELLE,"Yes, they hold down my papers beautifully.",2
MICHELorelai,"A lazy, silly woman.",2
GISELLE,,2
RORY,"I really appreciate you doing this, Grandpa.",2
RICHARD,"Oh, well, of course.",2
RORY,"I mean, I know you weren't really thrilled with the idea.",2
RICHARD,"No, no, no, no, that's not true.",2
RORY,But I told everybody to have their idea pitches prepared so that we can get you in and out of there as quickly as possible.,2
RICHARD,"Rory, this is an assignment. We will give it the time that it requires.",2
RORY,Okay.,2
RICHARD,"However, efficient is always best.",2
RORY,I totally understand.,2
RORY,"Hey. Everyone, this is my grandfather, Richard Gilmore. This is Louise, Madeline, Paris, Brad, and Chip.",2
RICHARD,Nice to meet you all.,2
RORY,"So, do you wanna say a few words before we start?",2
RICHARD,"Uh, oh, no no no, I'm here to advise. I'll uh. . .I'll sit back here and observe and advise, uh, if necessary.",2
RORY,Okay. So I guess we can start with the idea pitches. Who wants to go first?,2
LOUISE,I will.,2
RORY,"Okay, Louise has the floor.",2
LOUISE,"I couldn't find my new lip gloss this morning. I had just bought it and it's the perfect shade of pink. Plus, it has this major shine with minor stickiness, meaning no fear of your hair attaching itself to your face when the wind kicks up.",2
MADELINE,A coup.,2
LOUISE,"I know. So, of course, fifteen minutes later, tardy and glossless, I left the house and I had to rely on Madeline for my source of lip color for the day. Not an ideal solution.",2
MADELINE,Major skin tone mismatch.,2
PARIS,"I'm sorry, group leader, could you ask the Pigeon sisters if there is a point to this opus?",2
RORY,"Louise, what's your idea?",2
LOUISE,A lipstick Lo-Jack.,2
RORY,Excuse me?,2
LOUISE,"A lipstick tracking device. You attach it to a tube and you hook it up to a remote and next time you're searching, you just point and sh**t.",2
MADELINE,I'd buy one.,2
RORY,"Okay, um, Louise, that's a very interesting idea, but I think we should think of something that appeals to both boys and girls. Anyone else?",2
MADELINE,"Okay, I've got one   a locker robot. It would talk and tell you facts, help you with your homework, carry your stuff. And you could fit it in your locker until you're ready to go home.",2
RORY,"Okay, but that means that we would actually have to build a robot.",2
MADELINE,"Yes, we would.",2
RORY,Who knows how to do that?,2
MADELINE,I don't know. He looks like he should know.,2
BRAD,I've never built a robot.,2
LOUISE,"But you've tried, haven't you?",2
BRAD,"Yes, I have.",2
RORY,"Okay, let's just try to keep the ideas down to things that we can actually accomplish. And I guess Paris is next.",2
PARIS,"The average teenager spends seven hours a day at school. Seven hours where he or she is busy walking from class to class   indoors, outdoors, in all types of weather. At the same time, that same teenager is going through major physical changes within his or her own body. The combo of the action with the environment in addition to the hormonal imbalance can only lead to one thing   accidents.",2
MADELINE,What are you talking about?,2
PARIS,"Monday morning, Muffin wakes up and looks in the mirror.  Oh no, I have a zit on my face. I'll just look down when I walk so hunky football player won't notice.' And bam   Muffin smacks right into the cafeteria wall. Ouch, that's gotta hurt.",2
MADELINE,Who's Muffin?,2
PARIS,This is why I'm proposing manufacturing something that no teenager should be without   a first aid kit.,2
LOUISE,A first aid kit?,2
PARIS,"Specially designed to fit in a locker with minimum space disruption. Bandaids, antiseptic, cotton balls, q-tips, ace bandages, aspirin.",2
RORY,"I don't know, it's possible. Does anyone have any questions about it?",2
RICHARD,"They sell these things in every drug store, do they not?",2
PARIS,"Yes, they do.",2
RICHARD,"There's also a registered nurse on every campus. Her office would contain the products that you're talking about, correct?",2
PARIS,Possibly.,2
RICHARD,"Well, what makes you think you can get a young person to spend good money on something that they could get for free, or at least at a lower cost?",2
PARIS,Because I know one thing about the modern teenager.,2
RICHARD,And what is that?,2
PARIS,That you can get them to buy anything as long as it comes in a leopard print.,2
LOUISE,True.,2
MADELINE,Very true.,2
PARIS,"We get them with style. We dress up the kits with sparkles, colors, pictures of bands. Sport themes for the boys, animal pictures for the puppy and unicorn bunch, chess boards for the Bobby Fischer freaks   a style for every taste. Plus, we use neon bandaids, pink or blue gauze for the bandages, anything that seems young or flashy or bright.",2
RICHARD,And that is how you intend to set the business world on its ear?,2
PARIS,That's right.,2
RICHARD,Tricked out first aid kits?,2
PARIS,For the locker.,2
RICHARD,And you really think that's going to work?,2
PARIS,"Yes, I do.",2
RICHARD,So do I.,2
PARIS,Really?,2
RICHARD,"It's perfect. It's simple, it's easy to produce, the possibilities are endless. I love it.",2
RORY,"Well, I think we've got our product.",2
RICHARD,"Now, we need to go through this point by point.",2
PARIS,"Okay, let's do it.",2
RICHARD,,2
LORELAI,Agh!,2
RORY,Hey.,2
LORELAI,Gah!,2
RORY,"Mom! Hello? That ringing is not in your head, you know.",2
LORELAI,"Uh, you've gotta read this Motley Crue book. I swear, you get to the point where Ozzy Osbourne snorts a row of ants and you think, it cannot get any grosser, and then you turn the page and oh, hello, yes it can! It's excellent!",2
RORY,Why didn't you answer the phone?,2
LORELAI,"Because I firmly believe that once you've experienced something five thousand times, you need to move on.",2
RORY,What are you talking about?,2
LORELAI,I knew who it was.,2
RORY,Who was it?,2
LORELAI,The same person who's called the machine so many times now that I actually heard it sigh.,2
RORY,Dean?,2
LORELAI,Dean the determined.,2
RORY,Oh man.,2
LORELAI,Five bucks says I know who that is.,2
RORY,Hello?,2
RICHARD,"Rory, it's your grandfather.",2
RORY,"Oh, hey Grandpa.",2
LORELAI,He did that on purpose.,2
RICHARD,I'd like to discuss tomorrow's meeting.,2
RORY,Okay.,2
RICHARD,I was thinking that we should relocate.,2
RORY,Midtown?,2
RICHARD,Here.,2
RORY,Your house?,2
RICHARD,It'll be more comfortable with infinitely better snacks.,2
RORY,"Yeah, that sounds great.",2
RICHARD,Wonderful. I'll call the group.,2
RORY,"Okay, well, then I guess I'll see you tomorrow.",2
RICHARD,Tomorrow.,2
RORY,Bye.,2
LORELAI,What'd he want?,2
RORY,He wanted to move the location of our meeting to his house tomorrow and to cost you five bucks.,2
LORELAI,"So that's going well, huh, Grandpa doing that thing with you at school?",2
RORY,"Yeah, I think he's having fun with it.",2
LORELAI,See? Did your brilliant mother call it or what?,2
RORY,"Yes, she did.",2
LORELAI,"You're damn lucky to have that magnificent woman in your life, you know that, don't you?",2
RORY,It's whispered in my ear every night when I'm about to go to sleep.,2
LORELAI,"Well, you won't let me w rite it in your underwear anymore. Hey, check the machine so I can erase the messages.",2
RORY,"Oh, right.",2
LORELAI,Agh!,2
DEAN,"Hey, it's me. Uh, it's four o'clock, call me when you got home. Hey, uh, it's four thirty. I'm home, call me. It's quarter to five   where are you? I'll try paging you. It's five-thirty. Did you get my page? Call with the answer.",2
RORY,They are not all from him.,2
DEAN,"Hey, I totally forgot you were getting home at six.",2
LORELAI,"And yet, oddly, even after remembering that information. . .",2
DEAN,"Hey, it's five forty-five and I just thought I'd see if you got home early.",2
LORELAI,"I swear, that boy would make a good drinking game.",2
RORY,This is crazy. Ten messages?,2
LORELAI,Plus the four that I took from him personally before I stopped answering the phone.,2
RORY,Right.,2
LORELAI,"Honey, you gotta ease up on that love potion you've been giving him or he's gonna start showing up at David Letterman's house soon.",2
RORY,Ugh.,2
LORELAI,What's the matter?,2
RORY,Fourteen messages.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, so, it's a little   .",2
RORY,It's a little too much.,2
LORELAI,"So, what's up? Are you guys fighting or something?",2
RORY,What are you talking about?,2
LORELAI,"I mean, did something happen to set off the phone craze?",2
RORY,"No, everything's been fine, everything's been calm. No more incidents, I don't get it.",2
LORELAI,"Well, if I had to guess, I would say he's feeling a little insecure about something.",2
RORY,But why?,2
LORELAI,Rory.,2
RORY,"But I spend every free moment with him, I call him, I page him.",2
LORELAI,"I know, you've been good.",2
RORY,"And nothing seems to be enough, nothing seems to make things normal again.",2
LORELAI,Give it some time.,2
RORY,I just want things to be the way they were.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, honey, relationships are hard. Sometimes you go through a weird patch and things get funky for a little while, but just give it a chance. Ride it out, things will calm down again.",2
RORY,,2
GISELLE,"Oh, stop it, stop making me laugh! You are trying to k*ll me! You are trying to make your mother laugh herself to death so you can get away with a grisly crime.",2
MICHELorelai,Your mind is evil.,2
GISELLE,Your soul is empty.,2
MICHELorelai,"You want some coffee, Zeelee?",2
GISELLE,"Yes, darling, thank you.",2
MICHELorelai,I'll be right back.,2
GISELLE,"Ah, hello, blue eyes.",2
LORELAI,Hi Giselle. How was lunch?,2
GISELLE,"Ah, champagne, caviar, the usual.",2
LORELAI,"Ah, sure.",2
GISELLE,And then came out the pasta with terrible things in it. It was perfect.,2
LORELAI,You seem to be having a wonderful time.,2
GISELLE,"I am. I will miss him so much when I go home, but thank goodness, he will have an extra five pounds to rememb er me by after eating all my pasta today, that dirty thieving boy.",2
LORELAI,Michel ate pasta?,2
GISELLE,"Well, yes. Michel loves pasta, he eats it all the time.",2
LORELAI,"Not around us. Here it's all no-carb, low-cal, let me see if I can eat less than the lab rats do.",2
GISELLE,Lab rats?,2
LORELAI,"Better not explained. Anyway, I'm glad you've got him eating pasta, he seems really happy.",2
MICHELorelai,"Coffee, coffee, coffee.",2
GISELLE,"Oh, mm, mm. This is horrible.",2
MICHELorelai,You will drink it and you will like it.,2
GISELLE,You are a curse.,2
MICHELorelai,Let's go shop.,2
GISELLE,"Oh yes, let's go buy something completely useless and pay way too much money for it.",2
MICHELorelai,I love it.,2
GISELLE,Au revoir.,2
MICHELorelai,Au revoir.,2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,We should've waited for Paris.,2
LOUISE,"Hey, she's the one who threw a fit about leaving no later than 3:10.",2
RORY,But she could be standing outside the school right now waiting for us.,2
MADELINE,She has my cell number.,2
LOUISE,I thought you lost your phone.,2
MADELINE,I did. Oh.,2
RORY,We'll call her when we get inside.,2
BRAD,"Tell her I wanted to wait, okay?",2
RORY,Paris.,2
PARIS,"Hey, you're right on time. Come on in.",2
RORY,"Uh, okay.",2
RICHARD,"In the dining room, everyone.",2
RORY,Wow.,2
RICHARD,"Welcome, everyone, to the first official board meeting of the StyleAid Corporation. Will everyone please take a seat?",2
CHIP,I feel like Ivan Bosky.,2
RICHARD,"Rory, you are group leader which translates into chairman of the board, which means you sit at the head of the table.",2
RORY,But that's where you sit.,2
RICHARD,"No, not today. Come on. Now, at this point, I would like to turn the meeting over to Paris who will bring us up to date on our latest developments.",2
PARIS,"Thank you, Richard. First, let me say that I'm glad to see you all here today, at the beginning of what I think is going to be a very exciting experiment.",2
BRAD,"She doesn't have a baseball bat in her hands, does she?",2
PARIS,"Now, I'd like everyone to turn to page one in your presentation booklets. Hey, we haven't gotten to the pencil part yet.",2
BRAD,"Oh, sorry.",2
PARIS,"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the RX-2002.",2
LOUISE,Nice.,2
RORY,Very nice.,2
PARIS,"Now, listed in front of you are all the contents contained in the RX-2002, plus the additional style options, twelve in all. Every one of them waterproof, fireproof, and comes with a five-year warranty.",2
RICHARD,Which is longer than most of your high school careers.,2
PARIS,He is funny.,2
RICHARD,"Now there is also a deluxe model with extra features designed to personalize your kit even more specifically for your needs. There will be a snap-in CD case which can hold up to ten CDs, there's a lighted vanity mirror, and a divided compartment for makeup and knickknacks. A picture frame an d a hidden mini vault for valuables which can be locked for safety.",2
PARIS,"Terrific idea, Richard, really   top notch.",2
RICHARD,"Thank you, Paris.",2
RORY,This is really amazing. I want one of these.,2
RICHARD,"Exactly the point. Now, let's check in with our marketing department. Uh, Madeline, Louise   what have you got for us?",2
MADELINE,"Okay, well, first we go for the obvious   magazines.",2
LOUISE,"You know, Teen, Young Miss, Seventeen.",2
MADELINE,"Spin and Rolling Stone, especially to hit the guys.",2
RICHARD,"I hear that Jane magazine also has a young, hip following.",2
RORY,How do you know about Jane magazine?,2
RICHARD,"I have my ways, young lady.",2
CHIP,We should also check about placing them in certain mall stores.,2
RICHARD,I also think we should go straight to the source.,2
PARIS,The schools?,2
RICHARD,"Why not? School bulletin boards, websites. We can set up tables at football games and pep rallies.",2
EMILY,"Well, how is everyone doing here?",2
RICHARD,"Just fine, Emily.",2
EMILY,Good. Is there enough food?,2
RICHARD,"Yes, there is plenty of food.",2
EMILY,What about ice cream? Would anyone like some ice cream?,2
RICHARD,"Emily, we're in the middle of a business meeting.",2
EMILY,"Oh, ah, well, I'm very sorry. Uh, go back to your business meeting.",2
RICHARD,"Now, I think your projections for. . .",2
EMILY,He's smiling.,2
RORY,I know.,2
EMILY,He's smiling and there's no oil on the carpet.,2
RORY,Life is good.,2
EMILY,"Yes, it is.",2
RICHARD,"Emily, please.",2
EMILY,"I'm going, I'm going.",2
PARIS,"Richard, do you have the third-year projections?",2
RICHARD,,2
LORELAI,Dean.,2
DEAN,Hey.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, how's it going?",2
DEAN,"Uh, just washing Rory's car.",2
LORELAI,I can see that.,2
DEAN,"Well, I mean, I came by to see her and she wasn't here, so I was just gonna wait on the porch but then I noticed that her car looked dirty, so I thought I'd wash it.",2
LORELAI,Mm hmm.,2
DEAN,"Well,  cause sometimes things can get on your car like dirt and certain kinds of sap. It can get into your paint, makes it really hard to get off.",2
LORELAI,Sure.,2
DEAN,"Even water spots, you know. . .after it rains, that can be a real problem.",2
LORELAI,Okay. Would you like a soda?,2
DEAN,"No, I'm fine.",2
LORELAI,Let's go get a soda.,2
DEAN,But I have to wash   .,2
LORELAI,,2
DEAN,"Look, I really didn't mean to bother you. I can just wait outside until Rory gets home.",2
LORELAI,"Honey, Rory's working on her school project today.",2
DEAN,"Oh yeah. I guess I forgot. I mean, she must've told me that she . . . I'm sorry, I forgot.",2
LORELAI,That's okay.,2
DEAN,"So, I'll just go.",2
LORELAI,"No no, come here, just sit down for a sec, okay? Are you all right?",2
DEAN,"Yeah, I'm fine. I just don't remember Rory telling me about her studying today. I swear I wouldn't have come over.",2
LORELAI,Can I maybe give you a little advice?,2
DEAN,Sure.,2
LORELAI,"Okay. First, I just wanna tell you I think you are a great guy. You're so good to Rory. And even though I'd always hoped that she'd be the one girl in the world who wouldn't look at a boy until she was thirty-eight, I'm really glad she found you.",2
DEAN,Thanks.,2
LORELAI,And I know things have been a little off between you two lately.,2
DEAN,Did she say that?,2
LORELAI,"No, I'm saying that. I can see it, and by the way, I get it. But sometimes when things are out of whack, it freaks us out a little and makes us feel like we're losing something that's really important and that scares us even more so we try really hard to hold onto whatever it is we think we're losing and sometimes we hold on a little too hard.",2
DEAN,Too hard?,2
LORELAI,"Like calling ten times in a three hour period, too hard.",2
DEAN,Fourteen times.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, now, see, I was gonna let you slide but hey   an honest man, I like that.",2
DEAN,You think I'm holding on too hard to Rory?,2
LORELAI,I don't think you mean to.,2
DEAN,You think I'm losing her?,2
LORELAI,I think you think you are.,2
DEAN,"Well, I just feel like nothing I do is. . . you know, I just want things back the way they used to be.",2
LORELAI,"I know you do, and they can be.",2
DEAN,How?,2
LORELAI,I know it sounds crazy but sometimes giving people a little bit of space is actually the best thing to do.,2
DEAN,Space?,2
LORELAI,Just a little.,2
DEAN,"Like what? Like don't call her, don't see her?",2
LORELAI,"No, just let her breathe, let her relax, let her come to you for a change.",2
DEAN,"You're not telling me this to get rid of me, are you?",2
LORELAI,"Please, if I was trying to get rid of you I would've started this conversation with,  Let me tell you about my family'. I'm not telling you this to get rid of you, I'm telling you because I think it might help things between you guys. Just try it. If it doesn't work, I promise you can wash my car, too.",2
DEAN,Okay.,2
LORELAI,Do you want a soda?,2
DEAN,"No, thanks. I'm gonna go. Uh, don't tell Rory I was here, okay?",2
LORELAI,"Hey, I'm just sitting here at the table talking to myself. . .again.",2
DEAN,Thanks.,2
LORELAI,,2
SOOKIE,"You know what, forget it! If that's how you run your business, then I deserve this for picking you in the first place. I hate you!",2
LORELAI,Hey.,2
SOOKIE,"Okay, new plan for the invites. We're getting married May fifteenth, four o'clock, front lawn   pass it on.",2
LORELAI,Sookie.,2
SOOKIE,"That's it, word of mouth. They used it for the Revolutionary w*r   who the hell am I to poopoo history, huh? I ask you.",2
MICHELorelai,What the hell is wrong with you?,2
LORELAI,With me?,2
MICHELorelai,"Yes, you! Are you out of your mind?",2
LORELAI,What are you talking about?,2
MICHELorelai,Why in God's name w ould you tell my mother that I do not eat carbs?,2
LORELAI,Because you don't.,2
MICHELorelai,"That is private information, private about me.",2
LORELAI,"Michel, everybody in Stars Hollow knows you don't eat carbs.",2
MICHELorelai,So what?,2
LORELAI,"Calm down, have some toast.",2
MICHELorelai,"Do not talk to my mother ever again, do you understand me?",2
LORELAI,"No, I don't understand. Michel, you and your mother seem crazy about each other. I just assumed since you gave up carbs a year ago, she knew.",2
MICHELorelai,"Yes, well, you know what happens when you assume.",2
LORELAI,What?,2
MICHELorelai,I don't know. Something about a donkey   it's a stupid American phrase.,2
LORELAI,"I don't understand, Michel. You and your mother seem to have the perfect relationship.",2
MICHELorelai,"Yes, because I tell her nothing. We keep all subjects light and fluffy. We talk about clothes and food and Posh Spice and David Beckham and that is all. Nothing of value, nothing of substance.",2
LORELAI,I'm sorry.,2
MICHELorelai,"Now she knows I've been hiding something from her. Suddenly she's asking questions. Why did I leave France at eighteen? Where do I go at night? Who are my friends? What do they do? Where do they live? Why have I chosen this career? On and on and on and on   it never ends! I can't stand it, she's a complete pain. She won't stop. I took a six hour bath last night just to escape the incessant nagging. You did this to me! You turned my Giselle into a mother, and I hate you for it! I hate you very, very much!",2
SOOKIE,"So, feel better now?",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, I do, thanks.",2
SOOKIE,,2
PARIS,"Okay, I swept the room and I have to tell you, all sad. I think we're a lock.",2
RORY,Really? I actually thought the locker alarm was pretty good.,2
PARIS,"Please, no one even looks when a car alarm goes off. How effective do you think a locker alarm s going to be? Nope, I feel it, we are it. What's the word?",2
RICHARD,Every single idea in this room is completely worthless.,2
PARIS,Yes.,2
RICHARD,"There's a lot of wasted cardboard in here, my friend.",2
PARIS,We are going to win.,2
RICHARD,"Yes, we are.",2
RORY,"Okay, the two of you need to take a time out.",2
HEADMASTERory,"Richard? Richard, hello.",2
RICHARD,"Hanlin, good to see you.",2
HEADMASTERory,What are you doing here?,2
RICHARD,"Well, I'm actually advising Rory on her business project   the RX-2002.",2
HEADMASTERory,"Oh, well, that's wonderful. You look great.",2
RICHARD,I feel great.,2
HEADMASTERory,We don't see you at the club that much anymore.,2
RICHARD,"No, I've been very busy lately.",2
HEADMASTERory,"Now, did I hear correctly   did you retire?",2
RICHARD,Right before Christmas.,2
HEADMASTERory,So it's true. I told it to Bitty and I couldn't believe it when we heard that.,2
RICHARD,"Well, a man can't work forever.",2
HEADMASTERory,"No, that's true. I just can't picture you retired.",2
RICHARD,It's been wonderful lately. Best move I've ever made. It's given me a lot of time to do a lot of wonderful things.,2
HEADMASTERory,"Well, that does sound nice. What kinds of things are you doing?",2
RICHARD,"Well, this.",2
HEADMASTERory,"Well, there you go. Unfortunately, some of us aren't living the good life quite yet. I've got to get back. It's been wonderful seeing you, Richard. Let's have dinner soon.",2
RICHARD,I would like that very much.,2
HEADMASTERory,I'll have Bitty give Em a call.,2
RICHARD,You do that.,2
PARIS,Did you see the brilliant hose hook idea over at table five? A hook on your belt for your garden hose. There's a Buster Keaton routine waiting to happen.,2
RICHARD,So how are we doing?,2
RORY,Paris is practicing spiking the football then doing a backflip.,2
RICHARD,Well.,2
HEADMASTERory,"Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, all the projects have now been reviewed.",2
PARIS,Here we go.,2
HEADMASTERory,"And before we announce the winner, I must commend everyone for their fine work. There are many, many good ideas here today. It makes me proud.",2
PARIS,"Move it along, padre.",2
HEADMASTERory,"Now I'd like to announce the winner   table 10, Miss Traster's class with the locker alarm.",2
RICHARD,"I don't understand, how is that possible?",2
PARIS,"This is so lame. That alarm doesn't even work, I was just over there.",2
RICHARD,This is the most ludicrous thing I've ever heard.,2
RORY,"Grandpa, it doesn't matter.",2
RICHARD,It certainly does matter. You've all put in an extraordinary amount of time and effort and thought into this project. It deserved to win.,2
PARIS,Yeah.,2
RORY,"Well, I wanted to win too, but we didn't.",2
RICHARD,I'm going to talk to the headmaster about this.,2
RORY,I wish you wouldn't.,2
RICHARD,"You were robbed, Rory, and I'm not going to sit back and simply watch it happen. Hanlin, good, I want a word with you.",2
HEADMASTERory,Is something wrong?,2
RICHARD,This contest is a disgrace.,2
HEADMASTERory,I beg your pardon?,2
RICHARD,I have been in the business world for thirty-five years.,2
HEADMASTERory,I know this.,2
RICHARD,"And in those thirty-five years, I've seen ideas come and I've seen ideas go, and I've learned a few things about what flies and what doesn't.",2
HEADMASTERory,I'm sure you have.,2
RICHARD,"I am telling you that out there in the real world, there is no way that a locker alarm that doesn't even work properly would be a viable business investment.",2
HEADMASTERory,"Richard, we're not in the real world, we are in a school.",2
RICHARD,"Yes, a school that should be training children for the real world.",2
HEADMASTERory,"Richard, calm down.",2
RICHARD,I demand a recount.,2
HEADMASTERory,"Very well. I just recounted, the alarm still wins.",2
RICHARD,Hanlin!,2
HEADMASTERory,"Richard, your project was very good. It was definitely in the running. You should be proud.",2
RICHARD,"This is not my project, this is their project, the children's project.",2
HEADMASTERory,Really?,2
RICHARD,"Yes! This has nothing to do with me, it's for the children!",2
HEADMASTERory,,2
RORY,It was awful. He looked so upset. His face was turning red and he was practically shaking.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, did you notice when he gets mad he gets taller?",2
RORY,Mom.,2
LORELAI,I don't know how he does it but he actually grows.,2
RORY,Stop.,2
LORELAI,"The day I told him I was pregnant, twenty-four feet tall. It freaked the birds.",2
RORY,"Hey, I'm upset here.",2
LORELAI,"Honey, you did nothing. You went to your grandfather, who you greatly admire and actually like hanging out with, to ask for his help and advice. That's lovely and thoughtful.",2
RORY,Please help me out tonight   no mention of work or Chilton or school or retirement.,2
LORELAI,"Nothing but politics and religion, got it.",2
EMILY,Hello girls.,2
LORELAI,Hi Mom.,2
RORY,Hi Grandma.,2
EMILY,"Come in , come in . Dinner's almost ready. Richard, the girls are here. Richard? He came home today, didn't say a word, stomped off to his study, slammed the door, and he's been holed up in there ever since.",2
RORY,Really?,2
EMILY,I can't even get him to answer me.,2
LORELAI,"Well, are you sure he's still in there?",2
EMILY,Of course he's still in there. The door's right there. I would've seen if he came out.,2
LORELAI,Sorry.,2
EMILY,Not everyone leaves this house by climbing out the window and jumping into a waiting hot rod.,2
RORY,Maybe someone should go talk to him.,2
EMILY,I don't know what to do. What on earth happened today?,2
RORY,Things didn't go very well at the business fair.,2
EMILY,What happened?,2
LORELAI,It was terrible   the tenth graders staged a hostile takeover of the eleventh graders.,2
RORY,Our project didn't win and Grandpa took it badly.,2
EMILY,"Well, I am at my wit's end if that man is going to fall apart over a high school project.",2
LORELAI,"It's just a weird time for him, Mom.",2
RORY,I feel so awful.,2
LORELAI,Maybe he should go talk to somebody.,2
EMILY,Like whom?,2
LORELAI,Like a psychiatrist?,2
EMILY,What?,2
LORELAI,"Well, maybe it would help.",2
EMILY,We do not go to psychiatrists.,2
LORELAI,"Mom, there's nothing wrong with getting help.",2
EMILY,"Lorelai Gilmore, are you seriously suggesting that your father go to a complete stranger and talk about his personal life?",2
LORELAI,Lots of people swear by it.,2
EMILY,"Yes, disturbed people, deviants, people with multiple personalities who see things and hear talking to them and roam the streets talking to themselves and licking parking meters.",2
LORELAI,Mom.,2
EMILY,"Next thing you know, you'll be suggesting I go to a psychiatrist.",2
LORELAI,Too many comebacks   I cannot pick.,2
EMILY,"Richard, is that you?",2
RICHARD,"Of course it's me. Oh Rory, you're here, wonderful. Hello Lorelai.",2
LORELAI,Hey.,2
RICHARD,"Well, I am starving. What's for dinner?",2
EMILY,"What's for dinner? What do you mean, what's for dinner?",2
RICHARD,"Well, I thought the question was relatively clear, but I'd be glad to rephrase it for you. Eh, what sort of food products will appear on various plates this evening?",2
EMILY,"Richard Gilmore, you come home in a huff and you lock yourself in that study all afternoon. . .",2
RICHARD,"Well, I had a lot of thinking to do, a lot of thinking. I owe that to you young lady.",2
RORY,I'm sorry.,2
RICHARD,You should certainly not be sorry.,2
EMILY,"Richard, what   put that roll down and explain yourself!",2
RICHARD,"This whole week, this whole experience with Rory and the locker first aid kit   that is a damn good idea, by the way, no matter what those yarnheads at that school of yours say. Anyway, this whole week made me realize something   I don't want to be retired.",2
EMILY,You what?,2
RICHARD,"I don't like it. I hate it, as a matter of fact.",2
LORELAI,But Dad   .,2
RICHARD,"It's boring. I have absolutely no idea what to do with myself. And frankly, I am tired of trying to find something to fill up my time.",2
RORY,So what are you going to do?,2
RICHARD,I am going to work.,2
EMILY,Are you thinking about asking for your job back?,2
RICHARD,"Oh, God no! No no no no no no. I have decided to go into business for myself.",2
LORELAI,Wow.,2
EMILY,What?,2
RORY,Cool.,2
RICHARD,"It is cool, isn't it?",2
EMILY,But what are you going to do?,2
RICHARD,"Well, I'm not sure yet. Perhaps I'll consult, maybe take on a partner, maybe I'll even teach.",2
LORELAI,What?,2
RICHARD,"Well, you don't have to say it like that.",2
LORELAI,Sorry. What?,2
RICHARD,I think thirty five years of experience will qualify me to teach a course or two at that local business college of yours.,2
LORELAI,"Oh my God. It's Who's the Boss, the later years.",2
EMILY,"Richard, are you serious about this?",2
RICHARD,As a heart attack.,2
EMILY,"But, but   .",2
RICHARD,"I haven't felt this good in a very long time, Emily. I have the buzz, and I owe it all to you.",2
RORY,Glad to be of service.,2
EMILY,He's going to teach.,2
LORELAI,Or consult.,2
EMILY,Or consult.,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,"Okay, that dinner was good.",2
RORY,All of Grandma's dinners are good.,2
LORELAI,"I know, but this one had the rolls.",2
RORY,"Aw, those were excellent rolls.",2
LORELAI,Weren't they? Hot and buttery with that split top thing going on. I miss the rolls.,2
RORY,"Well, she can make more next week.",2
LORELAI,That's okay. I got four in my purse.,2
RORY,You do not.,2
LORELAI,Go ahead and check.,2
RORY,Have you no shame?,2
LORELAI,Ha!,2
LORELAI,"Ah, who's that?",2
RORY,It's Dean.,2
LORELAI,Really? How many pages does that make for today?,2
RORY,Just one.,2
LORELAI,You're kidding.,2
RORY,In two days.,2
LORELAI,Wow!,2
RORY,I know. He hasn't called or mysteriously appeared by my side or anything.,2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,I hope so. I actually got a chance to miss him today.,2
LORELAI,That sounds good.,2
RORY,It is good.,2
LORELAI,Do you wanna grab my cell phone and give him a call?,2
RORY,"Oh, no, tomorrow's fine.",2
LORELAI,Are you sure? It's still early. You guys could hook up for a little while.,2
RORY,I'm hanging out with Lane tonight.,2
LORELAI,Lane?,2
RORY,"Yeah, we have some serious CD listening to do. We're way behind on all the Elvis Costello reissues coming out.",2
LORELAI,I didn't think Lane could hang out past nine.,2
RORY,"Her mom's at an antique fair in Woodbury until Sunday, and her grandmother's staying with her but she's asleep by six so we thought we'd be really bad and sneak out to Luke's.",2
LORELAI,You're going to Luke's?,2
RORY,"Yeah, maybe.",2
LORELAI,"Honey, why go to Luke's? Um, I mean, you just had ten rolls.",2
RORY,"No, you had ten rolls, and I don't even know if we'll go to Luke's. It's just a maybe.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, okay. Well, you guys have fun.",2
RORY,"Okay, see you later.",2
LORELAI,Sure you don't wanna call Dean?,2

LORELAI,"I'm tired, too. Pick another movie.",2
TAYLORory,"A lot of hard work and careful planning go into those nights. You never help plan, you never volunteer, you have never once been a ticket ripper as long as I have been involved in that function. Personally, missy, if you can't participate with a smile and a hug, then you shouldn't participate at all.",2
LORELAI,"I shouldn't, but I am. Pick another movie.",2
TAYLORory,No!,2
LORELAI,"Taylor, there's millions of great movies out there. Any one of them would be better than The Yearling for the fourth time.",2
TAYLORory,"Fine, you do it!",2
LORELAI,What?,2
TAYLORory,You pick the movie.,2
LORELAI,Seriously?,2
TAYLORory,"I've had it. You have such strong opinions about everything, you go out and try to find a movie that everybody will enjoy. It's all yours. I relinquish my movie picking crown to you.",2
LORELAI,He relinquished his crown.,2
RORY,I heard.,2

LORELAI,Or Sophie's Choice.,2
RORY,Very similar.,2
LORELAI,"Oh man, I can't choose, there's too many great movies. The burden is overwhelming. I'm sinking under the pressure. My grasp on reality is slipping. I can't do it, I can't hold on, I just can't, I just. . .ooh, hey, how about Cabin Boy?",2

CHRISTOPHERory,Sounds about right.,2
RORY,So how are things there? How's Sherry?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Oh, uh, nothing much is going on here. Same ol', same ol'. Hey, listen, uh, I've gotta cut this talk short but I sent you an email, so read it and add an extra forty minutes onto my time for next week's call, deal?",2

JESS,Then I need the answers.,2
LANE,There's a pen in my bag.,2
JESS,I can't go through your bag.,2
LANE,"Yes, you can.",2
JESS,"My mother told me never go through a lady's bag. . .at least, not until you're a couple blocks away. I'm just kidding, she never said that. Though it sounds like pretty good advice, doesn't it?",2
LANE,Take it and shut up.,2
JESS,,2
PRINCIPALorelai,Come in .,2
LUKE,"Yeah, I got a call you wanted to see me. I'm, uh, Luke Danes   Jess Mariano's uncle.",2
PRINCIPALorelai,"Jess Mariano. Ah yes, come in.",2
LUKE,Thanks. So is everything okay? I didn't see any cop cars or fire trucks out front so. . .,2
PRINCIPALorelai,"Mr. Danes, please have a seat.",2
LUKE,"A seat? So this is a seat thing. Okay, what's he done?",2
PRINCIPALorelai,Why do you assume he's done something?,2
LUKE,"Oh, I don't know. You're staring at a folder that's looking a little thick there. I get a call to come right over here and talk to you, so why don't you just tell me what he's done?",2
PRINCIPALorelai,Nothing.,2
LUKE,Nothing?,2
PRINCIPALorelai,"No homework, no class participation, his attendance record is erratic at best. His attitude towards his teachers, it ranges from indifferent to hostile. He shows no interest in school activities or other students, and there is the issue of the disappearing baseballs.",2
LUKE,The what?,2
PRINCIPALorelai,Every baseball on campus seems to have disappeared.,2
LUKE,"Oh, come on, you don't think Jess seriously. . . I'll check when I get home.",2
PRINCIPALorelai,"I appreciate that. Now, I don't suspect we'll solve every problem in one meeting, so let's focus on the most important one   his grades.",2
LUKE,Not good?,2
PRINCIPALorelai,Not good.,2
LUKE,"Well, I'll have a talk with him about that.",2
PRINCIPALorelai,You're gonna have to do a lot more than talk to him. You're gonna have to help him.,2
LUKE,"Me? Oh, no, I'm not the one you want helping him. I went to this school   I'm sure there's still a note stuffed in there about me w ith the words  trade school' stamped in really big letters.",2
PRINCIPALorelai,"Well, if you can't help him, you're gonna have to find someone who can.",2
LUKE,Like who?,2
PRINCIPALorelai,A relative.,2
LUKE,"I don't think so. Believe me, I'm the Einstein of the clan.",2
PRINCIPALorelai,"Well, maybe you need to hire a tutor.",2
LUKE,A tutor? Oh geez.,2
PRINCIPALorelai,"Mr. Danes, Jess is flunking out. He's not going to make it. Now, if something it not done about that right now, he's going to repeat this year. I'm sorry, but that's where we are.",2
LUKE,"Okay, well, if that's where we are, then I'll just have to figure something out.",2
PRINCIPALorelai,Good. And let's not forget about those baseballs.,2
LUKE,Right.,2
PRINCIPALorelai,Been using tennis balls for a couple of weeks.,2
LUKE,Wow.,2
PRINCIPALorelai,Very different results.,2
LUKE,,2
LORELAI,"If we take off Fletch and Urban Cowboy, we still have seventy-five possibilities.",2
RORY,How are we gonna pick just one?,2
LORELAI,"I don't know. Maybe we should do like a movie marathon weekend. You know, just show one movie after the other for three days and charge everyone a fortune, gauge them of bottled water, have those really little disgusting bathrooms   it'd be like our own Woodstock.",2
TAYLORory,"Ah, good, there you are. I have something for you.",2
LORELAI,What?,2
TAYLORory,This.,2
LORELAI,Geez.,2
TAYLORory,"Now, when you get through this and make your decision, the number of the man you need to contact is inside on the first page.",2
LORELAI,What man? What is this?,2
TAYLORory,That is the list of titles that are available for you to pick from for the movie night.,2
LORELAI,"The list of titles? I'm sorry, can't we just pick our own movie?",2
TAYLORory,You're not serious?,2
LORELAI,"Not often, but just there   yeah, I had some serious going.",2
TAYLORory,"My dear girl, movies are expensive and we get fabulous deals with this particular place. They have a wide selection and they're very friendly and since it all goes to charity, they agree to give us anything on that list for free.",2
LORELAI,So we have to pick a movie off this list?,2
TAYLORory,"Oh, it's fun. They put the movie title over here and a brief description of the storyline over here and believe me, there are some ex cellent movies on that list. Really, top notch.",2
LORELAI,"Arctic Flight   man with plane flies charter to Alaska, hired by bear hunter who turns out to be Russian spy, love story develops with pilot and school teachers, Eskimos do tribal dance. You made this up.",2
TAYLORory,"Don't I wish. Okay, well, I can't wait to see what you come up with. Bye girls.",2
LORELAI,Bye.,2

LORELAI,Oh.,2
RORY,"Shark fisherman on ocean, Mexican cantina with tequila and Mariachi music, has good scene of catching and cleaning shark.",2
LORELAI,"Where Are Your Children? Hip music and singing about kids getting into trouble, sneaking booze into clubs, stealing car, fight between girls, romance starts then guy goes in the Navy.",2
RORY,"Huh. Sudden Danger   mom dies of gas asphyxiation, son blamed, good kiss scene.",2
LORELAI,"Suspense   ice skater falls in love with hired help. Well, at least now I know how Snow Dogs got made.",2
LUKE,"Hey. Listen, have you seen Jess?",2
RORY,I think I saw him go upstairs earlier.,2
LUKE,,2
LUKE,"Oh, good, you're here. So, you file those under the band names?",2
JESS,Genre.,2
LUKE,"Right, genre, that makes sense, makes a lot of sense. Oh, what is that? Something for school?",2
JESS,Nope.,2
LUKE,"Oh, well, shouldn't you be reading something for school?",2
JESS,Why?,2
LUKE,"I don't know. I mean, I know you like reading and since you like reading, you might as well read something you're gonna get graded on so you can get graded on something you like because you like reading.",2
JESS,What are you babbling about?,2
LUKE,I went to see your principal today.,2
JESS,Huh.,2
LUKE,He says you're flunking out. He says you're not showing up for class. He says you stole their baseballs. You stole their baseballs? Why would you do that? What could you possibly need five hundred baseballs for?,2
JESS,Can we talk about this later?,2
LUKE,"Why, you got a big Frisbee heist going down at six? Jess, Mr. Mertin said if you don't start doing better, they're not gonna let you be a senior.",2
JESS,Bummer .,2
LUKE,They're gonna hold you back.,2
JESS,"Well, at least I'll know where my classes are.",2
LUKE,"Jess, this is serious. You're flunking out. You're looking at being in the eleventh grade for the rest of your life. You're gonna be the kid in the back of the room with a beard and a racing form babbling incoherently about Steely Dan.",2
JESS,Steely Dan?,2
LUKE,"The group may change, the freak in the back never does.",2
JESS,I'm going out.,2
LUKE,Don't you wanna go to college?,2
JESS,Don't wait up.,2
LUKE,What do you wanna be when you grow up?,2
JESS,About twenty miles south of wherever you are.,2
LUKE,"You have to think about the future. If you don't get through high school, who's gonna hire you? You're not gonna have any skills.",2
JESS,Stop.,2
LUKE,"How you gonna work, huh? How you gonna eat? How you gonna pay rent? What are you gonna do, Jess?",2
JESS,,2
LORELAI,Marshmallow?,2
RORY,Thank you.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, I have now finished going through every single one of these movies. I've read them, reviewed their merits, and I'm proud to announce that I have chosen our movie. How does The Yearling sound to you?",2
RORY,Perfect.,2
LORELAI,And buh-bye.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, that must be Pauline Kale rising from the dead.",2
RORY,Tell her hey.,2
LORELAI,Pauline!,2
LUKE,What?,2
LORELAI,Never mind. What are you doing here?,2
LUKE,"Uh, I made some brownies, I thought you might like some.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, gee, since I just ate half a bag of marshmallows, six Pop Tarts, four bagel dogs and a really stale Cheese Nip   yup, it's brownie time, thanks. Hey, here's a question for you.",2
LUKE,Yeah?,2
LORELAI,"Well, you probably have a diner full of people who would love these brownies   plus, I bet they'd pay you for them.",2
LUKE,"Well, I accidentally dropped triple the amount of cocoa powder in the batter so I either had to dump the batch or find someone with some sort of superhuman chocolate tolerance   only one name came to mind.",2
LORELAI,"God, I love being special. What?",2
LUKE,"Nothing. I just. . .hey, uh, is Rory here by any chance?",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, she's in her room.",2
LUKE,Can I talk to her for a sec?,2
LORELAI,"Sure, go right ahead.",2
LUKE,"Hey, thanks. Rory, it's Luke. Can I come in for a minute?",2
RORY,"Hey, what's up?",2
LUKE,Not much. Can I . . .,2
RORY,"Uh, yeah, come on in.",2
LUKE,So I see you're studying.,2
RORY,Yup.,2
LUKE,"That's good. Studying is very, very good. What you're doing right there with the books, very good.",2
RORY,Thank you.,2
LUKE,"Okay, look, I wanted to ask you a favor. Oh. Uh. I was wondering if you could tutor Jess.",2
RORY,What?,2
LUKE,He's not doing too well in school. The principal said he's not gonna let him move on unless something changes. I was wondering if you could help.,2
RORY,"That doesn't make any sense, he's smart enough to pass any subject.",2
LUKE,"I don't think it's his lack of smarts, more like his lack of proximity to the actual classes that's the problem.",2
RORY,Ah.,2
LUKE,Yes.,2
RORY,"Okay, what subject does he need help in?",2
LUKE,"I'd say all of them, probably.",2
RORY,Huh.,2
LUKE,"Look, I don't expect you to work miracles and it doesn't have to be a full time everyday thing. If you could just get him through a couple of his next tests, maybe make the school see that he can do it, that would probably help out a lot.",2
RORY,Sure.,2
LUKE,"Great, tonight?",2
RORY,Tonight.,2
LUKE,"I really appreciate this. Ah, okay, you should get back to your studying, otherwise you're completely useless to me. Okay, so I'll see you guys at dinner probably.",2
LORELAI,"Wait, hold on   what was that all about?",2
LUKE,"Oh, Rory's gonna tutor Jess.",2
LORELAI,She is?,2
LUKE,"Yeah, just for a little while, help get him on the right track.",2
LORELAI,Wow.,2
LUKE,"Okay, I should be getting back. Enjoy the brownies, I'll see if I can screw up a cake for you later on.",2
LORELAI,Sounds great.,2
LORELAI,Hm.,2
LORELAI,"Hey Luke, hang on just a sec.",2
LUKE,Yeah?,2
LORELAI,"Um, listen, about Rory doing this tutoring thing.",2
LUKE,"I really appreciate it, by the way.",2
LORELAI,"I know you do. I just. . .Rory's so sweet and she would never say no to anyone  cause sheloves to help, but I'm not sure if it's the best idea.",2
LUKE,Why not?,2
LORELAI,"Well, she's got her own studies to worry about.",2
LUKE,"I know, and I promise this is not gonna take up all her time. It's just for a little while.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, but - .",2
LUKE,"Plus, Rory's pretty serious about school. I don't think she'd say she had the time if she didn't.",2
LORELAI,"I know, Rory is a great student, but she's just a kid. Don't you need like a professional tutor to help with Jess? You know, somebody with a degree and a pipe and one of those coats with the elbow patches on it?",2
LUKE,"I need someone Jess is gonna listen to, someone he's gonna. . .I don't know, look up to. That sure isn't me an d it sure isn't some tutor. He likes Rory and Rory's on the path that I'd like to see Jess on   school and college. He needs to see somebody he respects doing what he should be doing and Rory's the only person I can think of who fits that description.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, but you don't know for sure that he'll listen to Rory.",2
LUKE,"No, but I gotta do something, don't I? I mean, what would you do if you were me?",2
LORELAI,"Nuh. Okay, just make sure it's not too much time, okay?",2
LUKE,I will.,2
LORELAI,Okay.,2
LUKE,Enjoy the brownie.,2
LORELAI,Mm.,2

LORELAI,I'll give you two because you scare me.,2
KIRK,I hear through the grapevine that you are the one in charge of selecting the movie for this year's movie night?,2
LORELAI,"Yes, I am.",2
KIRK,"Okay, well, I don't know if you know this about me, but I have great creative ambitions.",2
LORELAI,"I did not know that about you, Kirk.",2
KIRK,"It's true. Don't get me w rong, I love the blue collar work. I enjoy the plight of the every man. But as much as the mail letter delivered and the DSL line installed and the latest J. Lo flick rented fills me w ith a deep sense of pride, in my soul I am Akira Kurosawa.",2

LORELAI,"Well, uh, what kind of movie is it?",2
KIRK,"Oh, you mean is it blue? No, perfectly PG.",2
LORELAI,Uh huh.,2
KIRK,"It's not exactly Babe, it's more like Babe 2.",2
LORELAI,Got it.,2
KIRK,"Same pig, harder edge.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, Kirk, I hear you. I wanna help you. Let me think about it and I'll get back to you.",2
KIRK,"Here's a copy of the film. Take a look and call me. And remember, I can edit out two of the hells but I need to keep all the damns. It's a street cred thing.",2
LORELAI,Bye Kirk.,2
LORELAI,"Well, at least now I have something fun to do tonight.",2
RORY,You're not watching that without me.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, I'll wait. So, um. . .ooh, do you wanna get some pie?",2
RORY,"No, I'm full.",2
LORELAI,Coffee? How  bout some coffee?,2
RORY,I'm good.,2
LORELAI,Hot chocolate?,2

RORY,"Bye. Um, Mom?",2

LORELAI,I thought you said this was nothing.,2
RORY,It is nothing.,2
LORELAI,That you guys were just studying.,2
RORY,We are.,2
LORELAI,Then how come I have to lie to Dean?,2
RORY,"Well, you know as well as I do that it's not gonna be okay with Dean if I'm studying with Jess.",2
LORELAI,"Then maybe you shouldn't be. I mean, if you feel weird enough about it that I have to lie to Dean.",2
RORY,I'm not asking you to lie to Dean.,2
LORELAI,You told me to tell him that you're with Lane.,2
RORY,"Well, that was just because   .",2
LORELAI,I don't see Lane here   sounds like a lie to me.,2

RORY,What?,2
JESS,I'm sick of studying.,2

RORY,"Stop! Take it back. Okay, you are taking this wheel back and when you do, I'm going to k*ll you. I'm just letting you know that.",2
JESS,I appreciate the warning.,2
RORY,Jess!,2
JESS,"Okay, I got it. Geez, you look pale. Are you okay?",2
RORY,"Death, and it's going to be painful.",2
JESS,You're not gonna k*ll me. Think how dull your life would be without me.,2
RORY,Serious question?,2
JESS,Okay.,2
RORY,"You know you're smarter than most everybody at your school. It takes you like five minutes to finish a book. You read everything, you remember everything, you could ace those classes easily. Why don't you? You don't need a tutor. It's crazy that they're talking about leaving you back.",2
JESS,Whatever.,2
RORY,"You can do anything you wanted, you can be anything you wanted.",2
JESS,Rory.,2
RORY,I. . .is it like a cool thing?,2
JESS,I could care less about being cool.,2
RORY,"Well, inform me, please.",2
JESS,"I'm never going to college, why waste the time in high school?",2
RORY,And why aren't you going to college?,2
JESS,Please.,2
RORY,What? Please what   why is it so crazy?,2
JESS,"Ask my mother, she could give you a couple reasons. Oh, and I'm sure Principal Mertin can chime in with a few good ones. In fact, ask your mother. She doesn't know me all that well but I'm sure she could improvise a few things.",2
RORY,"Do not give me that whole  I'm so misunderstood, Kurt Cobainy' thing. You are way stronger than that and I don't even wanna hear it. You have to go to college.",2
JESS,"No, you have to go to college.",2
RORY,But don't you have any plans?,2
JESS,"Yes, I plan to get out of Stars Hollow.",2
RORY,And go where?,2
JESS,Wherever.,2
RORY,And do what?,2
JESS,Whatever.,2
RORY,"Wherever, whatever.",2
JESS,"I'll live where I live, I'll work when I need money, and I'll see where I end up.",2
RORY,You could do more.,2
JESS,"Oh, here come the pompoms.",2
RORY,"No, no pompoms, just me saying you could do more.",2
JESS,"So, Courtney, what about you?",2
RORY,What about me?,2
JESS,What are your big ambitions?,2
RORY,Harvard.,2
JESS,And after Harvard?,2
RORY,I'm gonna be a journalist.,2
JESS,Paula Zahn?,2
RORY,Christiane Amapour,2
JESS,You're gonna be an overseas correspondent?,2
RORY,"Yes, I am.",2
JESS,You're gonna crawl around in trenches and stand on top of buildings and have bombs going off in the background and some w ars raging all around you?,2
RORY,"What, you don't think I can do it?",2
JESS,"No, I do. Just sounds a little too   .",2
RORY,A little what?,2
JESS,Just sounds a little too rough for you.,2
RORY,"Well, it's not a little too rough for me. I hope it's not a little too rough for me, I've been talking about this forever. I mean, I don't even know what I would do if   .",2
JESS,"Hey, I didn't mean to freak you out. I'm sorry. I'm sure you'll do it. You will, I promise. I'll help you practice, okay? Tomorrow, you'll stand in the middle of the street and I will drive straight at you screaming in a foreign language.",2
RORY,"Well, you're gonna have to learn a foreign language first.",2
JESS,"Well, it's lucky I've got me a t utor, isn't it? Okay, so I guess we should be getting back. I did promise to study if you went on this ice cream run with me.",2
RORY,"Yes, you did.",2
JESS,"Okay, so I just go straight and we'll be back at Luke's.",2
RORY,Good sense of direction.,2
JESS,"Of course, I could turn right and then we'd just be driving around in circles for awhile.",2
RORY,Turn right.,2
JESS,,2
LORELAI,Hello?,2
RORY,Mom?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, Rory, great. Tell me, was it the China Ball, the China Doll, or the China Wall that had the really good shrimp balls?",2
RORY,I think it was the China Doll.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, these can go. You'll be so proud of me, I'm organizing the takeout drawer. I'm weeding out all the dogs and I'm putting happy face stickers on the dishes that have been huge successes to make our ordering more efficient. Where are you?",2
RORY,I need you to be calm.,2
LORELAI,Calm about what?,2
RORY,Calm about what I have to tell you.,2
LORELAI,What   where are you?,2
RORY,I'm all right.,2
LORELAI,"Well, of course you're all right   why wouldn't you be all right?",2
RORY,Because. . .I got in an accident.,2
LORELAI,What? What accident? What do you mean you got in an accident?,2
RORY,"Jess and I went for ice cream and we were just driving and it was dark and this dog or cat or possum, I don't know   it was small and furry, and it ran out into the middle of the road and Jess swerved and   .",2
LORELAI,Jess swerved?,2
RORY,Yes.,2
LORELAI,Jess was driving?,2
RORY,Yes.,2
LORELAI,Jess was driving your car and you got in an accident?,2
RORY,"But I'm fine and he's fine and the furry thing is fine. The car's a little messed up, but there's nothing for you to be worried about.",2
LORELAI,Where are you?,2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,"Um, hi, hi, excuse me, uh, my daughter's here, she was in a car accident. Her name is Rory Gilmore.",2
NURSE,"Okay, just take a seat.",2
LORELAI,I don't wanna take a seat.,2
NURSE,It'll be one minute.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, do you rememb er in Terms of Endearment, that scene where Shirley MacLaine is in the hospital and freaks out because they won't give her daughter a shot? She got that from me and she toned it down a little. So, once again, I'm looking for my daughter, Rory Gilmore?",2
NURSE,First door on your left.,2
LORELAI,Thank you.,2
LORELAI,"Rory, good. Are you okay?",2
RORY,I'm fine.,2
LORELAI,Oh.,2
RORY,Please tell her that I'm fine.,2
DOCTORory,She's fine.,2
LORELAI,"Well, then, what's with the wrapping?",2
DOCTORory,Well - .,2
LORELAI,"If she's fine, there'd be no wrapping. There's no wrapping if she's fine.",2
DOCTORory,Her arm hit the dashboard. She sustained a minor hairline fracture to her wrist.,2
LORELAI,So she broke her wrist?,2
RORY,"No, it's just a fracture.",2
LORELAI,"Honey, let George Clooney talk here, okay?",2
DOCTORory,"It's a tiny fracture, absolutely nothing serious. I'm gonna put a cast on it. She'll wear it for a couple weeks, that's it.",2
LORELAI,A cast?,2
RORY,"It barely hurts, I swear.",2
LORELAI,"And that's it   just the wrist, everything else is fine?",2
DOCTORory,She seems perfectly healthy.,2
LORELAI,She seems healthy? Did you check everything out?,2
DOCTORory,"Well, we checked almost everything that could've been affected, yes.",2
LORELAI,Almost everything?,2
DOCTORory,"Miss Gilmore, I assure you, we were very thorough.",2
LORELAI,"I'm sure you were, I just would like some extra thorough. Uh, anything that could've possibly, in any scenario, affected this body, I want it checked out.",2
DOCTORory,I'll run a few more x-rays if that'll make you feel better.,2
LORELAI,"It will, thank you.",2
DOCTORory,"And then we'll put the cast on her, so it's gonna be a little while before she's out of here.",2
LORELAI,I can wait.,2
DOCTORory,"Okay. Rory, I'll be right back. You sit still for a minute, okay?",2
RORY,Okay.,2
LORELAI,Aw.,2
RORY,The car's not so good.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, nobody cares about the car.",2
RORY,Jess made sure that he called the ambulance and that I was okay before he even talked to the police and   .,2
LORELAI,"Let's just hear about the details later, okay? I just want you to relax now.",2
RORY,You're not mad?,2
LORELAI,"No, I'm not mad. So they, they uh, brought you in the ambulance?",2
RORY,Yeah.,2
LORELAI,Did they use the siren?,2
RORY,Yeah.,2
LORELAI,I hope Taylor was in bed already.,2
RORY,It was after nine so there's a good chance he was.,2
LORELAI,Nice.,2
DOCTORory,"Okay, Rory, I'm gonna have the nurse take you down to x-ray now.",2
RORY,Okay.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, can I go with her?",2
DOCTORory,"I'm sorry, you have to wait outside. It'll be about an hour if you wanna go grab some coffee or something.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, thanks. Smile pretty for the camera.",2
RORY,Okay.,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,Luke! Luke!,2
LUKE,"Hey, I was   .",2
LORELAI,Where is he?,2
LUKE,Who?,2
LORELAI,"Jess! Where's Jess, Luke?",2
LUKE,"I don't know, I just got back. What's going on? I got here and they weren't here.",2
LORELAI,Jess!,2
LUKE,"Hey, talk to me!",2
LORELAI,"Jess, answer me right now!",2
LUKE,"What's wrong, what happened?",2
LORELAI,There was an accident.,2
LUKE,What - what accident?,2
LORELAI,Jess!,2
LUKE,What accident?,2
LORELAI,Jess was driving Rory's car and he crashed it.,2
LUKE,"What, when?",2
LORELAI,"What do you mean, when? Tonight, tonight   he crashed it tonight! Jess, dammit!",2
LUKE,What happened? Is anyone hurt? Lorelai!,2
LUKE,"Hey, I'm talking to you here.",2
LORELAI,Where would he be? Where would he go?,2
LUKE,I asked you if anyone was hurt?,2
LORELAI,"Uh, was anyone hurt? Well, let's see. Uh, Rory's in the emergency room now with a fractured wrist, so yeah, I'd say someone was hurt.",2
LUKE,Rory fractured her wrist?,2
LORELAI,"Yes, she has to wear a cast for two weeks, she's getting x-rays and tests.",2
LUKE,What about Jess   is he hurt?,2
LORELAI,"No, Luke   Jess did the hurting. That little punk nephew of yours almost k*lled my kid tonight.",2
LUKE,"Look, I'm sure it was an accident. Accidents happen.",2
LORELAI,"Not with my kid in the car, they don't.",2
LUKE,"Okay, you just need to calm down.",2
LORELAI,Why did you do this?,2
LUKE,What are you talking about? Why did I do what?,2
LORELAI,Why did you bring him here?,2
LUKE,What?,2
LORELAI,"If you hadn't brought him here, none of this would've happened.",2
LUKE,This is my fault?,2
LORELAI,"Yes, it is your fault! You told him to come, you let him stay. Everybody hated him,everybody knew he was trouble but you wouldn't listen and you wouldn't send him home and now my daughter is in the hospital!",2
LORELAI,"You kept pushing them together. You asked her to help him study, you knew she'd never say no. I told you it made me nervous, I told you I didn't like it and I should've stopped it right there. But you thought Rory would be good for Jess, never mind what he'd be for her. That wasn't important at all, was it?",2
LUKE,Of course it was important.,2
LORELAI,Why didn't you put a stop to it at the first sign of trouble? Why didn't you make him leave?,2
LUKE,"He's my nephew. I had an obligation to take him in, I had an obligation to care for him.",2
LORELAI,You had an obligation to this town and to me and to Rory. Where are you going?,2
LUKE,I have to find out where Jess is.,2
LORELAI,"Well, I'll tell you where he's not   he's not in the emergency room having him arm plastered up!",2
LUKE,"Hey, I am sorry about Rory. You know I care more about her than I do myself, but at least you know where Rory is and at least you know that she's okay. Now, I have to find Jess and I have to make sure that he's okay, and if that cuts into your screaming time, well that's just too damn bad!",2
LORELAI,Go to hell!,2
LUKE,Right back at ya!,2
LORELAI,,2
JESS,I made sure she was okay.,2
LUKE,,2
LORELAI,"Okay, you've got your TV, you've got your books, your magazines, your refreshments, you have your CD player, your assorted CDs. Stan Freberg, Ash, you have your Sinead O'Connor   because when life really gets you down, Sinead's really the one to teach you some perspective. You have a pad of paper in case you decide to write the great American novel. And over here you have a tiny but annoying bell in case there's something here that you need but you don't have and you want to summon the common but lovely house wench who will promptly leave her talking mice and come to fetch the Contessa whatever she may require.",2
RORY,I think what Contessa requires right now is sleep.,2
LORELAI,Is your arm hurting you?,2
RORY,"Unh uh, but the stuff they gave me at the hospital made me a little dopey.",2
LORELAI,My little Marianne Faithful. Scooch down now and go to sleep.,2
RORY,What are you doing?,2
LORELAI,"Just a little feng shui, go to sleep.",2
RORY,"Mom, you don't have to sleep in here tonight.",2
LORELAI,"I know, I just think the chair looks nice here.",2
RORY,And what's the blanket for?,2
LORELAI,In case the chair gets cold.,2
RORY,And the pillow?,2
LORELAI,To keep the blanket company.,2
RORY,Uh huh.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, everything's in its place. Chair seems warm, blanket seems happy, just one thing missing. . .oh, yeah. Goodnight.",2
RORY,Freak of sideshow proportions.,2
LORELAI,"I love you, too.",2
RORY,Mom?,2
LORELAI,Hmm?,2
RORY,I'm sorry.,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,Chris?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,What? Lor. . . is everything. . .,2
LORELAI,Shh. Come on.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, what are you doing here?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Uh, I have a really crappy mattress at home.",2
LORELAI,Chris.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,I drove here as fast as I could and I went to the hospital but you guys had already left so I tried your cell phone but all I got was the voice mail so I came here but the place looked dark so I got the key out of the turtle and came in but you guys were already asleep so I just grabbed a chair and. . . and apparently my evil plan worked exactly as I anticipated.,2
LORELAI,I'm so glad you're here.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Me too. How's she doing?,2
LORELAI,She's in a cast.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,I know.,2
LORELAI,"The doctor said she'll be fine, he'll take it off in a couple of weeks. The car is totally gone and I have to call the insurance guy tomorrow and. . .I don't know.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Did you find that kid?,2
LORELAI,Jess?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Jess, dead meat, whatever his name is.",2
LORELAI,"No, the little ferret's hiding out somewhere, I'm sure.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Okay, well, I'm gonna deal with the car tomorrow and I still wanna talk to the doctor, if that's okay, and I'm gonna need a picture of this Jess so I don't accidentally rip the head off the wrong kid  cause that would be bad.",2
LORELAI,Look at you all springin' into action.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"About time, don't ya think?",2
LORELAI,I like the superhero you.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Just trying to keep up.,2
LORELAI,"So, are you staying here tonight or do you have to rush back?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"No, I wanna spend some time with Rory tomorrow.",2
LORELAI,And Sherry's cool with you staying here?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Rory comes first.,2
LORELAI,Okay. Do you want some coffee?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,I'll get it.,2
LORELAI,Do you know how to make coffee?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Yes, I do.",2
LORELAI,My coffee?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"One bag of coffee per cup of water, right?",2
LORELAI,"Perfect. Oh my God. When Rory called me tonight and said the word hospital, I just legitimately thought I was having a heart attack, and let me tell you, it was not fun. I'm joining a gym tomorrow, that's how not fun it was.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,See if you can get a two for one membership.,2
LORELAI,Anything could've happened. It could've been so much worse.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,But it wasn't.,2
LORELAI,"No, it wasn't, but it could've been.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"It wasn't. It's okay, everything's gonna be okay.",2
LORELAI,"Hey, about the fight we had the last time you were here. . .",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Oh, yes, that was a doozy, wasn't it?",2
LORELAI,"I just, I didn't mean to. . .",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"No, I shouldn't have. . .",2
LORELAI,"No, but if I implied that. . .",2
CHRISTOPHERory,You didn't. . .I just snapped. . .,2
LORELAI,I understand.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,I'm sorry.,2
LORELAI,"Me too. Hey, did I mention I'm really glad you're here?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,I believe you did.,2
LORELAI,,2
CHRISTOPHERory,The Yearling?,2
LORELAI,Uh huh.,2
RORY,Great movie.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Boy, you think they could've gotten the genius in charge of this to come up withsomething other than The Yearling.",2
LORELAI,"You know, picking a movie that will appeal to a large group of people is hard.",2
LANE,Rory!,2
CHRISTOPHERory,We'll get seats.,2
LANE,"Oh my God! Let me see. Oh, that sucks, that so sucks. Does it hurt?",2
RORY,Only when I rememb er how I got it.,2
LANE,Okay. Here   angry girl for an angry arm.,2

RORY,"Oh, Lane, it was horrible. I have never been involved in anything so horrible in my life.",2

LANE,How bad?,2
RORY,Bad.,2
LANE,Have you talked to Dean?,2
RORY,"No, he gets home tomorrow.",2

LANE,Wow.,2
RORY,"Yeah, everyone is so upset right now. And my dad's in town and something happened between Mom and Luke and she won't tell me w hat. I don't know, they just need time to cool off and then everything will be fine. Everyone just needs time. Maybe I'll try to call him tomorrow.",2
LANE,"Tomorrow. Oh yeah, that's plenty of time. No one will still be mad then.",2
RORY,Sarcasm does not become you.,2
LANE,"Maybe not, but it does sustain me.",2
LORELAI,"Hey, why isn't Jackson here?",2
SOOKIE,"Oh, he's singing to his persimmons tonight. They've been a little sour lately.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, right.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Right? You just accept that explanation?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, why shouldn't I?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Because she just told you the man isn't here because he's singing to fruit.,2
LORELAI,That's better than dancing with it. Remember last year's watermelon crop?,2
SOOKIE,"Oh, yeah   threw his back out.",2
LORELAI,Mm hmm.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,I'm facing the screen now.,2
SOOKIE,The movie's already starting? I thought it started at eight.,2

SOOKIE,"Great, I'll be back.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,This town is like one big outpatient mental institution.,2
LORELAI,Glad you could join us.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Yeah, me too.",2
LORELAI,"It's so nice you decided to stay for the movie. I mean, it's really fun being able to say,  hey, look, I know that person. I talk to him everyday and so far, he's never bitten me.'",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"That's it, I'm definitely coming around more often. You need protection.",2
LORELAI,Coming around more sounds good.,2

LORELAI,"No, it isn't. And even if it is, it'll go away. Everything'll be fine.",2
KIRK,,2
LORELAI,Why are we standing here?,2
RORY,Because the sign says  wait to be seated'.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, but we're not automatons, we are rule breakers, and there are like fifty open tables.",2
RORY,You're exaggerating.,2
LORELAI,"One, two, three, four, fifty   no I'm not.",2
RORY,I'm sure someone will help us soon.,2
LORELAI,"We should be eating, I'm hungry, this is crazy. Don't they want us eating? Isn't that what the point of The Hungry Diner is   to feed the hungry diner? Or is the point of The Hungry Diner to keep the hungry diner hungry, in which case they should call it The Eternally Hungry Diner  cause you're not gonna get any food here, loser.",2
RORY,That would be quite a sign.,2
LORELAI,"Ugh, I'm giving one of these paper-topped turkey heads three seconds to seat us or I swear, I'm gonna start to just   .",2
WAITRESS,Two?,2
LORELAI,"Yes, please.",2
RORY,You're gonna what?,2
LORELAI,What?,2
RORY,"Well, you said you were gonna do something if somebody didn't help us in three seconds.",2
LORELAI,I did?,2
RORY,"Yes, you did, and then the waitress came over and you never finished saying what you were gonna do.",2
LORELAI,"Honey, we gotta get some food into you, you're imagining things.",2
RORY,What were you gonna do?,2
LORELAI,Shh! You're getting screwy!,2
RORY,Mom.,2
LORELAI,Mom? I'm not your mom. Do you need help little girl?,2
RORY,Oh my God.,2
WAITRESS,How's this?,2
LORELAI,"It's, uh, perfect, thanks.",2
WAITRESS,Can I bring you some coffee to start?,2
LORELAI,To start and finish.,2
WAITRESS,Need a little pick me up?,2
LORELAI,Do I!,2
WAITRESS,Back in a jif!,2
LORELAI,"Okay, when she comes back, we're gonna grab her and hold her down and you tell her really ugly things about the world.",2
RORY,Why don't you get your daughter to help you out with your evil plan?,2
LORELAI,"Okay, now, make nice. Oh, how convenient. They have pictures of all the food in case you've been living in a cave for the last fifty years and you have no idea what a stack of pancakes looks like.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry.",2
WAITRESS,"Yes, Sweetie?",2
LORELAI,What are the tiny cups for?,2
WAITRESS,"They're coffee cups, they're for coffee.",2
LORELAI,"What, are you running out or something?",2
WAITRESS,I'm sorry?,2
LORELAI,"Never mind. Listen, we are very sleepy this morning, so would you happen to have something in a larger size, say a mug, a tureen, a small bowl of some kind?",2
WAITRESS,A coffee bowl?,2
LORELAI,"Yes, a coffee bowl.",2
RORY,"Bring two, please.",2
WAITRESS,"We don't have coffee bowls, I'm sorry.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, well, then would you mind bringing. . .what do you think   two, three?",2
RORY,Three's good.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, three of these cute little cuppy things? Oh, and could you leave the pot in the meantime?",2
LORELAI,"Well, looks like coffee, smells like coffee. . .",2
RORY,The comparison stops there!,2
LORELAI,This sucks.,2
RORY,Just put a lot of stuff in there so you can't taste it.,2
LORELAI,How am I gonna fit my three sugars into Barbie's Malibu dream cup here? It'll be all sugar and no coffee.,2
RORY,You may prefer it that way.,2
LORELAI,"Man. Well, well, well.",2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,"I'll be right back. So, what's new for Fall? I hear the sailor suit is hot, hot, hot.",2
MICHELorelai,What are you doing here?,2
LORELAI,Luke's is closed this morning.,2
MICHELorelai,"By the health inspector, no doubt.",2
LORELAI,"So. . . this is where you have your breakfast, huh?",2
MICHELorelai,"Until this morning, yes.",2
LORELAI,How's the grub?,2
MICHELorelai,"They make an excellent egg white omelet, no oil.",2
LORELAI,Really?,2
MICHELorelai,They use the spray. Can you leave now?,2
LORELAI,How come you never told me about this place?,2
MICHELorelai,Because then you might actually eat here and there would be no corner of my life which would be free of your incessant scrutiny. What are you doing with the fork?,2
LORELAI,Can I have a bite?,2
MICHELorelai,Can you what?,2
LORELAI,Just a taste.,2
MICHELorelai,Get away from me.,2
LORELAI,"Aw, Michel, don't go. Come eat with us.",2
MICHELorelai,"You'd like that, wouldn't you?",2
LORELAI,"No, not really.",2
MICHELorelai,"Good, it's a date.",2
LORELAI,"You, me, here tomorrow?",2
MICHELorelai,Never.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, know what? I'm beginning to like this place.",2
RORY,"I'm glad. Mom, I need to ask you a favor.",2
LORELAI,Ask away.,2
RORY,I need you to get me out of dinner tonight.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, Rory.",2
RORY,Dean's coming home an d he doesn't know about the accident and if I'm not there the second he gets home then someone else is gonna tell him about it and then that would be   .,2
LORELAI,Horrible.,2
RORY,Yes.,2
LORELAI,I agree.,2
RORY,I really hate to ask you this.,2
LORELAI,"Ah, forget about it.",2
RORY,Really?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, absolutely. Make things right with Dean.",2
RORY,I really appreciate this.,2
LORELAI,"No problem. In fact, it gives me a little extra time to work on my  why Rory's wearing a cast' story for your grandparents.",2
RORY,Yeah? What do you got so far?,2
LORELAI,Really big bees.,2
RORY,"Huh. Well, it's good you've got the time.",2
LORELAI,,2
EMILY,I'm so sorry Rory isn't feeling well. Is it that flu that's been going around?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, yes, it is.",2
EMILY,Horrible strain. Bunny Carlington-Munchausen has been bedridden for two straight weeks.,2
LORELAI,"Huh. Well, it must wipe her out just toting that name around.",2
EMILY,I wonder if I should take a drink into Richard. I hate to disturb him while he's working.,2
LORELAI,"He's working, like work working?",2
EMILY,"That's right. His articles of incorporation arrived last week. He's rented an office. Your father is now the president and CEO of the Gilmore Group, an international insurance consulting firm.",2
LORELAI,"Wow, that's great. So, um, what's the. . .like, how does. . . what's his job?",2
EMILY,He's a consultant.,2
LORELAI,Meaning?,2
EMILY,Your father is an international insurance consultant.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, yeah, but what exactly does that mean?",2
EMILY,He consults on matters relating to international insurance.,2
LORELAI,"Wait, wait   when Dad goes to his new office, he sits down and he. . .",2
EMILY,Consults with international clients on insurance matters.,2
LORELAI,I don't know why we're not opening for Rickles.,2
RICHARD,Dammit !,2
EMILY,"Richard, are you all right?",2
RICHARD,"No, I am not all right. That was Margie just now on the phone.",2
EMILY,"Oh, how is she?",2
LORELAI,Who is she?,2
EMILY,You know very well who Margie is. She's been your father's secretary since you were a child.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, Largie Margie. . .very clever when you're six.",2
RICHARD,"In answer to your question Emily, Margie is well. So well, in fact, that she has decided not to join me in my new business.",2
EMILY,What?,2
RICHARD,She's staying with the old firm.,2
EMILY,But how could she? You were the only reason she even had a job at that firm.,2
RICHARD,I went to great pains to remind her of just that.,2
EMILY,"Well, this is simply unacceptable. You and that rotund ingrate had an agreement.",2
LORELAI,"There was an agreement, in writing?",2
RICHARD,"Well, not in writing per se, but she helped me procure my new office, she arranged to have all my things sent over, all that was left was for her to accept my formal offer, a very generous one, if I may say so.",2
EMILY,And she just turned you down?,2
RICHARD,She had the gall to counteroffer. She kept insisting that I match her current salary.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, Dad, you weren't even offering to match the poor woman's salary?",2
RICHARD,"Well, Lorelai, the Gilmore Group is a fledgling enterprise. I can't afford to pay Margie her full salary right away.",2
EMILY,"But after twenty years, where is the woman's sense of loyalty?",2
LORELAI,"Oh, gee, I don't know. . .maybe with the company that's keeping her from having to stand in line for government cheese.",2
RICHARD,"I'm afraid, at this point, I don't know how to proceed.",2
EMILY,"Well, of course you don't.",2
RICHARD,I had counted on this.,2
EMILY,Of course you had.,2
RICHARD,Perhaps I should reconsider going forward.,2
EMILY,That may be best.,2
LORELAI,Excuse me?,2
RICHARD,I can't very well do it without Margie.,2
EMILY,No one would expect you to.,2
LORELAI,"Guys, you can't be serious.",2
EMILY,I wonder if it's too late to get out of my lease.,2
LORELAI,What?,2
EMILY,"You should look into that immed iately, Richard.",2
LORELAI,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! There is a baby here desperately in need of some bath water.",2
RICHARD,What is she saying Emily?,2
EMILY,What are you saying Lorelai?,2
LORELAI,I'm just saying there are other options to consider.,2
RICHARD,Like what?,2
LORELAI,Like hire another secretary.,2
EMILY,Oh no. Your father's had other secretaries.,2
RICHARD,"Three in fact, each one worse than the previous one.",2
EMILY,Until Margie.,2
RICHARD,Margie was a gem.,2
EMILY,Margie did everything for him.,2
LORELAI,"Yes, but Dad, there are plenty of other Margie's out there dying to be in that kind of codependent relationship with you. You will find one, trust me. Now she might not be named Margie but if you pay her enough you can probably call her whatever you want.",2
RICHARD,"I don't have time to find someone new. The office is a disaster. Everything is in boxes. I don't know where anything is or how anything works. . . the computers, the phones, even my office chair.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, Dad, I'll tell you what. Tomorrow afternoon after my business class, I will come to your office and we'll get you unpacked, we'll get you settled, and we'll find you someone as good as Margie, or at least cheaper.",2
RICHARD,"Oh, I hate to see you waste your time.",2
LORELAI,"Well, I'll blindfold you then.",2
RICHARD,"I don't know, I   .",2
LORELAI,"Dad, there's another Margie out there, honest. Just give it a chance.",2
RICHARD,An office without Margie. . .,2
EMILY,Seems inconceivable.,2
LORELAI,,2
DEAN,Hey.,2
RORY,Hey. DEAN'S,2
DAD,Hi Rory.,2
DEAN,What happened? What'd you do to your arm?,2
RORY,Here.,2
DEAN,What is this?,2
RORY,Just read it.,2
DEAN,"What   Rory, what's going on? Tell me how you hurt your arm.",2
RORY,It's all in the letter.,2
DEAN,But   .,2
RORY,Read.,2
DEAN,"Uh. . . Well, I love you, too.",2
RORY,Good   now just hold onto that feeling for a minute.,2
DEAN,Why?,2
RORY,Just   .,2
DEAN,"Read, all right, I'm reading. What?",2
RORY,Keep going.,2
DEAN,What?,2
RORY,Turn it over.,2
DEAN,What!,2
RORY,"Go on, you have like three more whats ahead of you.",2
RORY,It gets better at the end. I'll just stand here until you get there.,2
DEAN,Is he really gone?,2
RORY,Yes.,2
DEAN,Okay. You wanna come in ?,2
RORY,What?,2
DEAN,"You can stay for dinner, my mom's making a roast. You like roast, right?",2
RORY,"Um, yeah, I like roast.",2
DEAN,,2
RORY,And then we just watched TV.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, you mean you  watched TV.' Use the air quotes, Sweetie.",2
RORY,His little sister was there.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, so you watched TV. . .go on.",2
RORY,And then he walked me home.,2
LORELAI,That's it?,2
RORY,That's it.,2
LORELAI,Did he kiss you goodnight?,2
RORY,Yup.,2
LORELAI,But he didn't ask about the other night at all?,2
RORY,Nope.,2
LORELAI,Didn't ask about the car?,2
RORY,Not once.,2
LORELAI,And Jess?,2
RORY,He just asked if he was really gone and that was it.,2
LORELAI,Wow.,2
RORY,"I thought he would yell and scream. I though he would wanna break up   instead, he gave me his corn.",2
LORELAI,He did? When?,2
RORY,At dinner.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, so you were already eating. It wasn't just an out of the blue,  And I give you my corn.' Okay, got it.",2
RORY,"Maybe it just hasn't sunk in yet, maybe he'll be mad tomorrow.",2
LORELAI,Maybe Dean is even more terrific than we thought he was.,2
RORY,It's not covering the whole cast.,2
LORELAI,"Relax, I'm not done.",2
RORY,Do you really think he's okay with it?,2
LORELAI,Sounds like it.,2
RORY,"If the situation were reversed, I don't think I'd be okay with it.",2
LORELAI,"If the situation was reversed, I don't think Dean would've let Jess drive his car.",2
RORY,I guess I should just be grateful then?,2
LORELAI,"Grateful, absolutely.",2
RORY,What are these?,2
LORELAI,These are resumes for your Grandpa's new secretary.,2
RORY,There are like a hundred of them.,2
LORELAI,"Yes, well, the world is full of eager young people just waiting to have the life sucked out of them by Richard Gilmore. Okay, I'm finished   what do you think of that?",2
RORY,"If we were gazelles, we'd be the first ones eaten at the watering hole.",2
LORELAI,"Well, be thankful we're not gazelles. Now go take your shower. You're starting to look like you're starring in an independent film.",2
LORELAI,Hey?,2
RORY,Yeah?,2
LORELAI,"Dean knows ya, hon. He knows you wouldn't do anything to hurt him, he gets it. So, you're lucky, just focus on that. Jess is gone, now you guys can start over.",2
RORY,Okay.,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,Dad?,2
RICHARD,"Oh, come in , come in .",2
LORELAI,"So, let me guess, the Wu Tang Clan had the office before you?",2
RICHARD,"Yeah, it's a bit disheveled, I know.",2
LORELAI,"Wow, it's freezing in here.",2
RICHARD,"Uh, yes, it has been since I moved in.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, did you try adjusting the thermostat?",2
RICHARD,"Yes, that only seemed to make it angry.",2
LORELAI,"So you've been just Nanooking it this whole time, just sending out for whale blubber and mukluks?",2
RICHARD,"Well, I wouldn't touch that if I were you, Lorelai. You don't know what you're do  .",2
LORELAI,"Ah, the wind done gone.",2
RICHARD,"So it would seem, for the moment.",2
LORELAI,"No, no, I turned it off. Here, let me show you. Do you wanna get that?",2
RICHARD,"No, no, they've already hung up.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, next time hold an envelope up to your head before you do that.",2
RICHARD,"Well, it's been doing it all day. The phone rings once, and then poof, they're gone.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, that's because your messages are being forwarded to your voice mail. See where it says voice mail.",2
RICHARD,How could that happen?,2
LORELAI,"I don't know, where's your manual?",2
RICHARD,"Uh, manual. . manual. . .",2
LORELAI,"Uh, came w ith the phone, probably has a picture of a phone on it. Aha, look what I found under your copper ball glued to the wood thing here.",2
RICHARD,"Uh, it's brass. One of the firm's parting gifts as they nudged me into retirement.",2
LORELAI,"So, in addition to being heavy and ugly, it's also insulting.",2
RICHARD,Quite.,2
LORELAI,"There you go, that should work. You wanna call me from your office?",2
RICHARD,"Well, this is my office.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, well, whose office is that?",2
RICHARD,"Ah, yes, excellent idea. That isn't me calling.",2
LORELAI,Didn't think so. Should I get that?,2
RICHARD,"Yes, please.",2
LORELAI,"Um, hello, the Gilmore Group. Mr. Hensen. . . why, yes, he...",2
RICHARD,Ooh!,2
LORELAI,"...just walked out. May I take a message? Uh huh. . . Um, how are you spelling, uh, Larry? Oh, traditionally, great. Okay, uh, thank you for calling. . .bye bye. Where the hell are your pens?",2
RICHARD,"Uh, watch your language, young lady. What did Larry want?",2
LORELAI,He wanted to know where the hell your pens are.,2
RICHARD,Lorelai.,2
LORELAI,"He just wants you to call him, Dad. Where are all the office supplies?",2
RICHARD,"Well, I haven't gotten around to that yet.",2
LORELAI,"Before anything else can happen, you need pens, you need paper, you need. . . everything else, don't you? Especially since I might be tempted to wash my hand at some point.",2
RICHARD,"Well, where does one get these things?",2
LORELAI,"Well, Dad, where did you used to get them?",2
RICHARD,From Margie.,2
LORELAI,,2
RICHARD,"Good Lord, this place goes on forever.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, it goes on until chair mats and floor mats but if you're not careful, you'll loop back around into inks and toners and be here all day. Stay close. Hey, there's a seat in the cart if you want a ride.",2
RICHARD,"I'll pass. Look at the scale of this place. I mean, no one needs all these options, it's oppressive. Hundreds of paper clips in every conceivable color and size. Now, who on Earth would buy these things?",2
LORELAI,"We would. All right, now, what's the first thing you do when you get to the office in the morning?",2
RICHARD,"Uh, well, let's see, I return the calls from Asia first.",2
LORELAI,"That's right, you make coffee, so you'll need a coffee maker. Let's see. Ugly, crappy, German, ooh - pretty!",2
RICHARD,"Oh, well, as long as it's pretty.",2
LORELAI,Why is everything worth having just out of reach?,2
RICHARD,Is there no one here whose job it is to actually assist paying customers?,2
LORELAI,"No, that's how they can afford to sell this baby for forty percent off.",2
RICHARD,"Forty percent off, I had no idea.",2
LORELAI,"Nicely done, Dad. You won't be sorry.",2
RICHARD,"You know, it's suddenly becoming clear to me that I'm an old man. I don't recognize half the whats-its and dodads in here.",2
LORELAI,"Well, Dad, here we have an assortment of magic sticks and when you press down on paper, writing comes out.",2
RICHARD,"I know what pens are, Lorelai.",2
LORELAI,"Good, you pick out your favorites and I'll try to figure out how to explain Liquid Paper to you.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, you're cute.",2
RICHARD,I can't possibly use all of those.,2
LORELAI,"You won't. You'll lose half of them, then you'll be really happy to have the ones you have left. Now, paper.",2
RICHARD,All right. This oughta do nicely for now.,2
LORELAI,"What, are you going into business for two weeks? You are building an empire for crying out loud. Think big, Gilmore! Plus, if you get the box, it's cheaper.",2
RICHARD,"Say, how do you happen to know all of this?",2
LORELAI,"It's how we do it at the inn. You have to spend money to make money, my friend. It's a little tip from me t o you.",2
RICHARD,Good point. What else?,2
LORELAI,I'd strongly recommen d a stapler.,2
RICHARD,Stapler.,2
LORELAI,Some ext ra staples.,2
RICHARD,"Ah, I'm way ahead of you.",2
LORELAI,Good man. Post-Its.,2
RICHARD,"My goodness, look at all the Post-Its. I had no idea they came in so many shapes and colors. I'm gonna get a twelve pack for myself in various hues.",2
LORELAI,Wise move.,2
RICHARD,And one for Emily. I have seen her post notes on her vanity mirror to remind her of various activities.,2
LORELAI,"Ah, she'll think it's Christmas.",2
RICHARD,"Done. Now, what else is on the hit parade?",2
LORELAI,"Well, it might be controversial, but I was thinking of something in the way of a three-hole punch if we can find one.",2
RICHARD,,2
LANE,Dawn Powell? I've never heard of her.,2
RORY,"Nobody has, which is a shame because she wrote sixteen amazing novels, nine plays, and there are some w ho actually claim that it was Powell who made the jokes that Dorothy Parker got credit for.",2
LANE,Blasphemy.,2
RORY,"I know. I'm trying not to hold it against Dawn though, until I have proof that she was involved with the whole smear campaign.",2
LANE,"Hey, look! They finally took the boards off the windows.",2
RORY,"Oh, I wonder what it's going to be.",2
LANE,I don't know.,2
RORY,What's that in the corner?,2
LANE,"I think it's. . .a bass. It's a bass! And look, there are guitars on the wall! Oh my God, it's a music shop!",2
RORY,"Wow, that is much better than the ceramic circus store we thought was going in there.",2
LANE,I can't believe it. Stars Hollow has taken its first steps toward being cool. I wonder how soon it's going to open.,2
RORY,"If you keep pushing on the glass like that, much sooner than anticipated. Hey, hold on a sec?",2
LANE,"Why, what's wrong?",2
RORY,"Nothing, I'll be right back. Taylor?",2
TAYLORory,"Rory, hello!",2
RORY,"Hi. Listen, I just wanted to   .",2
TAYLORory,"Oh no, just look at that arm!",2
RORY,"It's fine, really.",2
TAYLORory,Does it hurt?,2
RORY,"No, not much.",2
TAYLORory,"Well, I hope you're not getting addicted to painkillers like those Hollywood people do.",2
RORY,"Um, I'm not, don't worry.",2
TAYLORory,"Good, because pain is your body's way of saying  I'm not okay now, but I will be soon.'",2
RORY,I will rememb er that.,2
TAYLORory,You don't wanna shut your body up too soon. That's called death.,2
RORY,"Right. Um, Taylor, listen, I just wanted to apologize to you.",2
TAYLORory,About what?,2
RORY,"About the other night. You know, my car hit the bench that had your brand new Doose's Market sign on it and I know how much that sign meant to you and I'm just so, so sorry that it was ruined.",2
TAYLORory,"Oh, well, it wasn't your fault.",2
RORY,But my car hit the bench.,2
TAYLORory,Your car hit the bench because that Jess was driving.,2
RORY,"Oh, well, yeah, but   .",2
TAYLORory,"That boy is a walking natural disaster, they should name a tornado after him.",2
RORY,"But he didn't cause it Taylor, there was  ",2
TAYLORory,"Rory, you don't have to explain a thing to me. I know that there is absolutely no way that you would be involved in something like that if it weren't for that Sal Mineo wannabe, believe me. Chachi, and Chachi alone, will be held responsible for that incident, okay? Good. Now take a peach.",2
RORY,Thanks.,2
LANE,"So, is he mad?",2
RORY,"No, not at me.",2

KIRK,"I am licensed to carry a g*n, if that'll help.",2
SOPHIE,You have no idea how much.,2
SOPHIE,Can I help you?,2
LANE,"Oh, no thank you. I was just looking.",2
SOPHIE,"We like the looking, it's the touching we're a little iffy on.",2
LANE,"Actually, I was just going. . . That probably would've been construed as touching, huh?",2
SOPHIE,Yes.,2
LANE,Right. Oh my.,2
SOPHIE,That's a DW drum set with Zildjian cymbals.,2
LANE,It's beautiful,2
SOPHIE,Do you play?,2

RICHARD,"Ah, yes, here it is. Let's see. Uh, the highest contributions in absolute terms were reached in the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Netherlands. Uh huh. Well, yes, I would have to look up those specific coding and reference numbers. Uh huh, yes, I've got them right here. Mm hmm. For the year, uh, 2001. . . uh, here they are. Uh, yes, are you interested in the Netherlands? I think that's a market that's gonna go through the roof.",2
LORELAI,"Gilmore Group, may I help you? Oh, no, Margie doesn't work for the company anymore. I'm the one who called to schedule the DSL appointment. Well, no, no, we really need the DSL line installed today, it's just awful being without it. Uh huh. Okay, well, um, if you can make it before five, everything's good, but any later than that won't work because the cable modem people are dropping by about 5:05, so. . . well, thank you, that's great. Okay, bye bye. They'll be here in twenty minutes.",2

LORELAI,"The secretarial candidates for tomorrow's interviews. I've looked through them pretty carefully, and I think somewhere in there is a Margie for the new millennium.",2
RICHARD,I'll get it.,2
LORELAI,"No, get to know your new secretary, I don't mind. Gilmore Group, may I help you?",2
EMILY,"Yes, Richard Gilmore, please.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, um, uh, certainly, may I ask who's calling?",2
EMILY,Emily Gilmore.,2
LORELAI,And does he know what this is about?,2
EMILY,"Well, I hope so, I'm his wife.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, but Richard didn't say anything about being married.",2
EMILY,What!,2
LORELAI,"Mom, relax, it's me.",2
EMILY,Lorelai?,2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
EMILY,"Well, you're crude and unprofessional.",2
LORELAI,"Well, I'd like that on my tombstone, please. Now what can I do for you?",2
EMILY,"I'm throwing a little cocktail party at the office on Friday to help launch the new business. Now, the caterers will be arriving at three o'clock sharp to set up, so   are you writing this down? You should be writing this down.",2
LORELAI,I'm scribbling furiously.,2
EMILY,Margie always wrote everything down.,2
LORELAI,So does this mean no Friday night dinner?,2
EMILY,It means we'll see you both at the party.,2
LORELAI,,2
BABETTE,"Oh! Rory, Sweetie, hold on there, baby!",2
RORY,Hey Babette. Is everything okay?,2
BABETTE,"I should be asking you that question. Come here, let me see that arm. Oh, you poor little thing. How you doing, huh?",2
RORY,I'm doing fine.,2
BABETTE,"Aw, look at ya, being brave like that after all you've been through. Geez, it's so hard being a woman, isn't it?",2
RORY,I guess.,2
BABETTE,"I mean, you've got your morals and your standards and your good common sense and then bam! You meet some guy and all that goes right out the window.",2
RORY,But   .,2
BABETTE,"For every good woman there's a dirty little wolf just ready to lead her astray. You can't help it, he's got the eyes, the chin, the chest hair you could carpet your dining room with. . .I mean, what's a woman to do? We're not made of steel for God's sake.",2
RORY,Babette  ,2
BABETTE,"I was in a cult once, did I tell you that?",2
RORY,No.,2
BABETTE,"I met this guy once   gorgeous, tan, looked just like Mickey Holiday. We had coffee, he gave me a p amphlet. Next thing you know, I'm wearing a muumuu, playing a tambourine, jumping up and down at the airport.",2
RORY,"Okay, I really have to get inside.",2
BABETTE,,2
RORY,"Mom, you here?",2
LORELAI,"Hey you, it's me. I'm gonna be home a little late today   still trying to find Grandpa a Margie. So order pizza, money's under the rabbi, hope your arm's feeling okay, Sweets. Buh-bye.",2
RORY,Hello?,2
LANE,I have found my calling.,2
RORY,What are you talking about?,2
LANE,"I am talking about my future, my path, my destiny, my thing, my scene, my bag. I'm talking about the number one item on my cosmic to-do list.",2
RORY,Which is?,2
LANE,I'm gonna be a drummer !,2
RORY,You're kidding.,2
LANE,"I went into that new music store today -- I don't know why I went in, I just had to. Something told me,  Lane Kim, there's something in there that you need to see', and there it was, and it was red and shiny and I'm so excited I can't breathe.",2
RORY,That's amazing.,2
LANE,I know.,2
RORY,But how are you gonna do this?,2
LANE,I don't know.,2
RORY,How are you gonna buy a drum set?,2
LANE,I don't know.,2
RORY,"And even if you do buy a drum set, where are you gonna play it?",2
LANE,,2
KAREN,"So when she opened her own office, she asked me to come along as her executive assistant and office manager, which was a terrific opportunity.",2
LORELAI,I bet! How so?,2
KAREN,In that I was able to build that office and its staff from the ground up and develop a system from scratch.,2
LORELAI,"Wow, so you have a system.",2
KAREN,"Which helped double productivity and billing hours, but then she got pregnant, and well, here we are.",2
LORELAI,"Wow, story of my life   literally.",2
RICHARD,"Well, uh, thank you for coming in, uh. . .uh, Karen. Uh, we'll let you know once we make our decision.",2
KAREN,"Thank you, Mr. Gilmore. It was a pleasure meeting you both.",2
LORELAI,"Here, I'll walk you out. I love what's going on with your shoes, by the way. Hey, look what I found.",2
RICHARD,"Oh, good, lunch, I'm starving. Uh, do you wanna eat in here today?",2
LORELAI,"Sure, why not?",2
RICHARD,"Oh, good, they threw in pickles like I asked. It's great having this place just across the street, isn't it?",2
LORELAI,You'll never starve.,2
RICHARD,"Hm, maybe we should start a tab with them so we don't have to pay cash everyday.",2
LORELAI,Already done.,2
RICHARD,"Amazing. You're like the tiny fellow on that Mash program, always anticipating.",2
LORELAI,"So, what do we think?",2
RICHARD,"Mm, that's tasty.",2
LORELAI,"No, I mean about Karen.",2
RICHARD,Who?,2
LORELAI,"Karen, the woman who was just here, the one with the system.",2
RICHARD,"Mm, rather inexperienced, I thought.",2
LORELAI,"Dad, she worked as an executive assistant for six years.",2
RICHARD,"Well, she's young, and young women tend to be flighty.",2
LORELAI,She worked for the same w oman for five of those six years.,2
RICHARD,"This roast beef is delicious. It's lean, it's tender. What'd you get?",2
LORELAI,Cheeseburger.,2
RICHARD,"Mm, I may get one of those myself if we order from the same place tomorrow.",2
LORELAI,Tomorrow?,2
RICHARD,Mm hmm.,2
LORELAI,You mean for more secretary interviews?,2
RICHARD,"Well, whatever's on the agenda.",2
LORELAI,"Dad, you've already seen like three people who would be absolutely perfect for the job.",2
RICHARD,"You can't rush these things, Lorelai. A man's secretary sets the tone for the entire enterprise.",2
LORELAI,"I know that, but  ",2
RICHARD,"It has to do with chemistry as much as anything else, which cannot be manufactured out of sheer necessity. Besides, you and I seem to be doing just fine for the moment.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, for the moment, but the moment is coming to a rapid end.",2
RICHARD,"Well, what do you mean?",2
LORELAI,I can't work here  cause I have my own job.,2
RICHARD,"I know that, Lorelai.",2
LORELAI,"And I need you to find an assistant soon, like now because I don't even know when I'm gonna be able to come back.",2
RICHARD,"Well, I need to see more resumes. In the meantime,  ",2
LORELAI,"Dad, I cannot come back here tomorrow.",2
RICHARD,I see.,2
LORELAI,I didn't mean that to sound so harsh. I just. . .I meant  ,2
RICHARD,"I know exactly what you meant to say, Lorelai. I got the message. Well, I won't keep you any longer, I know how busy you are.",2
LORELAI,"Dad, I didn't mean I have to go right now. We can finish our lunch.",2
RICHARD,"Oh, I'm finished. Will you leave the phone number of the sandwich shop for me, please? I'll need it.",2
LORELAI,All the numbers you need are right there on your desk.,2
RICHARD,"Oh, good. Now, if you will excuse me, I have some of my own work to attend to. Thank you for all your help.",2
LORELAI,"You know, Dad, if it makes any difference, I thought that Karen was  ",2
RICHARD,,2
LORELAI,Here.,2
RORY,"You know, there will be food there.",2
LORELAI,"Finger food, aka snooty little balls of attitude.",2
RORY,Oh boy.,2
LORELAI,"I need real food, peasant food. Hearty bread, meat, cheese, a little pickle chips, a sauce, a special sauce. This is the food that sustains me, this is the food of my  ",2
RORY,"Oh my God, just eat the burger already!",2
LORELAI,How crabby.,2
RORY,I'm not crabby.,2
LORELAI,I didn't even get through my special sauce speech. That's crabby.,2
RORY,Sorry.,2
LORELAI,Does your arm hurt?,2
RORY,"No, I'm just tired, I guess.",2
LORELAI,"All right. We won't stay very long. Just long enough to get five or six withering stares from my dad, and be taken down three or four notches by my mother, then we're outta there. Ugh.",2
RORY,Not good?,2
LORELAI,"Really not good! I swear, Luke better come back soon or I'm gonna starve to death.",2
RORY,I'm sorry.,2
LORELAI,For what?,2
RORY,Luke's gone because of me.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, honey, he is not.",2
RORY,"Yes, he is. I got into an accident and then you guys had a fight.",2
LORELAI,"Rory, it isn't your fault. If it's anyone's fault. . .",2
RORY,It's Jess' fault.,2
LORELAI,"Well, yes.",2
RORY,Why does everyone in this town think that it is all Jess' fault?,2
LORELAI,"Hey, let's not talk about this, okay?",2
RORY,"I was there too, you know.",2
LORELAI,"Rory, everyone here loves you. They know you're not the  get in an accident and knock over a bench' girl.",2
RORY,"I know that, and I appreciate that, but  ",2
LORELAI,"I want you to stop beating yourself up about this. It's over, Jess is gone. Let's forget about this, okay, please?",2
RORY,Fine.,2
LORELAI,"Good. Hey, hand me that burger again.",2
RORY,I thought you said it was bad.,2
LORELAI,,2
LORELAI,Oh geez. This is worse than the clowns in the Volkswagen.,2
RORY,A lot of people.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, do you want something to drink? I think we're three martinis behind everyone else.",2
RORY,"Just water, I guess.",2
LORELAI,"Coming up. Oh boy, I should've brought bread crumbs. Excuse me.",2
EMILY,"Lorelai, there you are. You're late.",2
LORELAI,"Well, you scheduled this beer bash during rush hour.",2
EMILY,When traffic is leaving Hartford.,2
LORELAI,Apparently not when Emily Gilmore is throwing a party.,2
EMILY,"It's wonderful, isn't it? Everyone showing up for your father.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, Mom, but don't you ever think about scaling back a little?",2
EMILY,"I scaled back a lot. I cut two appetizers, I canceled the champagne fountain, and I reduced the catering staff to six servers, not counting the pointman.",2
LORELAI,"Well, you can't not have a pointman  cause then what's the point?",2
EMILY,"If you make it look cheap, people will think you're unsuccessful.",2
LORELAI,Absolutely right. Better to deprive them of oxygen so they don't have to think at all.,2
EMILY,"It is rather warm in here, isn't it?",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, do you want me to get the air going?",2
EMILY,"No, no, Karen knows how to do it.",2
LORELAI,Karen?,2
EMILY,"Your father's new secretary. She's wonderful, very professional. Karen, darling, would you mind turning on the air conditioning?",2
RICHARD,"No, I'll have Karen draw up the contracts today. That'll be in the morning.",2
LORELAI,Hi Dad.,2
RICHARD,Lorelai.,2
LORELAI,Swell party.,2
RICHARD,"Uh, yes, it's mostly your mother's doing.",2
LORELAI,"So, um, what just went down there?",2
RICHARD,Down where?,2
LORELAI,"Just now, the handshake with the man in the gray flannel suit   did you score a deal?",2
RICHARD,"Well, one doesn't score deals in the insurance business, Lorelai. One builds relationships based on trust and fulfilling the client's needs.",2
LORELAI,Sorry.,2
RICHARD,"Mr. Lundquist and I, uh, just were -",2
LORELAI,"Uh, Mr. Lundquist?",2
RICHARD,Yes.,2
LORELAI,Lundquist from Aero International?,2
RICHARD,Yes.,2
LORELAI,You bagged the Swede?,2
RICHARD,"Well, just as I didn't score the deal, I also haven't bagged the Swede. We simply talked, we came to an agreement, we shook hands.",2
LORELAI,"You shook hands, that means  ",2
RICHARD,I'm sending him the contracts in the morning.,2
LORELAI,"Dad, that's big!",2
RICHARD,"Yes, I suppose it is big.",2
LORELAI,"That's gigantic! It's a whole new market for you. It opens up all of Scandinavia, doesn't it?",2
RICHARD,Beyond that. Lundquist is his company's rep for Russia as well.,2
LORELAI,Russia!,2
RICHARD,Da!,2
LORELAI,Look who's taking over the world.,2
RICHARD,I suppose that would be me.,2
LORELAI,I see that you hired Karen.,2
RICHARD,"Uh, yes, well, I had to get someone in here.",2
LORELAI,She seems to be working out well.,2
RICHARD,"Well, she's no. . .Margie, but we'll see. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have several more deals to score now that I have finished bagging the Swede.",2
LORELAI,"He's really in his element, isn't it?",2
EMILY,"And happier than he's been in years. Oh, there's Rory. I was wondering where she's   what's that on her arm?",2
LORELAI,"Oh, I was gonna tell you about that.",2
RORY,Hi Grandma.,2
LORELAI,That is a cast. She hurt her arm.,2
EMILY,When? How bad is it?,2
RORY,I fractured my wrist.,2
EMILY,Oh my God.,2
LORELAI,It's just a hairline fracture. . .it's just tiny.,2
EMILY,When did this happen?,2
LORELAI,"Um, last week.",2
EMILY,"Last week? Why didn't you call me? Last week, I can't believe you.",2
LORELAI,"Um, well, I meant to.",2
EMILY,How did this happen?,2
LORELAI,Bees.,2
RORY,I got in a car accident.,2
EMILY,What?,2
LORELAI,Rory.,2
RORY,I got in a car accident.,2
EMILY,"Oh my God, how could you not tell us that she got into a car accident? Is this why she missed dinner? You said she had the flu.",2
LORELAI,"I just didn't want you to worry, Mom.",2
EMILY,"Yes, well, clearly there was nothing to worry about. It was that car, wasn't it? The one her boyfriend made. Richard was dead set against letting her drive that death mobile.",2
LORELAI,"No, it wasn't the car, Mom.",2
EMILY,"Well, then what was it?",2
RORY,A friend of mine and I went to get ice cream,2
EMILY,A friend? Which friend   Lane?,2
RORY,Jess.,2
EMILY,Jess?,2
RORY,Luke's nephew.,2
EMILY,Him? I thought you were going to keep that boy away from her.,2
LORELAI,"Mom, do we have to talk about this now?",2
EMILY,"Yes, we have to talk about this now. The child has a cast on her arm. I don't understand howyou could've been so irresponsible.",2
LORELAI,"Mom, please.",2
EMILY,"Don't  Mom, please' me. It was your responsibility to stop this, it was your responsibility to make sure that he did not  ",2
RORY,"I gave him the keys. I told him to drive. He wanted to drive back to Luke's and I said no. I wanted to keep on driving and that's when we got into the car accident. This is just as much my fault as it is his, maybe more.",2
EMILY,Rory.,2
LORELAI,"I've got this, Mom. Can I see you in the hall for a second? Hey, what the hell was that?",2
RORY,I'm sick of this. I'm sick of everyone treating me like I'm some kind of mindless idiot being led around by a guy.,2
LORELAI,No one is treating you like that.,2
RORY,"Everyone is, the whole town is. . . Taylor, Babette, Dean. Everyone in my life, including you, is refusing to believe that I was just as responsible for what happened that night as Jess was.",2
LORELAI,Really? Were you driving the car?,2
RORY,No.,2
LORELAI,Then you weren't as responsible.,2
RORY,"What if it'd been Dean, huh? What if Dean had been driving? Would everyone be assuming that it was his fault?",2
LORELAI,"No, because if Dean had been driving there wouldn't have been an accident because Dean is a much more responsible kid who loves you and would've been driving more responsibly.",2
RORY,How do you know that Jess wasn't?,2
LORELAI,Hi. . .it's Jess.,2
RORY,"Oh, right, Jess is the antichrist, I forgot. He wanted to get into an accident. He was looking for something to hit because he's a m*rder*r with a death wish and he wanted to k*ll us both, right?",2
LORELAI,"I know you think that Jess is your friend, but he's not. He is a completely out of control, really angry kid who has no respect for Luke, who has no respect for me. . .",2
RORY,It was an accident!,2
LORELAI,And he was driving!,2
RORY,"So, what, no matter what I say, you're just gonna choose to blame Jess?",2
LORELAI,"Yes, I choose to blame Jess.",2
RORY,Just because you hate him?,2
LORELAI,"That's right! I'm sorry, but when my daughter comes home broken I get to hate the guy who broke her. That's how it works. He's gone, I win. You are wearing a cast and I get to hate him forever!",2
RORY,Fine!,2
LORELAI,Fine!,2
RORY,Fine!,2
LORELAI,"I just had this image of thirty-five businessmen, six servers, one pointman all leaning up against that wall with glasses to their ears.",2
RORY,I don't think they needed the glasses.,2
LORELAI,"We've got good lungs, you and I.",2
RORY,We're never gonna agree on this.,2
LORELAI,You have to understand -,2
RORY,I do.,2
LORELAI,Okay.,2
RORY,I don't wanna fight about this anymore.,2
LORELAI,Neither do I. Do you wanna go back inside?,2
RORY,"No, I wanna go home. My wrist hurts and I'm grumpy and I just made a total idiot of myself in there so I just wanna go home.",2
LORELAI,"All right, well, I'll tell Mom, I'll drive you.",2
RORY,"No, it's okay. It's still early. I can catch my regular bus and. . .you go back in.",2
LORELAI,Rory.,2
RORY,I just want some al one time now.,2
LORELAI,Are you sure?,2
RORY,,2
SOPHIE,"It's after six, we're closed.",2
LANE,Five more minutes?,2
SOPHIE,"Nope, now.",2
LANE,"So, you're from New York, huh?",2
SOPHIE,"Yes, I am.",2
LANE,I wanna go to New York someday.,2
SOPHIE,Good for you.,2
LANE,Did you like it there?,2
SOPHIE,It was all right.,2
LANE,What part of New York did you live in?,2
SOPHIE,"Okay, look, what's your name?",2
LANE,Lane Kim.,2
SOPHIE,"Very nice to meet you, Lane Kim. Now you have got to get out of here because I am going to close and you are not going to schmooze me into forgetting that I am going to close.",2
LANE,Wait?,2
SOPHIE,What?,2
LANE,I have to have those drums.,2
SOPHIE,Great   cash or credit?,2
LANE,"No, see, I have no money. Plus, even if I did have money there's no way I could take those home w ith me because my mother would never stop crying, so I have a proposal.",2
SOPHIE,Uh huh.,2
LANE,"Twice a week, on Wednesday and Friday nights at six o'clock, I could come and practice here.",2
SOPHIE,"Wow, that sounds great.",2
LANE,"Now, I'm not expecting you to let me do this for free or anything. I'll clean or do inventory or stock stuff or whatever it is that you need done.",2
SOPHIE,I don't need that much done.,2
LANE,"Well, then, I can do other things also, like, uh. . .oh, hey, do you know Korean?",2
SOPHIE,No.,2
LANE,"Well, then I could teach you.",2
SOPHIE,Why would I wanna learn Korean?,2
LANE,"Why wouldn't you? It's an interesting language, and being bilingual in this day and age can only be a plus.",2
SOPHIE,"Please, go home.",2
LANE,"I can't. I can't go home until you say yes. I have to rock, I have to! Please, I'm so begging you   let me rock!",2
SOPHIE,Why Wednesdays and Fridays?,2
LANE,Because that's when my mom has her Bible group.,2
SOPHIE,"Okay, let's see what you got.",2
LANE,"Really? Oh my God, thank you! Can I hit them this time?",2
SOPHIE,Go ahead.,2
LANE,"Yes! A one, two, three, four!",2
SOPHIE,I'll be in the back in case the cops come.,2

LANE,Where are you guys going?,2
RORY,Mystery breakfast.,2
LANE,Out of town?,2
LORELAI,Does no one rememb er the definition of the word mystery?,2
LANE,"Sorry, I was just wondering if it's okay to practice on your pots and pans again this morning?",2
LORELAI,It's not like they have any other use.,2
LANE,Thanks. I've almost nailed the fill in the Ramble On. I just have to stop hitting my face with the sticks when I pull my arms back.,2

LORELAI,"No, because clearing my head just means that all the knowledge I have painstakingly stuffed in there will leak out. In order to make room for stuff, I lose stuff. It's a very vicious circle.",2
RORY,I'll make some coffee.,2
LORELAI,I hate finals.,2
RORY,Nobody likes finals.,2
LORELAI,Thank God I'm graduating and this is the last time I have to cram like this because my pursuit of higher education has led me to a very interesting discovery about myself. Do you wanna hear it?,2
RORY,Sure.,2
LORELAI,"I despise academics. Yup, learning, knowledge, it's all worthless. I have no idea in what you see in any of it.",2
RORY,"Learning is fun, plus for me there's that whole ""I'm a minor so it's mandatory"" thing.",2
LORELAI,That's what kills me   this is self-inflicted. I'm a masochist. I might as well be carrying a switch and periodically lacerating myself with it.,2
RORY,"That diploma hanging on the wall is going to make this all worthwhile, trust me.",2
LORELAI,"I guess, unless I turn into John Nash and start drooling on people.",2
RORY,"Hey, you're graduating.",2
LORELAI,I know.,2
RORY,"No, you're graduating   there is gonna be a ceremony.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, I don't know. It's community college.",2
RORY,"Well, community colleges have ceremonies.",2
LORELAI,"My community college doesn't even have a lawn, they won't necessarily have a ceremony",2
RORY,They must. Did you ask?,2
LORELAI,"No. Well, now that you mention it, I think someone said something about some cheesy ceremony for my business class.",2
RORY,When is it?,2
LORELAI,I don't know. . .next Thursday or something.,2
RORY,"That's great, you have to do it.",2
LORELAI,I don't know.,2
RORY,You have to do it.,2
LORELAI,Really?,2
RORY,Yes. You've never been apart of an actual graduation ceremony.,2
LORELAI,I know. That's because my stupid conservative high school wouldn't let me be in the ceremony and nurse you at the same time.,2
RORY,Don't be gross.,2
LORELAI,Do you really think I should do it?,2
RORY,"Yes! You've worked hard for this, you've earned it.",2
LORELAI,I guess.,2
RORY,"Come on, you know that deep down you really want to do this.",2
LORELAI,"Well, I'll admit, I've always wanted to wear one of those gowns.",2
RORY,And the hat?,2
LORELAI,For the tassel  cause you know my thing for fringe.,2
RORY,And they call out your name an d people clap and you get your diploma.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, and then you do that thing where you move the tassel from one side to the other   very symbolic, very dramatic.",2
RORY,"That's it, you're doing it.",2
LORELAI,"All right, if you insist.",2
RORY,"Okay, who do you wanna invite?",2
LORELAI,"I don't know, you.",2
RORY,And?,2
LORELAI,That's cool with me.,2
RORY,Sookie and Jackson?,2
LORELAI,"Aw, that'll be fun.",2
RORY,Okay. And Grandma and Grandpa?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, no. No no no.",2
RORY,"Come on, it's your graduation. They should be there.",2
LORELAI,Forget it.,2
RORY,But --,2
LORELAI,They won't want to be there.,2
RORY,Of course they will.,2
LORELAI,"Rory, I was supposed to graduate from high school. Go to Vassar. Marry a Yale man and get myself a proper nickname like Babe or Bunny or Shih Tzu.",2
RORY,Yes but --,2
LORELAI,"Instead, I got pregnant. I didn't finish high school, I didn't marry your father and I ended up in a career that apparently Jessica Hahn would think was beneath her.",2
RORY,That's not - .,2
LORELAI,I humiliated them. The two proudest people in the world and I humiliated them. I spoiled their plans. I took their fine upbringing in a world of comfort and opportunity and I threw it in their faces. I broke their hearts and they'll never forgive me. I guess I can't expect them to.,2
RORY,Maybe you're wrong about how they feel about all this. It was a long time ago.,2
LORELAI,"Rory, I don't want them to go. It'll just hurt them. . .and me, okay?",2
RORY,Okay. You should get back to your studying.,2
LORELAI,"Fine. Oh, great.",2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,I think I've already forgotten everything I read in the last two hours.,2
RORY,"No, you haven't.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, I have. In fact, I may have forgotten everything that I've ever known. Child, what be your name?",2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,Just explain the concept one more time.,2
DEAN,"And be mocked again? No, thank you.",2
RORY,Come on.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, maybe we're missing something.",2
DEAN,"Okay, you go to a special sh**ting range  ",2
RORY,A skeet sh**ting range.,2
DEAN,"Right. There's two of you and the guy with the g*n yells ""Pull!"" and then the other guy releases a clay pigeon from a machine into the air and so you try to sh**t it.",2
LORELAI,"No, I don't think we're missing anything.",2
DEAN,"Yeah, I knew it.",2
RORY,You sh**t pigeons?,2
DEAN,Clay pigeons.,2
LORELAI,"When you hit them, does blood come out?",2
DEAN,They're clay.,2
RORY,And why do you like to do this?,2
DEAN,I don't know. My dad shot skeet when he was my age and so he wants to pass the tradition down.,2
LORELAI,What if you accidentally hit a real pigeon?,2
RORY,"Yeah, does that count?",2
DEAN,That's never happened.,2
LORELAI,"What if a clay pigeon hits a real pigeon, does that count?",2
RORY,"Yeah, does that count?",2
DEAN,I've only done this once.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, if you get really good, do you move on to other animals like clay chickens and clay sheep?",2
DEAN,"You know, we didn't go skeet sh**ting, I just made it all up.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, hey, I gotta go in here.",2
RORY,"Oh, what do you need?",2
LORELAI,Just general stuff. You guys go and be in love.,2
RORY,I'll see you back at the house.,2
DEAN,Bye.,2
RORY,,2
LUKE,Oh.,2
LORELAI,Dah.,2
LUKE,Sorry.,2
LORELAI,"No, no, I should have signaled or honked or something, my fault.",2
LUKE,Okay.,2
LORELAI,"Well, um, I guess it was inevitable us running into each other. It's a very tiny community.",2
LUKE,Guess so.,2
LORELAI,How's the diner?,2
LUKE,It's still there.,2
LORELAI,"Yes, I knew that. I'm able to empirically with my eyes, uh. . .Hey Luke, do you think we could  ",2
LUKE,I gotta get back.,2
LORELAI,,2
EMILY,I'll get it.,2
RORY,Hi Grandma.,2
EMILY,Hello Rory.,2
RORY,Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.,2
EMILY,"I'm thrilled to see you on no notice. So, tell me, what's this about? You were so mysterious on the phone.",2
RORY,I just wanted to talk to you about something in person.,2
EMILY,"Well, come in , come in .",2
RORY,Wow.,2
EMILY,"It's an English tea service. One the advantages of our having an English maid. That, and the fact that she speaks English.",2
RORY,You didn't have to do this.,2
EMILY,"But it's tea time an d I wanted to. . .oh no! Beatrice, I told you to doily line the plates!",2
RORY,You don't have to doily line the plates.,2
RICHARD,Hello?,2
EMILY,We're in the dining room.,2
RICHARD,"Oh, oh, Rory, you're already here.",2
RORY,You're out of breath.,2
RICHARD,I ran over from the office.,2
RORY,"Oh, you didn't have to run.",2
RICHARD,"Well, your grandmother said you had something to discuss with us. That certainly justifies a run.",2
EMILY,"All right, everybody, sit, sit. Pour the tea, Beatrice.",2
RORY,"Um, actually, Beatrice, could you hold off on pouring the tea for just a minute? Thank you very much. Grandma, Grandpa, I would like to propose an idea to you. Now, you can go for it or not, it's entirely up to you, but I would like for you to promise me that you will not get upset.",2
EMILY,We won't get upset.,2
RORY,And that you will try to keep an open mind.,2
EMILY,All right.,2
RORY,And that you will let me finish my presentation completely before you respond.,2
EMILY,She's been hanging around you far too much.,2
RICHARD,"Rory, we accept your terms. Please proceed.",2
RORY,"Thank you. First, let me start by saying that Mom doesn't know that I'm here. She'd probably be pretty mad if she knew that I was, but I feel that this is important. As you know, Mom's been going to business school at the community college out here for three years now.",2
EMILY,I believe she's mentioned it.,2
RORY,"Well, she's doing very well and she's finishing up. Actually, she's graduating Thursday, and there's going to be a ceremony and I think it would mean a lot to her if you guys were there. It may not seem like it would, but it's true.",2
EMILY,"Well, if it would mean so much to her then why didn't she invite us herself?",2
RORY,"Because she didn't think you'd wanna go. And I get that, but I think it's a mistake. I had a school thing once, and I wasn't sure if Mom would want to go so I didn't invite her. It was mykindergarten ""Salute to Vegetables"" pageant and I was broccoli and I did a tap dance with a guy that was playing beets and the entire number I was just thinking, ""Mom's not here"" and it was my fault that she wasn't there and, well, it was kind of a life lesson for me. Now, if the thought of going to Mom's graduation upsets you or makes you unhappy or uncomfortable in any way, then, please, don't go because this is an important night for Mom and if you go, you should go under the right circumstances. Those are the tickets. It's Thursday, 7pm. It's indoors so weather's not an issue. You can use them or not, no hard feelings, do what you feel is best. And if you don't mind, I would really appreciate it if you would keep this conversation between the three of us. That's all I have to say, thanks very much for your patience. Now, I believe I have time for a scone before my bus leaves.",2
EMILY,"Beatrice, the tea, please.",2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,"I am feeling so good, sista, because it's over! No more finals, no more studying, no more school, the pressure's off. Do you know how much pressure I felt, do you? All last week I felt like a giant man and his brother were sitting on my chest.",2
RORY,A giant man?,2
LORELAI,And his giant brother.,2
RORY,Did they have names?,2
LORELAI,"Clem and Clem. Huh, same names, which did not reflect well on the imagination of their mothers.",2
RORY,Mother.,2
LORELAI,Mothers. There were two Clems.,2
RORY,"Yeah,  cause they were brothers.",2
LORELAI,"Yes, so they had mothers.",2
RORY,"Okay, you're drawing me in to your drunken world.",2
LORELAI,"It's not a bad place to be, my friend. Mnh-mnh, t*nk's empty.",2
RORY,"Hey, what is this?",2
LORELAI,What?,2
RORY,"This, uh,  Life Plan' book thing.",2
LORELAI,"A little gift for the grads from the happy people at Hartford Community College. Hey, how many margaritas is too many margaritas?",2
RORY,"Um, if you can't rememb er where the living room is.",2
LORELAI,"Ha ha, I'm still good.",2
RORY,"Okay, here's an interesting question for you   ""Have you given any thought to how children will work into your future plans?""",2
LORELAI,"Oh, well, uh, they're not gonna stand in my way, that's for sure. I mean, I plan to have some, of course, but I'm just gonna knock 'em out and, uh, have Nanny catch 'em and care for 'em, make sure Mick Jagger doesn't come an ywhere near them and then just return them to me when they're twenty-one.",2
RORY,"Well, what about me?",2
LORELAI,"You are my favorite eldest child, you get to stay by my side.",2
RORY,"Oh, I feel so privileged.",2
RORY,I'll get it.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, now, if that's Mick Jagger, hang up and blow that whistle I gave you.",2
RORY,Hello?,2
JESS,Hi. Hello?,2
RORY,Hi.,2
JESS,Is this a bad time?,2
RORY,"Um, no, just hold on a sec? Um, the music. . . uh, I'll be right back. Hi.",2
JESS,You said that already.,2
RORY,"I did. You're right, sorry.",2
JESS,"So, what's up?",2
RORY,Nothing. What about you?,2
JESS,Same.,2
RORY,"So, what have you been doing?",2
JESS,"Nothin' much. Just hanging out. . . in the park, mostly.",2
RORY,Central Park?,2
JESS,Washington Square Park.,2
RORY,Oh.,2
JESS,It's cooler.,2
RORY,Yes.,2
JESS,It's where David Lee Roth got busted.,2
RORY,"Right, right. I hope he's got it together now.",2
JESS,Sounds like you got a party going on there.,2
RORY,"No, it's just me an d my mom.",2
JESS,"Right. Okay, well, I'm gonna go. This is long distance.",2
RORY,"Yeah, it is long distance.",2
JESS,"So, see ya.",2
RORY,,2
RORY,Mom?,2
LORELAI,Ahh!,2
RORY,What's wrong?,2
LORELAI,I'm experiencing frustration.,2
RORY,At the general state of things in the world or at something particular?,2
LORELAI,What do you wear to a graduation?,2
RORY,Cap and gown.,2
LORELAI,"Duh, I mean underneath.",2
RORY,Whatever you want. The gown will cover it.,2
LORELAI,"It's more complicated than that. I don't want to overdress so that I'm sweating if it's hot in the auditorium but if I don't have enough on and it's cold, then I'll freeze.",2
RORY,"It is complicated, especially if you overthink it.",2
LORELAI,And now I need a helpful comment.,2
RORY,"Take light layers. Wear your turquoise and tan dress that you just got that's cool and it'll look good without your gown on, and wear your turquoise vintagey sweater over it because it'll look great with the dress and it'll keep you warm if it's cold in the auditorium.",2
LORELAI,You are a fashion genius.,2
RORY,"Well, you've taught me ev erything I know.",2
LORELAI,My brain's not working today.,2
RORY,"You're excited, it's a big day.",2
LORELAI,What time ar e you getting there?,2
RORY,"I have a bunch of newspaper stuff after school, but no later than six.",2
LORELAI,And then we'll go out to eat after?,2
RORY,"Any place you want, and it's on me.",2
LORELAI,You don't have to do that.,2
RORY,You're the graduate. You get to be pampered.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, then I would like to go to Chateau Jean Georges la Jean Georges in Paris.",2
RORY,I'll look it up in Zagats and book the Concorde. I gotta go.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, I gotta get ready.",2
RORY,"Wait, wait, I wanna see my little graduate one more time before the big event.",2
LORELAI,What do you think   do I look ready to make my way in the world?,2
RORY,"Yes, and if all else fails, you can marry rich.",2
LORELAI,I love that we always have that option.,2
RORY,"Hey, what are you gonna do with your hair?",2
LORELAI,I got the curling iron warming up.,2
RORY,"Mom, the cap! You put it on, its gonna --",2
BOTH,- smush the curls down.,2
LORELAI,You are a genius.,2
RORY,See you tonight,2
LORELAI,"Hey, try to seat us next to a celebrity on the Concorde, like Sting or Screech or someone.",2
RORY,,2
PARIS,"So I told her, ""Look missy--""",2
RORY,"You called your advisor ""Missy""?",2
PARIS,,2
SOOKIE,Are they closed?,2
LORELAI,They're closed.,2
SOOKIE,Are you sure?,2
LORELAI,I'm sure.,2
SOOKIE,"Okay, one second and open, open, open.",2
LORELAI,"Aw, you made me a t assel hat cake!",2
SOOKIE,Filled with two pounds of crushed chocolate-covered espresso beans.,2
LORELAI,You're evil.,2
SOOKIE,And you're graduating.,2
LORELAI,"Yes I am, aren't I?",2
SOOKIE,"Here. Oh, hey, I brought those pictures you wanted to see of my high school graduation.",2
LORELAI,"Hand them over, lady.",2
SOOKIE,"Okay, but don't laugh.",2
LORELAI,I promise.,2
SOOKIE,"I was younger then, not as refined.",2
LORELAI,"Ha, and you're stoned.",2
SOOKIE,Totally.,2
LORELAI,I thought you hated that.,2
SOOKIE,"It was peer pressure. At my school, if Gilbert Garcia offered you a toke, you took it or took off.",2
LORELAI,"Well, I think Gilbert had a snappy slogan.",2
SOOKIE,"Oh, I was nauseous all day.",2
LORELAI,Your parents?,2
SOOKIE,For the traditional parents-flanking-their-graduate shot. Don't they look proud?,2
LORELAI,"They do, very proud.",2
MICHELorelai,What is that?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, it's pictures of Sookie's high school graduation. What was your high school graduation like, Michel?",2
MICHELorelai,"It was dignified, as most French ceremonies are. Poetry was read, a string quartet played, a ballerina performed.",2
LORELAI,You drank some Bo one's Farm out of a boda bag and knocked a beach ball around?,2
MICHELorelai,I don't understand half of what you said.,2
LORELAI,That's why we work.,2
LORELAI,Hello?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Hey, Lor, how you doing?",2
LORELAI,"Christopher. I'm good, I'm excited.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"You should be, it's a big day. Did you get my present?",2
LORELAI,What present?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,A basket. You should've gotten it by now.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, did a basket come for me?",2
MICHELorelai,"Mm, it came, it was heavy, I felt a twinge so I dropped it for health reasons. It's probably still intact.",2
LORELAI,My crack staff has just informed me of its arrival. I'm going to find it. Wow!,2
CHRISTOPHERory,I put it together myself.,2
LORELAI,And it's all for me?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,All for you.,2
LORELAI,Chris. . wow. Ha! A twenty-five dollar savings bond.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"That's a long-term investment. Don't touch it for thirty years, you're looking at forty- five dollars.",2
LORELAI,"Ooh, a youth hostel card.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,For the young girl who doesn't mind sharing a bathroom with fifty strangers.,2
LORELAI,"""What Color Is Your Parachute? A Practical Manual for Job Hunters.""",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Helping you answer the two,2
questions,what do you want to do and where do you want to do it?,2
LORELAI,"A DVD of The Graduate, gotta have that. Ooh, The Portable Nietzsche.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Light, cheery reading.",2
LORELAI,An application to join the Armed Forces.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, if your dreams don't pan out and Nietzsche's no help, it's a viable option.",2
LORELAI,"And something in a nice little velvet box. Ooh, a necklace, and the pearl almost looks real.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, it better look very real, because it is.",2
LORELAI,That's not funny.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,This is not a funny gift.,2
LORELAI,"Christopher, this is extremely not funny. This is totally humorless. It's. . .it's beautiful.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"I think you're awesome, Lor. With everything you do and raising Rory the way you did, you're superwoman.",2
LORELAI,Wow.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Have a great day. I wish I could be there. Take lots of pictures for me.,2
LORELAI,"Ugh, the camera, I forgot the camera.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Look in the basket.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, you thought of everything.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Have a great night.,2
LORELAI,,2

RORY,I feel very urban today.,2
JESS,"Oh yeah, the plaid just screams urban.",2
RORY,I think I look like a native.,2
JESS,How well do you know Manhattan?,2
RORY,I've been here a few times. We saw The Bangles here.,2
JESS,"When was that, twenty years ago?",2
RORY,It was a reunion and they were great.,2
JESS,"Yeah, they're okay.",2
RORY,"And a couple years ago Mom drove us in to shop, and she couldn't find a good parking place and all of the parking lots were a total rip-off, so she kept making U-turns and cutting off taxis and we were being screamed at in so many different languages that we just turned around and drove home an d bought a Hummel at the curio store in Stars Hollow.",2
JESS,How very adventurous.,2
RORY,I'm just saying I'm no stranger to the Big Apple.,2
JESS,You are if you're calling it the Big Apple.,2
RORY,"So I don't have the lingo down yet, but at least I have the attitude.",2
JESS,"You do, huh?",2
RORY,"Oh yeah. When I was getting a locker for my backpack at the bus stop, there was this guy and he was just standing there staring at me and instead of ignoring him I just fixed him with a really withering stare.",2
JESS,That I've got to see.,2
RORY,No.,2
JESS,"Oh, come on, let me see your withering stare.",2
RORY,It's dangerous. I could hurt you.,2
JESS,I've been hurt before.,2
RORY,No.,2
JESS,I'm disappointed. So your arm's okay?,2
RORY,"Yeah, it looks worse than it is.",2
JESS,I like this Emily chick. Friend of yours?,2
RORY,She's a friend to all of us dispossessed.,2
JESS,So here's our lunch place.,2
RORY,A hot dog stand?,2
JESS,"Hey, I eat here everyday. It's nothing fancy, but -",2
RORY,"No, I love it. It's perfect.",2
JESS,Good. One with everything on it.,2
RORY,"Make that two, please.",2
JESS,"So, uh. . .how's -",2
RORY,Luke?,2
JESS,Yeah.,2
RORY,Okay. He went fishing.,2
JESS,Fishing?,2
RORY,Yeah. He didn't catch anything though.,2
JESS,Probably used the wrong bait.,2
RORY,"Yeah, that's a common fishing blunder.",2
JESS,So he's good?,2
RORY,"Yeah, he's good. I can tell him hello for you if you want.",2
JESS,Whatever.,2
RORY,"Thank you. Oh, my God, this is really good!",2
JESS,I'm glad you like it. So how much time you got?,2
RORY,I got a bit.,2
JESS,There's a record store you should check out. It's run by this insane freak who's like a walking encyclopedia for every punk and garage-band record ever made. Catalog numbers. . .it's crazy. The place is right out of High Fidelity.,2
RORY,Let's go.,2
JESS,Okay.,2
RORY,Where you going?,2
JESS,Subway.,2
RORY,I thought we were gonna walk.,2
JESS,"It's fifteen blocks. Come on, I think you'll like it.",2
RORY,Do they allow hot dogs in the subway?,2
JESS,,2
LORELAI,"Excuse me, hi, I'm one of the graduates.",2
MAN,"Wow, you're hours early.",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, well, I just wanted to beat traffic and have time to get ready and relax, and also, I've heard the early bird gets the unwrinkled gowns without the mysterious stains in them.",2
MAN,This is true. Take your pick.,2
LORELAI,Thank you. This is so exciting. Isn't this exciting?,2
MAN,This is my eighth year of doing this.,2
LORELAI,"So, not so exciting for you, got it.",2
LORELAI,Huh.,2
EMILY,You're being so cryptic. Do you need a power source or not?,2
RAULorelai,"Look, my batteries are all fully charged. It just depends on how fast they deplete.",2
EMILY,"So, we need one just in case?",2
LORELAI,Mom.,2
EMILY,"Lorelai, it's hours before the ceremony. What are you doing here?",2
LORELAI,"Um, I'm just getting. . .I'm sorry, what are you doing here? How do you even know about this?",2
EMILY,I shouldn't know about this? A mother can't know about this?,2
LORELAI,"No, I just mean -",2
EMILY,You're graduating.,2
LORELAI,I know.,2
EMILY,"So, we're here to see you graduate. This is Raul.",2
LORELAI,"Hey. So, you and Raul are just here to see me graduate?",2
EMILY,Don't be silly. Your father will be joining me later.,2
LORELAI,My father?,2
EMILY,"Yes, rememb er him? Tall, bow tie.",2
LORELAI,"I rememb er Dad, Mom. I just. . .ah, Rory told you.",2
EMILY,"Yes. That's okay, isn't it? It's a little late if it's not.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, no, it's perfectly fine that you're here, absolutely. I'm just surprised. Who are you?",2
RAULorelai,I'm Rau l.,2
EMILY,I just told you that.,2
LORELAI,"Yes, well, did Rory invite Raul, too?",2
EMILY,Raul is my cameraman.,2
LORELAI,Cameraman?,2
EMILY,"He's going to be filming the ceremony for us. He's very talented. He screened an independent film of his as an audition, ""Welcome to Scab Land."" It was disgusting, but beautifully photographed.",2
RAULorelai,It was supposed to be disgusting.,2
LORELAI,"I'm sure it was. Mom, all this stuff. . .",2
MAN,"Excuse me, all of this equipment, it can't be here.",2
EMILY,"Well, obviously we're not going to leave all of this equipment here for everybody to trip over. We're not cretins.",2
LORELAI,"She's handling it. Right, Mom? You're handling it.",2
RAULorelai,"Okay, this lighting sucks!",2
EMILY,Can we do something about the lighting?,2
MAN,"I don't think so, ma'am. I don't know.",2
EMILY,"It's a community college, we'll just have to cope. Think documentary.",2
LORELAI,"Mom, please. People will be showing up here soon. You can't --",2
EMILY,"Lorelai, I am perfectly capable of handling this. No one will be inconvenienced.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, I'm just gonna let everyone deal with all this because I need to relax and get a cup of coffee and maybe hammer a nail into my head.",2
EMILY,"You're not needed here, Lorelai. Go get your coffee, relax. You're going to redo your makeup later, aren't you?",2
LORELAI,,2
JESS,I haven't even heard of half these bands.,2
RORY,"I love that about this place. God, Lane would wanna live here.",2

RORY,Oh my God!,2
JESS,What?,2
RORY,Look!,2
JESS,Go-go's. You must have that one.,2
RORY,"No, for my mom. This was her favorite group when she was my age, and it's signed by Belinda. This would be the perfect graduation present. I've been looking for something all week long, and I couldn't find anything and now I have Belinda.",2
JESS,Graduation?,2
RORY,"Oh, from college, from business classes.",2
JESS,I'm surprised she has time for anything except lighting darts on fire and throwing them at my picture.,2
RORY,"Well, it's not a lot of time, but . . .",2
JESS,"Uh-huh. Go on, get it. She'll like it.",2
RORY,Thank you so much for bringing me here. This was fate.,2
JESS,"Yes, it was.",2
RORY,"And in return, I just might show you my withering stare.",2
JESS,,2
RORY,I think this one's mine.,2
JESS,"Yup, the sign says Boonesville.",2
TOURIST,"Excuse me, I'm so sorry to bother you. Which way is 44th?",2
RORY,"Oh, um, that way.",2
TOURIST,"Great, thanks.",2
RORY,I got asked directions.,2
JESS,I saw.,2
RORY,He took me for a native. That's so cool.,2
JESS,That's very impressive. 44th's the other way.,2
RORY,Oh no.,2
JESS,Sorry.,2
RORY,"Oh, man, I should go find him.",2
JESS,He'll figure it out when he sees all the numbers getting smaller instead of bigger.,2
RORY,He still thought I was a native. That's cool.,2
JESS,I'm your witness.,2
RORY,"Well, I should go.",2
JESS,Okay.,2
RORY,I gotta go to my mom's graduation.,2
JESS,And give her Belinda.,2
RORY,And give her Belinda.,2
JESS,"Go on. I'll check on the guy, I'll make sure he's not wandering around looking for 44.",2
JESS,Why did you come here?,2
RORY,What?,2
JESS,"I said, why did you come here?",2
RORY,Well -,2
JESS,"I mean, you ditched school and everything. That's so not you. Why'd you do it?",2
RORY,Because you didn't say goodbye.,2
JESS,"Oh. Bye, Rory.",2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,"Great, I'm Woody Allen in Annie Hall.",2
LIZA,You thought ahead. Smart.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, the mirror? Yeah, I never leave home without all the",2
essentials,"mirror, makeup, picture of Shaun Cassidy. I'm done. Do you want to use it?",2
LIZA,"Thanks. Oh, don't I look charming?",2
LORELAI,"Oh, you look great.",2
LIZA,I've looked better. I had to run here straight from work -- Kinko's.,2
ZACH,"Hey, Liza, that gets me thinking   maybe you and I oughta do a little reproducing after the ceremony.",2
LIZA,Clever.,2
ZACH,Don't be a snot.,2
LIZA,"Shut up! That's my boyfriend, Zach.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, sure.",2
LIZA,"Of course, we're breaking up 'cause we're transferring to different schools. He's going to Florida State, I'm going to UMass. . .although I'm kinda going to miss this place.",2
ZACH,I'm not. This place stunk. It's Bush League.,2
LORELAI,Why'd you go here?,2
ZACH,"My parents, wise investors that they are, couldn't afford anything else.",2
LIZA,"Yeah, I guess that two-point-zilch grade point average didn't reason into things.",2
ZACH,Shut up.,2
LIZA,Between the lines.,2
ZACH,Go die.,2
LORELAI,"Are you sure you two don't wanna give it another go, 'cause you're darling together.",2
LIZA,Thanks for the mirror.,2
LORELAI,My pleasure.,2
LIZA,"Hey, a bunch of us are going to Shakey's afterwards for a pizza. You wanna come?",2
LORELAI,"Aw, I'm going out with my daughter after, but it sounds like fun.",2
ZACH,"Okay, you guys are not going to believe this. There's some blue-blooded rich woman out there setting up professional film equipment like she's sh**ting a movie or something.",2
LORELAI,You're kidding.,2
LIZA,Whose mother is it?,2
ZACH,I don't know. Little Precious must be around here somewhere though.,2
LIZA,I hate people with money.,2
ZACH,"So do I, with every fiber of my being.",2
LORELAI,,2
RORY,Excuse me?,2
DRIVERory,Yes?,2
RORY,Are we leaving soon?,2
DRIVERory,I have no idea.,2
RORY,"Well, should you have an idea?",2
DRIVERory,"There was an accident, closed the interstate. All outbound buses were told to stand down.",2
RORY,Oh. And you don't know when we're going to be allowed to stand up again?,2
DRIVERory,"Soon, I hope. I hate missing dinner.",2
RORY,,2
SOOKIE,"There's our little graduate. Oh, my God, look at that gown. You look just like the Statue of Liberty.",2
LORELAI,"Ah, all big and stony?",2
SOOKIE,"No, you look amazing.",2
LORELAI,Hmm. You look very G.Q.,2
JACKSON,"Oh, thanks to my best new friend Ermenegildo Zegna.",2
SOOKIE,Don't you love how he can pronounce it and all?,2
LORELAI,Very Cosmopolitan.,2
SOOKIE,He got it for the rehearsal dinner. It's his first real suit.,2
JACKSON,And not my last. I look hot!,2
LORELAI,Mmm.,2

LORELAI,"Oh, shh!",2
SOOKIE,Why shh?,2
LORELAI,It's a long story. Just do me a f avor?,2
SOOKIE,Sure.,2
LORELAI,"Keep an eye on my parents, make sure they don't disrupt anything, my mother doesn't behead anyone, my father doesn't snore too loudly when he falls asleep.",2
SOOKIE,They're not gonna do anything like that.,2
LORELAI,"I'm sorry, have you not met them?",2
SOOKIE,Why would they come an d do that?,2
LORELAI,They're here because Rory invited them.,2
SOOKIE,No.,2
LORELAI,Yes! They can't say no to that little face. It's like hitting a puppy with a rolled-up newspaper.,2
ZACH,"Hey, you guys are not gonna believe this.",2
LIZA,You're Mr. Announcement Guy today.,2
ZACH,"What, are you going to pipe in every time I talk?",2
LIZA,Can it!,2
ZACH,Stuff it!,2
LORELAI,They're in love.,2
SOOKIE,Clearly.,2
ZACH,"So, Mrs. Got Bucks out there not only has a cameraman, she's got a sound guy, too.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, no.",2
ZACH,It's like a Baz Luhrmann movie out there.,2
SOOKIE,"That's Emily, right?",2
LORELAI,Shh!,2
LIZA,Rich people feel so entitled.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, damn them!",2
ZACH,"I swear, I saw her wipe her face with a hundred dollar bill.",2
LORELAI,"We should line them up against a wall, you know what I'm saying?",2
WOMAN,Is Lorelai Gilmore here?,2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
WOMAN,"Oh, good. Have a look at these, will you?",2
LORELAI,Wow!,2

WOMAN,Look them over and take your pick.,2
LORELAI,What for?,2
WOMAN,To wear.,2
LORELAI,Are they for sale?,2
WOMAN,"No, they're paid for. These are from your mother, Emily Gilmore.",2
LIZA,"Wow, ritzy.",2
LORELAI,I really don't want to wear a corsage.,2
WOMAN,They're all paid for.,2
LORELAI,"Really, it's too much.",2
WOMAN,Your mother wants you to pick one.,2
LORELAI,"Really, it's okay.",2
WOMAN,She'll just come back here herself.,2
LORELAI,"This one, thanks.",2
WOMAN,Good choice. The cameraman said that would look best on film.,2
ZACH,So you're the rich girl.,2
LORELAI,"Maybe. I'm not rich but . . .my parents have money, but I'm totally self-sufficient. I take nothing from them, except this corsage. . .and my daughter's tuition. So, you gonna stone me?",2
ZACH,"I should have guessed. Look at her friends, they're wearing suits that drip money.",2
JACKSON,"Hey pal, this was thirty percent off!",2
LIZA,"So, that's why you didn't want to get pizza, 'cause it's below you?",2
LORELAI,"Oh, no, no, no, Liza, pizza is not below me. Believe me, I love pizza. I eat tons of pizza. It's one of my four major food",2
groups,"candy, popcorn, and pizza   see? It's two of my food groups, that's how much I love pizza.",2
LIZA,I want to believe you.,2
ZACH,"Enjoy your champagne and caviar at The Ritz, Your Highness.",2
LORELAI,I am not rich! Ugh! My pager.,2
JACKSON,Maybe the suit was a little much.,2
SOOKIE,"You're a fox, now don't start.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, no.",2
SOOKIE,What?,2
LORELAI,Rory's running late.,2
SOOKIE,Late from what?,2
LORELAI,"It doesn't say. It says she's definitely going to be here but if she's not here by seven, she'll sneak in the back. That's weird.",2
SOOKIE,"She'll be here, don't worry.",2
LORELAI,I hope so.,2
SOOKIE,"How 'bout we sit in back, keep an eye out for her, and we'll save her a seat?",2
LORELAI,"That'd be great. Oh, can you hang onto all my stuff for me? I don't want to leave it in here.",2
SOOKIE,Will do.,2
LORELAI,Thank you. Bye.,2
ZACH,"Oh, you don't trust your valuables around us poor kids, huh?",2
LORELAI,,2
SEATMATE,You don't look happy.,2
RORY,I'm late.,2
SEATMATE,Buses are the worst.,2
RORY,Why are we making so many stops? The bus didn't make stops on the way into the city.,2
SEATMATE,"Oh, that was probably an express. This is a local   makes a lot of stops.",2
RORY,I should have checked the schedule. I should have checked traffic. Note to,2
self,impulsive definitely does not work for me. What are you doing?,2
SEATMATE,"Hmm? Oh, uh, it's for my spit.",2
RORY,Your what?,2
SEATMATE,,2
SPEAKERory,Victor David Fuller. . . Nancy Brenda Gatson. . .,2
ZACH,"Making sure the camera's getting your best side, princess?",2
RICHARD,Are you telling me that that is the best commencement speaker they could scrounge up?,2
EMILY,I hope Raul's getting enough sh*ts of Lorelai. I don't want the whole damn ceremony and none of her.,2
RICHARD,"Oh, no, I disagree. I hope he gets every inspired word articulated by the East Coast Marketing Director of Pup  n' Taco.",2
EMILY,Raul!,2
SPEAKERory,Joanne Garver...,2
LORELAI,"Oh, geez. Oh, we're, oh, we're going. . .",2

EMILY,Lorelai.,2
LORELAI,"Well, I did it.",2
RICHARD,Yes.,2
EMILY,Raul thinks he got some good footage.,2
RICHARD,I should hope so. He certainly cost enough.,2
LORELAI,I'm sure it'll be great.,2
EMILY,"Congratulations, Lorelai.",2
LORELAI,Thank you. I'm glad you guys came.,2
EMILY,"Yes, well, we should get going. I guess we'll see you tomorrow for dinner.",2
LORELAI,"Hey, wait. Aren't we going to take a picture?",2
EMILY,Excuse me?,2
LORELAI,"The three of us, me in the middle with the gown, you know   the traditional pose.",2
RICHARD,"Well, uh, we don't have a camera with us.",2
LORELAI,Hold on.,2
EMILY,That's a camera?,2
LORELAI,That's a camera.,2
RICHARD,That looks like a toy.,2
LORELAI,"Um, Raul, would you mind? So. . .",2
RAULorelai,"Okay, on the count of one, two, three, cheese!",2
LORELAI,Thank you.,2
EMILY,"Yes, well, tomorrow then.",2
LORELAI,Absolutely.,2
EMILY,"Let's go, Richard.",2
RICHARD,"I'll be right there, Emily. Congratulations.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, you don't have to do this.",2
RICHARD,Put it towards something fun.,2
LORELAI,"Thank you, Daddy.",2
SOOKIE,"Hey, we're so proud of you!",2
JACKSON,"Yeah, you were great up there.",2
LORELAI,"Thanks, you guys. Where's Rory? No Rory?",2
SOOKIE,She called your cell and I answered and she said she got hung up on something or other and she'll see you at home.,2
LORELAI,Hung up? Hung up where? Is she okay?,2
SOOKIE,"She said she's fine. She's sorry, but fine.",2
LORELAI,"Oh. Well, as long as she's okay, I guess. Um, well, I should probably get the gown back. Thanks for coming, Sook, Marcus Schenkenberg.",2
SOOKIE,You wanna go out to eat? Celebrate a little?,2
LORELAI,"No, I think I'll just go home to Rory.",2
SOOKIE,I thought so. See you tomorrow.,2
LORELAI,Thanks.,2
JACKSON,Wait a minute. . .aspirins instead of Jordan Almonds? But we already bought the almonds.,2
SOOKIE,Wow. Now that's the longest anything's ever taken.,2
JACKSON,My family's not gonna get the joke. Can't we just use the almonds?,2
SOOKIE,,2
RORY,"I'm so, so sorry.",2
LORELAI,"You're okay, right?",2
RORY,Yes.,2
LORELAI,"Everything's working? Your wrist is okay, nothing new is broken?",2
RORY,I'm fine.,2
LORELAI,"Anyone you know, like Lane or someone, suddenly get sick today or break an arm themselves or get in a car wreck?",2
RORY,No.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, good. Then I can get past worry and move onto other things.",2
RORY,I know you're hurt.,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, you bet I'm hurt. Rory, I really wanted you there today, more than anything. You're why I did this stupid thing in the first place.",2
RORY,I know.,2
LORELAI,"It was a once in a lifetime thing. You should've been there. My best friend should've been there. Whatever it was that kept you, you should've gotten out of it, at least this once. Was it school?",2
RORY,It wasn't school.,2
LORELAI,Was it Paris?,2
RORY,It wasn't Paris.,2
LORELAI,"Well, what was it?",2
RORY,It was so stupid.,2
LORELAI,"Well, Rory, where were you? What happened?",2
RORY,I cut school!,2
LORELAI,You what?,2
RORY,"I cut school and I got on a bus and I don't even know why I did it. I. . .I have no excuse. I was just standing outside of Chilton, and I don't know, I must have had a stroke or something. What does a stroke feel like?",2
LORELAI,"I don't know. Not good, probably.",2
RORY,"And I left school and I got on a bus and I went to New York. And that's it! I'm grounded for six months, or seven, and no TV, no stereo, no reading. In fact, take all of my books away from me and lock them up.",2
LORELAI,Hold on here. You went to New York?,2
RORY,"And no magazines, either. And I'm going to do all of the housework. Laundry, dishes. . . infact, we're going to start eating at home so that we have dishes.",2
LORELAI,Rory.,2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,Stop. Why did you go to New York?,2
RORY,To see Jess.,2
LORELAI,"Boy, do you know how to bury the lead.",2
RORY,I don't know what happened.,2
LORELAI,You went to New York to see Jess.,2
RORY,"It was the stroke! It made me someone else, and after his phone call last night -",2
LORELAI,That was him?,2
RORY,"It did something to me, I don't know what. In fact, you should take the phone away from me, too. That's right, add it to the list. No books, no music, no phone.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, Rory. . .",2
RORY,I'm a horrible person.,2
LORELAI,You're not a horrible person.,2
RORY,"I am sick, I'm ill, I'm cracked. This is not who I am. If I were to write this down in my diary and I would read it, I would be like, Who is this freak? This isn't me. This isn't my diary. I wouldn't do this. I wouldn't skip school when I have finals coming up to go see a guy that isn't even my guy and end up missing my mother's graduation, which I wanted to be at so badly. That's someone else. That's someone flighty and stupid and dumb and girly. And, I mean, I missed your graduation, which is the worst thing I could have possibly done. I mean, I hurt you and I had to spend hours on a stinky bus next to a guy that was spitting into a can, just thinking about all of the minutes that were going by that I wasn't at your graduation and they were hurting you, and they should have been hurting you because it was so selfish of this person who wasn't me to do what she did.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, my God, take a breath.",2
RORY,"I don't deserve a breath. No breaths. You should add that to the list. You should beat me, ground me, take the phone away and deprive me of air.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, look, nobody wants to say this any less than me, but I - maybe you don't have a medical condition or a mental problem. Maybe, honey, you are falling for Jess.",2
RORY,No.,2
LORELAI,Well -,2
RORY,"No, I love Dean. Dean is my boyfriend. He will always be my boyfriend. That's it. Forever.",2
LORELAI,"Well, maybe not forever.",2
RORY,,2
LORELAI,"Rory, you cut school.",2
RORY,"Yeah, I know.",2
LORELAI,You got on a bus and went to a strange city in your uniform to see Jess.,2
RORY,I know.,2
LORELAI,"Well, that doesn't mean nothing. That means something. I mean--",2
RORY,No! I don't want to talk about this anymore. The only thing I want to talk about is the list I made on the bus of all the ways I'm gonna make this up to you. You get total control over the remote and the stereo for as long as you want. Total control over takeout food choices and a special surprise present every day for a month and -- oh my God! I left your present on the bus.,2
LORELAI,What present?,2
RORY,"It was a vinyl copy of The Go-Gos original album and it was signed by Belinda, but it's not the only copy and I'm gonna find another copy. That's going on the list, too.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, honey, please. Forget about the list until tomorrow.",2
RORY,"Okay, I'll just go to bed then and...I'll go to my room.",2
LORELAI,Hold on one second. Does this mean I have to eat alone?,2
RORY,"Well, it's up to you. Sending me to bed without supper, you can't lose with that punishment. It's a classic.",2
LORELAI,I'd rather go out with my daughter tonight.,2
RORY,I don't deserve it.,2
LORELAI,"No, but I do.",2
RORY,"Okay, just let me take a shower and get the horrible smell of this horrible day off of me, and then we'll go anywhere you want, my treat, and I won't enjoy it. And then we'll come home and I'll go straight to bed and I'll have a terrible night's sleep, okay?",2
LORELAI,Sounds great.,2
RORY,"I'm so, so sorry, Mom.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, really? 'Cause you didn't make that clear.",2

SOOKIE,Huh?,2
LORELAI,"Sookie, you've gotta be kidding.",2
SOOKIE,What?,2
LORELAI,You cannot walk down the aisle to that.,2
SOOKIE,Why?,2
LORELAI,It's depressing.,2
SOOKIE,It's Ella.,2
LORELAI,It's morbid.,2
SOOKIE,It's a classic song.,2
LORELAI,"A classic song with lyrics about a woman who can't make her relationship work, whose life is filled with emptiness and regret and pain.",2
SOOKIE,"Oh, who listens to the lyrics?",2
LORELAI,Anybody not hanging out with Annie Sullivan by the water pump.,2
RORY,What are these?,2
SOOKIE,"Oh, those are some al ternative songs, but I really like this one the best.",2
LORELAI,"Alternative songs, good. Let's see. Hey Jude.",2
SOOKIE,Paul wrote it for Julian to cheer him up.,2
LORELAI,Seasons in the Sun?,2
SOOKIE,"Oh, a sentimental favorite.",2
Posted,06/02/02 20:28,2
LORELAI,Cat's in the Cradle?,2
SOOKIE,"Oh, it makes you re-examine your priorities.",2
LORELAI,"Don't Cry Out Loud? Sookie, do you even like Jackson?",2
MICHELorelai,"Okay, I have a wonderful suggestion.",2
LORELAI,"Great, let's hear it.",2
MICHELorelai,"Okay, here we go. How about I leave?",2
LORELAI,And then do what?,2
MICHELorelai,"That's it. I leave and I don't have to listen to this insanity anymore. What do you think, huh? Because I love it.",2
LORELAI,"Michel, I am in the wedding, which means you have to run the wedding all by yourself, something you've never done before.",2
MICHELorelai,"Oh, please.",2
RORY,"I'll tell you what, Sookie. How about Lane and I come up with a few more suggestions for you? Still melodic, but not quite as Girl, Interrupted.",2
SOOKIE,"All right, fine.",2
LORELAI,"Great. Michel, how's the RSVP list coming?",2
MICHELorelai,"Well, I must say this has been especially challenging for me. I mean, when you are talking about a wedding with up to forty people all living within a five mile radius, how can one person be expected to keep track of all of that?",2
LORELAI,Just an answer will do.,2
MICHELorelai,"I mean, it got a little hairy there for a moment   I almost had to use a second sheet of paper, you know.",2
LORELAI,"You know, I'm not gonna let you annoy me out of making you handle this.",2
MICHELorelai,"Oh, we'll see.",2
SOOKIE,"Hey, my cousin Carl canceled so I have two empty seats. Anyone else you wanna invite?",2
RORY,"I've got Lane, I've got Dean, I'm good.",2
SOOKIE,What about Emily and Richard?,2
LORELAI,Emily and Richard who?,2
SOOKIE,Your Emily and Richard.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, Sookie, you are way too sweet.",2
SOOKIE,What? She went to all that trouble to help me plan the first phase of the wedding.,2
LORELAI,The crazy phase of the wedding.,2
SOOKIE,"It was still sweet and I appreciated it. I mean, if it wasn't for your mother, I never would've settled on the color pink.",2
LORELAI,Why is that?,2
SOOKIE,"Well, I wanted yellow and she said no.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, with logic like that.",2
SOOKIE,"Come on, just ask her. I want you to.",2
LORELAI,"Okay, I'll ask her.",2
SOOKIE,Good.,2
LORELAI,What are you doing?,2
SOOKIE,It's get happier the second time you hear it.,2
LORELAI,Unh.,2
SOOKIE,,2
LORELAI,Huh. You know what I just realized? Oy is the funniest word in the entire world.,2
RORY,Huh.,2
LORELAI,"I mean, think about it. You never hear the word oy and not smile. Impossible. Funny, funny word.",2
EMILY,"Oh, dear God.",2
LORELAI,Poodle is another funny word.,2
EMILY,"Please drink your drink, Lorelai.",2
LORELAI,"In fact, if you put oy and poodle together in the same sentence, you'd have a great new catch phrase, you know? Like, oy with the poodles already. So from now on, when the perfect circumstances arise, we will use our favorite new catch phrase.",2
RORY,Oy with the poodles already.,2
LORELAI,"I'm telling you, it's knocking  whatcha talking  bout, Willis?' right out of first place.",2
EMILY,"Lorelai, for God's sake, be quiet.",2
MAID,"Dinner's ready, Mrs. Gilmore.",2
EMILY,"Bless you, Inga. Please go tell Mr. Gilmore. He's in his den.",2
MAID,"Yes, ma'am.",2
EMILY,Shall we?,2
RORY,Okay.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, hey Mom, uh, Sookie wanted to know if you and Dad would like to come to her wedding.",2
EMILY,Really?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, it's gonna be great. Small, low key, but fun. She's catering it herself so the food'll be fantastic, and you'd get to see me an d Rory walk down the aisle in two of the least obnoxious bridesmaid dresses ever created.",2
EMILY,"Well, that sounds very nice. When is it?",2
LORELAI,A week from Sunday.,2
EMILY,A week from Sunday?,2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
EMILY,The wedding is in one week?,2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
EMILY,So this is a pity invite?,2
LORELAI,A what?,2
EMILY,"Someone canceled at the last minute and rather than being left with two empty seats, Sookie asked you to ask us. How nice.",2
LORELAI,That's not what happened.,2
EMILY,"No, that's quite all right. Far be it from me to be invited with the first batch of actual wanted guests. This is just fine.",2
LORELAI,"Mom, it's not a pity invite. She really wants you to come.",2
EMILY,Is that so?,2
LORELAI,"Yes, that's so.",2
EMILY,Where's our invitation?,2
LORELAI,What?,2
EMILY,"Our invitation. I mean, she must've at least given you an invitation to give us.",2
LORELAI,She thought it would be more special coming directly from me.,2
EMILY,So she was out of invitations. I never felt so special.,2
LORELAI,"Mom, she wants you to come. There's no reason to be insulted here.",2
EMILY,I guess I should be thrilled that I didn't just get a call from the road as you were on your way there.,2
LORELAI,Do not turn this into something that it's not.,2
EMILY,"Do we have a choice between chicken or fish, or at this point do we just bring our own?",2
LORELAI,Stop.,2
EMILY,"Perhaps she would also like us to pick up some extra ice along the way, or help out parking the cars.",2
LORELAI,"Mom, look, isn't Rory pretty?",2
RICHARD,Apologies all around. I could not get Adamson off the phone.,2
LORELAI,"Dad, glad you're here. We're just talking about how pretty Rory is. Big eyes, baby. Give him the Bambi face.",2
RICHARD,"Oh, Rory gets lovelier every day.",2
RORY,"Why, thank you, Grandpa.",2
EMILY,Oh Richard?,2
LORELAI,Oh my God.,2
EMILY,Guess what Lorelai just told me?,2
RICHARD,What?,2
EMILY,We are invited to Sookie's wedding.,2
RICHARD,"Oh, how nice. When is it?",2
EMILY,A week from Sunday.,2

RORY,How are your pancakes?,2
DEAN,Good.,2
RORY,Good or really good?,2
DEAN,Good.,2
RORY,"So, not really good?",2
DEAN,"Fine, really good.",2
RORY,Okay. But are they great?,2
DEAN,"Rory, uh, would you perhaps like to trade breakfasts?",2
RORY,"You mean, your pancakes for my eggs?",2
DEAN,Yup.,2
RORY,"Um, okay. Wow, you're crazy, these pancakes are great.",2
DEAN,That's twelve.,2
RORY,"Mm, two more and she'll come in .",2
DEAN,I don't know. She's been walking back and forth out there for twenty minutes and she still hasn't made it to the door.,2
RORY,"Yeah, but look how much closer to the building she's gotten.",2
DEAN,Why don't we just bring her something out?,2
RORY,"No. She and Luke have been in this fight for too long, she's gotta do this.",2
DEAN,You're cruel.,2
RORY,"Tough love, baby. Oops, I think she's coming in.",2
DEAN,How can you tell?,2
RORY,She's got shoe sale face on.,2
LORELAI,"Okay, I did it, I'm in.",2
RORY,Good girl.,2
LORELAI,"It wasn't so bad. Took awhile, but not so bad. Wait, why are you eating?",2
RORY,You took thirty minutes to come in.,2
LORELAI,"But I'm here now and hey, I'm like cheese.",2
DEAN,What?,2
RORY,She gets better with time.,2
DEAN,Ah.,2
RORY,"Sorry gouda, we've got school.",2
LORELAI,But  ,2
RORY,Order breakfast and I'll leave you the paper.,2
LORELAI,"No, but  ",2
RORY,I'll see you tonight.,2
LORELAI,"Dean, don't leave me.",2
RORY,You'll do fine. You'll do fine.,2
LORELAI,Hey.,2
LUKE,Hello.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, good donut selection this morning, really. Good variety, good color, good goodness, good . . . Well, so the choices are there. It all comes down to what I'm in the mood for. Sprinkled or chocolate or jelly or glazed, maple or kiki or apple or, uh, raised. Little donut rhyme there. Never mind. Can I have a chocolate and a sprinkled please?",2
LUKE,Okay.,2
LORELAI,"So, this is how it's gonna be with us now, huh?",2
LUKE,No idea what you're talking about.,2
LORELAI,You're pulling a Mr. Freeze on me.,2
LUKE,I'm not pulling a Mr. Freeze on you.,2
LORELAI,Please. I'm gonna need snow chains just to get out of here.,2
LUKE,I assume you want coffee with your donuts.,2
LORELAI,"I'm sorry, Luke. It was a bad night. I completely freaked out. I said some things. . .did you get my note? I wrote you a note.",2
LUKE,Got your note.,2
LORELAI,You got my note. Did you read my note?,2
LUKE,Read your note.,2
LORELAI,And?,2
LUKE,It was very well-written,2
LORELAI,That's it?,2
LUKE,I also enjoyed the Garfield stationary. That's one funny cat.,2
LORELAI,"I said I was sorry, Luke.",2
LUKE,"Yes, you did.",2
LORELAI,I said it like a million times.,2
LUKE,"You said it four times, but I understand you're embellishing for dramatic effects.",2
LORELAI,Stop.,2
LUKE,Stop what?,2
LORELAI,"Oh, stop this robot talk. If you're mad, just act like you're mad at me.",2
LUKE,I'm not mad at you.,2
LORELAI,"You're being really, really unfair. Rory was in the hospital.",2
LUKE,"Lorelai, what is it exactly that you want me to do? I'm not mad, I'm not holding a grudge, I heard your apology, I feel I'm being polite, I listened to your donut bit, I got you your coffee. What would make you happy?",2
LORELAI,I want Luke back.,2
LUKE,He's standing right here.,2
LORELAI,,2
PARIS,,2
MALLEY,"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Reese McGinly, Schatzi Leason and Paris Gellar, your presidential candidates for next year. Elections will be held this Friday. Good luck to all of you. This concludes today's assembly. You are all dismissed.",2
PARIS,Hey.,2
RORY,Hey.,2
PARIS,Did you get the Little Debbie comment?,2
RORY,Uh huh.,2
PARIS,"All of it? The cream filling, the snack cake?",2
RORY,Every delicious morsel.,2
PARIS,"Good, good. So, how do you think it went?",2
RORY,I think it went fine.,2
PARIS,"Fine, as is better than Reese and Schatzi?",2
RORY,Fine as in fine.,2
PARIS,"Well, how are you skewing the article?",2
RORY,"Well, you'll have to wait and read about it in the Franklin like everyone else.",2
PARIS,"Fine, write whatever you want.",2
RORY,I will.,2
PARIS,Just make sure you mention that Schatzi pulling the Sharon Stone/Basic Instinct bit was a cheap attempt to distract the whole student body from my mandatory recycling program.,2
RORY,"Go away, Randolph.",2
MADELINE,We got it!,2
PARIS,"You do? Well, come on, tell me.",2
LOUISE,"Okay, a hundred and fifty students were polled.",2
MADELINE,A total cross section.,2
LOUISE,We talked to people that we should never have even had to stand near.,2
MADELINE,The hairstyles alone proved the Farrelly brothers are not making this stuff up.,2
PARIS,"I'm sorry, have I ever been mistaken for a patient person?",2
MADELINE,"Right, sorry. Okay, so we added the votes up.",2
PARIS,You added?,2
MADELINE,She added.,2
PARIS,"Good, continue.",2
MADELINE,"Okay, when asked which of the three candidates is the most qualified for the job of president, ninety percent said you.",2
PARIS,Really?,2
LOUISE,"And when asked who of the three candidates would be the most competent president, overwhelmingly the answer was once again you.",2
PARIS,"So that's it, I'm in.",2
MADELINE,Not quite.,2
PARIS,"How is that not quite? Most competent and most qualified, what else is there?",2
LOUISE,"Well, we also polled likability.",2
PARIS,And?,2
MADELINE,And while people think you're smart. . .,2
PARIS,And competent.,2
LOUISE,"And competent, they also find you, well, a tad. . .",2
MADELINE,Scary.,2
LOUISE,Someone thought a Halloween mask of you would sell big.,2
PARIS,"Well, fine, they don't like me. Big deal, right? I'm still most competent.",2
LOUISE,"Yes, but when asked if the likability issue would affect their voting choice, almost a hundred percent said yes.",2
PARIS,"That's crazy. You mean, people would rather vote for a moronic twink who they liked over someone who could actually do the job?",2
LOUISE,"Sad, but true.",2
PARIS,"Well, what do I do?",2
MADELINE,Hope for a sex scandal?,2
PARIS,Louise?,2
LOUISE,"Oh, I'm on it.",2
PARIS,Hey.,2
RORY,Tomorrow with everyone else.,2
PARIS,"So, I have been wracking my brains for weeks trying to figure out exactly who should be my vice presidential candidate, you know? Who would be yin to my yang, Joel to my Ethan, Damon to my Affleck, and then suddenly, it hits me   the perfect person.",2
RORY,Who?,2
PARIS,You.,2
RORY,What?,2
PARIS,"It's genius. We could announce it in the Franklin tomorrow, Gellar and Gilmore. We even have the g-thing going. Never underestimate the power of alliteration, my friend.",2
RORY,I don't wanna be vice president.,2
PARIS,"Oh, come on. Every little girl wants to be vice president.",2
RORY,Not this one.,2
PARIS,But you have to. It's the only way. Please? I'm begging you.,2
RORY,Paris.,2
PARIS,"They hate me, okay?",2
RORY,Who hates you?,2
PARIS,"Everyone. Everyone in the whole school hates me. Oh, yeah, they think I'm the best for the job, but they don't want to go to the mall with me so they won't vote for me and that means I'm going to lose.",2
RORY,"Well, how is my running with you gonna change anything?",2
PARIS,"Because people think you're nice. You're quiet, you say excuse me, you look like little birds help you get dressed in the morning. People don't fear you.",2
RORY,"Hey, I haven't been dressed by a bird since I was two.",2
PARIS,You will soften my image.,2
RORY,You're crazy.,2
PARIS,Please!,2
RORY,"No, I don't want to be in politics. I just want to write about politics.",2
PARIS,You wouldn't have to do anything. I'll do all the work and make the speeches. You just have to sit there and be nice.,2
RORY,No.,2
PARIS,But  ,2
RORY,Bye.,2
PARIS,"Harvard loves this kid of crap. Being vice president is just one more thing to put you ahead of the rest of the hundreds of thousands of straight A students who are applying for the same spot you are. Think about it. You say no, then comes the day when the letter from Harvard arrives. They've turned you down. Enjoy Connecticut State, sucker. Tell me you won't be thinking, what if I had just run with Paris? What if the one thing that could've ensured my place behind those ivycovered walls I just walked away from?",2
RORY,Fine.,2
PARIS,Yes! Okay.,2
RORY,"I guess the thought of just being nice to people never occurred to you, huh?",2
PARIS,,2
LORELAI,"So, how do you feel?",2
RORY,Great.,2
LORELAI,Not at all sad?,2
RORY,About getting my arm back? No.,2
LORELAI,"Really?  Cause I've kind of gotten used to Casty over here. I mean, we decorated him, we talked to him, we protected him from getting wet in the shower.",2
RORY,"Okay, it's time to wean you off of getting attached to inanimate objects.",2
LORELAI,"Casty, no one understands you like I do. What? No, I did not know Mr. Band-Aid said that to you. Ugh, I will talk to him when we get home. DR.",2
SUE,How you doing?,2
RORY,"Dr. Sue, thank God. DR.",2
SUE,"Okay. So Rory, let's get this thing off your arm, huh? What do you say?",2
RORY,Not a word.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"This one here? Wait, which one? Hey, you in the white, come on, point a finger.",2
RORY,Dad?,2
LORELAI,Christopher?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Aha, there you are. Is it still on?",2
LORELAI,What are you doing?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Oh, great, I didn't miss it. Hey, doctor, I'm the dad. DR.",2
SUE,"Hey, nice to meet you, Dad.",2
LORELAI,I can't believe you're here.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Why? I told you last week I wanted to come down for the big unveiling.,2
LORELAI,"I know, but I didn't think you would drive all the way from Boston again. You were just here.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,You getting sick of me?,2
LORELAI,"Frankly, yes. DR.",2
SUE,"Okay, is everyone here now?",2
RORY,I think so. DR.,2
SUE,"Okay, then let's do it.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Great, and doctor, if at all possible, we'd like to keep the arm. DR.",2
SUE,,2
CHRISTOPHERory,So where to next?,2
RORY,"Um, actually, I have to get home. I have to review my campaign platform.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Campaign platform?,2
LORELAI,"Yes, our little Hilary Clinton here is running for student body vice president.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Wow.,2
RORY,"Elections are on Friday, but I can honestly say that I'm very torn about which way I want it to go.",2
LORELAI,I spent four hours making picture buttons. You wanna win.,2
RORY,"But if I win then I have to be vice president next year. Plus, I'll have to spend my summer in Washington for some junior leadership program, which means six straight weeks of me and Paris together in a dorm room.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Hey, how about this? I'll come back here on Thursday night and I'll take you guys to dinner, and then we'll break into Chilton and tamper with some votes.",2
RORY,We can't.,2
LORELAI,Thursday's Sookie's rehearsal dinner.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Oh well, I guess you'll just have to put your trust in a democratic system. Good luck with that.",2
LORELAI,"But if you're gonna be in the area Thursday night, you can come with us to the dinner.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,But it's Sookie's rehearsal dinner.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, she would love it. She's cooking for a thousand. It'll be fun.",2
RORY,"Yeah, I'm bringing Dean.",2
LORELAI,"I mean, if you can't do it, then. . .",2
CHRISTOPHERory,What time?,2
LORELAI,Seven thirty.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,I'm there.,2
LORELAI,,2
PATTY,"Ooh, ooh, a toast, everybody, a toast!",2
KIRK,,2
PATTY,"Well, it's better than the toast he made at the Ubromowitz wedding.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,How long before I move the car?,2
LORELAI,"Hm, give it another ten minutes.",2
KIRK,"Come on, I've gotta go. My mom is waiting. This isn't funny!",2
JACKSON,We need to talk.,2
SOOKIE,What's the matter?,2
JACKSON,"Uh, the bedroom, please.",2
SOOKIE,"Honey, I'm mel ting chocolate here.",2
JACKSON,"Oh, the chocolate can wait. My father just took me aside and handed me this.",2
SOOKIE,He handed you a skirt?,2
JACKSON,"Oh, it's not a skirt, it's a kilt.",2
SOOKIE,Oh. Why did he hand this to you?,2
JACKSON,He gave this to me to wear on my wedding day.,2
SOOKIE,No.,2
JACKSON,"Oh, yes. He wore it on his wedding day, my grandfather wore it on his wedding day.Apparently, there's a long-standing tradition where the men in my family get very airy on the big day.",2
SOOKIE,"Well, honey, if it means that much to him.",2
JACKSON,Are you crazy?,2
SOOKIE,"Well, he's your father.",2
JACKSON,You won't let me w ear shorts in public and you're gonna let me get married in this?,2
SOOKIE,"Well, what're you gonna do?",2
JACKSON,"I'm gonna wear pants. If he doesn't like it, he doesn't have to come.",2
SOOKIE,"He has to come, he's the best man.",2
JACKSON,Too bad!,2
SOOKIE,"Jackson, come on. Shorts are different, they cut you funny!",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Okay, that's it, I need some air. Grab the bottle.",2
LORELAI,,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Wow. I hope the second act's as good as the first one.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, well, it's a wedding. Things are supposed to be horrible.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"When Jackson came out holding that kilt   man, I felt for him.",2
LORELAI,"I know, so did I.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Please, I saw what your face was doing.",2
LORELAI,What? What was my face doing?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,It was counting up how many Brigadoon references you could come up with to t*rture him with at a later date.,2
LORELAI,How dare you accuse my face of that! My face is calling Gloria Alred when we get home.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,How many references?,2
LORELAI,None.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,How many?,2
LORELAI,"Twelve, including a few bars of I'll Go Home with Bonnie Jean.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, I'm begging you, take plenty of pictures of this wedding because I have a feeling it's gonna be a classic.",2
LORELAI,"You know, if you're gonna be in town for the day, you should just come with us and. . .thanks. . .see all the fireworks for yourself.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Okay.,2
LORELAI,Okay?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Yeah.,2
LORELAI,"Just like that, okay?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, if Sookie doesn't mind.",2
LORELAI,What's going on with you?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,What do you mean?,2
LORELAI,"I mean, mister  suddenly I'm everywhere'. How come you can just agree to come to the wedding?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Because I can.,2
LORELAI,Don't you have to check your appointment book?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,It's on a Sunday.,2
LORELAI,"Don't you have to check with Sherry? Chris, what's up?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Nothing. Sherry's not in town.,2
LORELAI,Oh.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"And even if she was, I still don't think she'd mind if I went.",2
LORELAI,Because she's the coolest chick in the world?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Because things aren't going too well for us lately.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, no.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"She had this big business trip planned and before she left, we had a talk.",2
LORELAI,Yikes.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Yeah. We tried to come up with some answers but we couldn't think of anything, so she left and we said we'd take this time apart to think.",2
LORELAI,What have you been thinking?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,About finding an apartment.,2
LORELAI,"Wow, um, that's so weird. Last time I saw you two, you were. . .well, nauseating, actually.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Believe me, we made ourselves sick a few times.",2
LORELAI,I don't know what to say.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"No, there's nothing to say. It's nobody's fault. It just isn't it.",2
LORELAI,You okay?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks.",2
LORELAI,"Well, then, it's decided. You'll come with me to Sookie's wedding and you'll make sure I stop one or two Brigadoon-isms shy of Jackson taking me out with a bagpipe.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,,2
LORELAI,"Oh my God, I'm so tired.",2
RORY,Hey Mom?,2
LORELAI,"Yes, angel?",2
RORY,Do you happen to know where the almonds I made for table five went?,2
LORELAI,No.,2
RORY, Cause they were here last night before Sookie's dinner.,2
LORELAI,Really? How odd?,2
RORY,"Yeah. And this morning, I found some tulle on the staircase leading up to your bedroom.",2
LORELAI,Hmm. Ghosts?,2
RORY,"It took me six hours to make those almond bundles, Mother.",2
LORELAI,"Well, see if you can beat that next time.",2
RORY,So you got home late from Sookie's?,2
LORELAI,"Yeah, I stayed to help her clean up a little. Hey, guess what?",2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,I know something you don't know.,2
RORY,What?,2
LORELAI,"Okay, just rememb er, it's really wrong to gossip, unless it's true or just way too good not to tell everyone you see, whether you know them or not.",2
RORY,"Got it, what is it?",2
LORELAI,"Well   Aw, if that's my conscience calling, tell it enough already, I heard itthe first time.",2
RORY,Hello?,2
PARIS,"How's this sound for a template? I have done my best. I have lost. Mr. Nixon has won. The democratic process has worked its will, so now let's get on with the urgent task of uniting this country.",2
RORY,What is that?,2
PARIS,"Hubert Humphrey's concession speech. Now, other than the part about Nixon, parts of it really seem to apply here.",2
RORY,Paris.,2
PARIS,"Hey, I'm not going to steal it. I'll paraphrase and I'll give him credit.",2
RORY,Paris.,2
PARIS,"Not that the person who actually wins will even know who Hubert Humphrey is, but hey, I bet they'll organize one boffo senior ditch day.",2
RORY,Where are you?,2
PARIS,"In the auditorium. I wanted to be here for one last meet and greet, get them right before they walk in the booth.",2
RORY,Leave that place right now.,2
PARIS,But   .,2
RORY,"People will think that you're insane and generally people are scared of the insane, so see where I'm going here?",2
PARIS,I'm going to lose.,2
RORY,You don't know that.,2
PARIS,"Yes, I do. Because even if I win, I only won because of you. Therefore, either way I lose.",2
RORY,"Come on. Go get a cup of coffee, relax. You deserve this job, I swear. Put away the concession speech.",2
PARIS,Hubert Humphrey must not have been considered very fun either.,2
RORY,"I'll see you at school. God, she wants to win so badly, and me, not so badly. I feel terrible.",2
LORELAI,"Aw, come on. You know you wanna win so you can spend your whole summer in Washington far away from me.",2
RORY,"Please, don't even talk about Washington. It gives me a stomachache.",2
LORELAI,It might be wonderful.,2
RORY,"Good, then you and I will go someday.",2
LORELAI,"Aw, look at you, trying to make Mommy feel like you don't spend every night tunneling out of here with a spoon.",2
RORY,"Get back to the gossip, please.",2
LORELAI,"Oh yeah. Okay. So, guess who's in the process of breaking up?",2
RORY,Brad and Jen?,2
LORELAI,Bite your tongue.,2
RORY,I don't know.,2
LORELAI,Sherry and your dad.,2
RORY,No.,2
LORELAI,Yes.,2
RORY,Dad told you that?,2
LORELAI,Last night.,2
RORY,Wow. But they were so together.,2
LORELAI,"I know. Well, now they're not.",2
RORY,"Well, is he   oh, look at you.",2
LORELAI,What?,2
RORY,You're totally gloating.,2
LORELAI,I'm not gloating.,2
RORY,Then why are you smiling?,2
LORELAI,I'm not smiling. I had a little stroke.,2
RORY,Smiling.,2
LORELAI,"Oh, look, if he was all broken up about it then I would be sad, but he's not, so ha ha.",2
RORY,"Fourth rung of hell, party of one.",2
LORELAI,"Well, at least my feet won't get cold.",2
RORY,Where'd you get that?,2
LORELAI,What?,2
RORY,That. The Jordan almond that you pulled out of your pajama top and ate   where did you get it?,2
LORELAI,,2
MICHELorelai,"All right, the piano movers will be here at eight and the chairs will be set up at nine. All the rooms are made up and ready. I will be in at ten. Now I am going home unless you would like me to stay.",2
LORELAI,"Actually, I would, thanks.",2
MICHELorelai,"No, I'm sorry, I think I said that wrong. I am going home now unless you would like me to stay.",2
LORELAI,"I would love you to stay, thanks for offering.",2
MICHELorelai,"Okay, see, once again, my English not so good. One more time. I am going home now after working six hours longer than I usually work and performing tasks I despise and am ashamed of, and now I am going home to wash off the stench of this horrifying day, that is, unless, for some unknown Godforsaken reason, you need me to stay.",2
LORELAI,"Well, actually   .",2
MICHELorelai,Goodbye.,2
LORELAI,"Hey, can I grab my bag? I'm gonna go in the back and change.",2
EMPLOYEE,Sure.,2
LORELAI,Thank you.,2
SOOKIE,"Hey, I went with the sugared daffodils for the top tier. Let me tell you, they look great. Ooh, I've outdone myself this time.",2
LORELAI,What are you still doing here?,2
SOOKIE,"I just wanted to double check everything for tomorrow. Don't worry, I'm done, everything's fine. I'm now going straight to bed.",2
LORELAI,Your last night as a single woman.,2
SOOKIE,Yup.,2
LORELAI,You still look good.,2
SOOKIE,I still feel good.,2
LORELAI,"Just think of it. As of tomorrow, you can start wearing cold cream to bed and stop shaving your legs.",2
SOOKIE,"That's right,  cause I already got me a man.",2
LORELAI,Go to sleep.,2
SOOKIE,"Okay, see you tomorrow?",2
LORELAI,,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, look who's got Martha Stewart locked in a basement. Did you do all this?",2
LORELAI,"Yeah, I did. How's it look?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,It looks great.,2
LORELAI,Good. What are you doing up?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Couldn't sleep. I sweet-talked the maid into leaving me about ten thousand pillow mints and then I proceeded to eat them all.,2
LORELAI,"Serves you right. Oh God, I'm so exhausted.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Need some help?,2
LORELAI,"No, I'm almost done. I got up and went back to work just now, didn't I?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Yes, you did.",2
LORELAI,"Oh, good,  cause this is not the time to loaf. I'm so happy for Sookie. I mean, it's like a real live love story, and I saw it all happen. I mean, I hired Jackson. I watched them meet. I watched them have several bizarrely intense arguments over mustard greens. I watched them fall in love. I got to see it all. It was a nice show. Hi.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Hi.,2
LORELAI,What was that?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,I have no idea.,2
LORELAI,Chris.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,One more time an d maybe I'll have an explanation.,2
LORELAI,"Ah, this is not happening.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,I hope to God you're wrong.,2
LORELAI,"But it's us. I mean, you and I, we. . .",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Have never been in the same place at the same time.,2
LORELAI,But now. . . My head is spinning.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"It's all the plants in here, too much oxygen.",2
LORELAI,What do we do now?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"You know, I've got a room upstairs.",2
LORELAI,You were that sure you'd get lucky?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,I never dreamed I'd get this lucky.,2
LORELAI,"Aw, that's good.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,,2
LORELAI,What are you doing?,2
SOOKIE,Daffodils. Am I insane? You can't have daffodils on your wedding cake. What was I thinking?,2
LORELAI,Stop what you're doing right now.,2
SOOKIE,There's too much pink.,2
LORELAI,"Sweetie, there's not too much pink.",2
SOOKIE,"Pink is for girls. Jackson's not a girl. Jackson doesn't like pink. I have all this pink, it's like saying,  Hey, screw you. You want a say in this? Well, grow some ovaries.'",2
LORELAI,"Hey, whoa, honey, hey! Put the pastry bag down.",2
SOOKIE,"I can't, I have to fix this.",2
LORELAI,"Sookie, down. Now step away from all things edible. Hey, what happened?",2
SOOKIE,I don't know.,2
LORELAI,"When I left you, you were fine.",2
SOOKIE,"I know. And when I went home, I was fine. And when I went to bed, I was fine. And then I had this dream where suddenly my dress is really, really short in back, you know? So I bolt out of bed and I put my dress on, and it looks okay. But then I panic   what if I'm remembering the dream wrong? What if my dress isn't really screwed up, what if it's my veil? So I put on the veil, then I rememb er I'm serving salmon puffs. Salmon puffs! Okay, completely wrong, so I had to rush over here and try to find another first course, and then I walk in and these daffodils just. . .something snapped and that's when you walked in here.",2
LORELAI,"Honey, you're nervous. It's natural.",2
SOOKIE,"Well, I wasn't nervous until tonight.",2
LORELAI,"Well, that's okay.",2
SOOKIE,I'm scared.,2
LORELAI,I know.,2
SOOKIE,I don't wanna get divorced.,2
LORELAI,I know.,2
SOOKIE,I don't wanna fight all the time and end up bitter.,2
LORELAI,I know.,2
SOOKIE,I don't wanna be one of those women sitting around making jokes about husband number two. I want number one to last.,2
LORELAI,I know.,2
SOOKIE,I want a guarantee.,2
LORELAI,"Sookie, you're gonna be fine.",2
SOOKIE,"I know. No, I don't. Okay, I need to stop obsessing on this. Tell me something.",2
LORELAI,Like what?,2
SOOKIE,I don't know. Anything. Tell me something to make me stop thinking about this.,2

LORELAI,"Oh, yeah.",2
SOOKIE,"Wow, what does this mean?",2
LORELAI,I don't know.,2
SOOKIE,"I mean, is this a good thing?",2
LORELAI,I don't know. I think it is.,2
SOOKIE,"Oh my God, can you imagine if you and Christopher got together after all these years?",2
LORELAI,"Okay, hold on. We haven't even talked about that ourselves yet.",2
SOOKIE,"Ah, ooh God! Oh God.",2
LORELAI,I know!,2
SOOKIE,"Well, when are you gonna talk about it?",2
LORELAI,Probably when I go back up there with the snacks I promised.,2
SOOKIE,He's waiting for you?,2
LORELAI,"Yes, he is.",2
SOOKIE,"Ooh, you've gotta get back up there.",2
LORELAI,You have to get some sleep.,2
SOOKIE,I wanna hear all the details tomorrow.,2
LORELAI,"Mmkay, I'll grab you in between the walking down the aisle and the getting married.",2
LORELAI,Hey Sookie.,2

CHRISTOPHERory,"I do like this hotel. Oh my God, that's good. What is it?",2
LORELAI,"I have no idea, but if Sookie asks, Michel ate it.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"So, should we avoid the subject for awhile or just dive right in?",2
LORELAI,Call me G reg Louganis.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Greg. What just happened here   amazing.,2
LORELAI,I'm not arguing.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, does that mean there's a chance for a repeat amazing?",2
LORELAI,Do you mean right now or just in general?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Both. Let's start with in general.,2
LORELAI,"I don't know, Chris. It's weird, isn't it? We just found this great balance, I've been seeing you more, we've been getting along so well.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,I know.,2
LORELAI,And this thing with Sherry is so recent.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,I know.,2
LORELAI,"And then there's Rory to think about. I mean, we can't just go changing everything on her now. Not unless. . .",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Not unless it's gonna be a pretty permanent change.,2
LORELAI,Yeah.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,And you're so sure it can't be?,2
LORELAI,"No, I'm not so sure.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"The timing seems right, Lor.",2
LORELAI,I know it does.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Maybe all this stuff we went through   that's the journey we needed to take to end up here.,2
LORELAI,Maybe.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Being a family   Mom, Dad, kid, Volvo.",2
LORELAI,"Ugh, the Volvo will have to go.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,It has a nice ring to it.,2

LUKE,"I've never clocked it, Kirk.",2
KIRK,"Well, you think it could be fast?",2
LUKE,"Yes, Kirk. Of all the sandwiches, I do believe the ham on rye is one of the faster ones to assemble.",2
KIRK,What about a patty melt? Same time frame?,2
LUKE,Probably a little longer.,2
KIRK,Really?,2
LUKE,"Yes, I have to grill a hamburger whereas with the other one I just put the ham on the bread.",2
KIRK,What if I wanted the bread on the ham on rye toasted? Are we talking somewhere in between the patty melt and the untoasted?,2
LUKE,Probably.,2
KIRK,Closer to the melt or closer to the - .,2
LUKE,Kirk!,2
KIRK,Peanut butter and jelly to go.,2
LUKE,Coming right up.,2
KIRK,What do you think of this suit?,2

JESS,Fine.,2
LUKE,Your mom?,2
JESS,Fine.,2

JESS,Nah.,2
LUKE,"Then what the hell you doing here, Jess? You know, I, uh, I called you six times. Now I didn't expect you to call me back so we could sit on the phone in bed and watch Sleepless in Seattle together.

LUKE,Why?,2
JESS,"I just, I. . . I just wanna come back.",2
LUKE,"You know what people told me wh en I said you were coming here to live with me? They told me I was crazy, they told me I was insane, they told me to start writing letters to Jodie Foster   but I ignored them. I was so sure that I knew what I was doing and then you showed up and you know what happened? You proved them right. I was crazy, and now after all that has happened, after all the chaos and havoc that you have wreaked, you're seriously standing there wearing a T-shirt with a picture of a butt with hands that are flipping me off, telling me you wanna come back?",2
JESS,You didn't pack up my stuff yet.,2
LUKE,"Uh, no, I've been a little busy.",2
JESS,When were you planning on sending it back to me?,2
LUKE,"What, hey, am I wearing a little brown uniform with UPS stamped on it?",2

LUKE,Okay.,2
JESS,Okay?,2
LUKE,So you're staying?,2

LUKE,"Okay, then. Stay. I gotta get back to the diner.",2
JESS,"I'll help you close up later, all right?",2
LUKE,Sure. She's not home.,2
JESS,Who?,2

DEAN,"Uh, sure, hold on. It's Paris.",2
RORY,What? Hello?,2
PARIS,We've got the band!,2
RORY,What?,2
PARIS,"We got the band! I knew we had most of the academic clubs tied up, but band   they were the wild card  cause believe me, if anybody's going to be truly scared of me, it's some artsy loser with a tuba wrapped around his neck.",2
RORY,"Paris, how did you get this number?",2
PARIS,"Oh, relax. I won't call you on Prince William's precious phone again. I just wanted you to know that we did it, we're in, welcome to the show.",2
RORY,I think we won.,2
DEAN,"Wow. Uh, that's great.",2
RORY,Yeah.,2
DEAN,So I guess this means you'll be spending the summer in Washington.,2

RORY,Bye.,2
LORELAI,Stop it.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Stop what?,2
LORELAI,"Stop looking at me like that or everyone here will think we did it. There, that'll throw them off the track.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,So this morning you woke up and felt sorry about last night?,2
LORELAI,No.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Embarrassed about last night?,2
LORELAI,No.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Eager and willing to repeat last night?,2
LORELAI,"Ah, Mom, Dad, hi.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Richard, Emily.",2
RICHARD,"Well, hello Christopher. What a pleasant surprise.",2
LORELAI,You came.,2
EMILY,"Of course we came, we were invited. Hello Christopher. I mean, why did you think we would not come?",2
LORELAI,I thought you thought the invitation was rude.,2
EMILY,"It was rude. However, it would've been equally rude for us not to attend the wedding when we were perfectly capable of doing so, so we came. That's called rising above it.",2
LORELAI,I see. Do you wanna come back down here long enough to get a drink?,2
EMILY,"Yes, that would be nice.",2
CHRSTOPHERory,I'll get it for you.,2
EMILY,"Champagne, please.",2

EMILY,Really?,2
LORELAI,"Yes. In fact, Mom, you might be seeing a lot more of Christopher from now on.",2
EMILY,Because he'll be visiting his daughter?,2
LORELAI,"Yes, he'll be visiting his daughter.",2
EMILY,,2
CHRISTOPHERory,So I'm guessing your mom talked to you?,2
RORY,"She talks to me al l the time, frequently when I'm begging her not to.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,And she told you what we discussed?,2
RORY,"She mentioned something about it, yes.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,And what do you think about all this?,2
RORY,I don't know. What exactly are your intentions?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Excuse me?,2
RORY,Your intentions   are they honorable?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,Completely honorable.,2
RORY,"Yeah? Because we have been waiting for this for a really long time and we take disappointment extremely hard. I mean it, property damage is often involved.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, I better follow through on this, huh?",2
RORY,I think that's an excellent idea.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Come here, you. It's probably work.",2
RORY,On a Sunday?,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"Hey lady, I've got a lot of responsibility now, okay?",2
RORY,Okay.,2

CHRISTOPHERory,I have to go.,2
LORELAI,"Huh, what, why?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,I have to take care of something.,2
LORELAI,Chris!,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"I'm sorry, really. I'll call you later to see how it went.",2
LORELAI,"No, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What   tell me why you're leaving? What   what's going on?",2
CHRISTOPHERory,Sherry called. She's back.,2

CHRISTOPHERory,"So, what, I'm just. . .I'm gonna do that again? I'm just gonna take off, disappear?",2
LORELAI,No. You're gonna go home.,2
CHRISTOPHERory,"This is absolutely unbelievable. I've waited years for this, Lor. You, Rory, the whole perfect picture and now - .",2
LORELAI,"Listen, I have to walk down the aisle in a minute and be really happy for Sookie and right now I'm having a little trouble standing, so maybe it would be better if you would just go.",2
CHRISTOPHERory,I'm so sorry.,2

LORELAI,You are hilarious!,3
LORELAI,"Okay, see, last night, when I said to you,  Tomorrow, no matter what, make sure I get up at seven,' what I actually meant was,  Tomorrow, no matter what, make sure I have the option of getting up at seven in case when seven comes, I actually wanna get up,' which   as it happened   I didn't. Therefore, you're currently responsible for the great alarm clock slaughter of 2002.",3
LUKE,No survivors?,3
LORELAI,The one shaped like a bunny escaped with a mild decapitation. This is decaf.,3
LUKE,What are you talking about?,3
LORELAI,You switched my coffee again.,3
LUKE,"I'm a busy man. I don't have time to sneak around switching your coffee. I have a diner to run, I have shipments to order, I have things to flip and fry. Will you stop that?",3
LORELAI,"Ha, haha, hahaha! Under the sink, very clever, but not clever enough bucko.",3
LUKE,"Okay, fine, you know what? I give up.",3
LORELAI,Woo hoo!,3
LUKE,Go one day without coffee.,3
Posted,10/06/02 08:31,3

LORELAI,Whoa! Ugh!,3
RORY,Hello?,3
LORELAI,You have to come home.,3
RORY,Mom?,3
LORELAI,"You're gone and the house is quiet and Bill Maher's canceled. The name of the show was Politically Incorrect for God's sake. Didn't anybody read the title? He was supposed to say those things, dammit !",3
RORY,You had another dream.,3
LORELAI,Yes.,3
RORY,The doctor is in.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, I'm lying in bed and I'm sleeping and I'm wearing this fabulous nightgown, and like thirty alarm clocks go off, and so I get out of bed and I walk downstairs, and there, standing is the kitchen, is Luke!",3
RORY,Was he naked?,3
LORELAI,No! He was making breakfast.,3
RORY,Naked?,3
LORELAI,"Okay, you've been in Washington way too long.",3
RORY,"Sorry. Go ahead, he was making breakfast. . .",3
LORELAI,"Eggs and pancakes and bacon, and he put decaf coffee in my regular coffee bag, which of course I knew immed iately.",3
RORY,"Hi, the nose.",3
LORELAI,"Exactly. So eventually I find the real stuff under the sink. He hands me my breakfast, and then . . .",3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,He kissed me an d talked to my stomach!,3
RORY,Why would he do that?,3
LORELAI,Because apparently I'm pregnant!,3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,With twins! Say something.,3
RORY,You are going to be so fat.,3
LORELAI,"Just analyze my dream, please.",3
RORY,"Okay. Well, your dream was telling you that you are secretly in love with Luke and you wanna marry him and have his twins.",3
LORELAI,"Uh, no, try again.",3
RORY,"What do you mean, try again? You asked me to analyze your dream, I analyzed your dream.",3
LORELAI,"Yes, well, I reject that analysis, so I'd like another one, please.",3
RORY,You can't just reject an analysis and try again. You're not shopping for bathing suits here.,3
LORELAI,Give me an other analysis or I'll put your Taylor hula-hooping dream into a whole other context.,3
RORY,"I told you, Taylor was supposed to be Dean. I could tell by his freakishly thick head of hair.",3
LORELAI,I'm waiting.,3
RORY,"Okay, maybe you're still upset about what happened with Dad and you're jealous of Sherry because she's having his baby and not you. Mom?",3

JACKSON,"Once, that happened once.",3
LORELAI,"Well, once was enough.",3
SOOKIE,"Oh, hey, honey, I got those paint chips that we were talking about. Do you wanna look at them now?",3
JACKSON,Nope.,3
SOOKIE,But it'll only take a minute and I actually went though and picked out a couple of colors for you.,3
LORELAI,What are you painting?,3
JACKSON,Nothing.,3
SOOKIE,The house.,3
LORELAI,The whole house?,3
JACKSON,No.,3
SOOKIE,Just the inside.,3

JACKSON,It's not such a big undertaking since we're not undertaking it.,3
SOOKIE,"I know, but it'll be fun.",3
LORELAI,Rory and I'll help if you want.,3
JACKSON,"Okay, if you're gonna come over here everyday, you have to actually hear both of us.",3
LORELAI,"Oh. Well, tell me w hy you're not painting just the inside of the house?",3
SOOKIE,Because it was my house and now it's our house and I want it to feel like our house.,3
JACKSON,I'm totally happy with the way this house feels.,3
SOOKIE,How can you be? There's flowers everywhere.,3
JACKSON,I like flowers   I'm a produce guy.,3
SOOKIE,The curtains are ruffly.,3

LORELAI,I'll try.,3
LORELAI,"All right, I've only got a minute and then I have to leave. Is there any more bacon?",3
SOOKIE,Have mine. What do you think about mahogany for the living room and then midnight blue for the hallway and the bedroom?,3
LORELAI,"Sookie, Jackson just said he's fine with how everything is. I don't think it's bugging him.",3
SOOKIE,"Well, he may not think so now but it'll bug him eventually and then he'll resent this place and me by extension and I would like to avoid that. And I can   I just need to butch the place up a little. Now, help me pick a color.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, I can't now, but I'll do it later.",3
SOOKIE,Okay.,3
LORELAI,"Thanks for breakfast, it was amazing, I love you, I love the bacon. Oh, hey, bacon's manly. Why don't you just nail a bunch of packages of Kosher bacon on the walls, huh? Smells like meat blessed by a rabbi   now that's a manly house.",3
SOOKIE,Buh-bye.,3
LORELAI,,3
TAYLORory,"Watch those streamers! And not too much red near that tree   light touch, light touch, light touch.",3
LORELAI,"Hey Taylor, how's the leg?",3
TAYLORory,It's just fine.,3
LORELAI,"Still haven't found out who put that banana peel on your doorstep, huh?",3
TAYLORory,"No, but I have a list of suspects.",3
LORELAI,"Hey, um, what's all this for?",3
TAYLORory,"This, young lady, is for the first annual Stars Hollow End of Summer Madness Festival.",3
LORELAI,"You finally found a way to fill September, didn't ya?",3
TAYLORory,This is gonna be a very exciting day. I'm really gonna go all out for this. I even think you'll be impressed.,3
LORELAI,"Really, even me?",3
TAYLORory,"Yes-sir-ee, mini-me, I did not put the word madness in the title for nothing. This place is gonna be crazy, wild   food, games, we've even got a band coming all the way from New York!",3
LORELAI,New York   that's just nuts!,3
TAYLORory,And wait  til you see the banner I ordered. It's gonna make every other banner we've ever had look downright embarrassing.,3
LORELAI,"Taylor, you're on fire.",3
TAYLORory,"Oh, I love this banner!",3
LORELAI,I can't wait to see it.,3
TAYLORory,,3
PARIS,"I mean, come on, Senator Boxer, as one of our foremost Democratic leaders, I ask you   do you really think it looks good to have the American Secretary of the Treasury traveling around with Bono? I mean, I know apparently he's a saint, he's going to save the world, yada, yada, yada, but my God! He never even takes the sunglasses off. We have an image to maintain, don't we? I mean, aren't we at least trying to pretend we're the superpower in this world? I mean, why not just send Carson Daly over to the Middle East next time Cheney goes, huh? Or hey, hook up Freddie Prinze Jr. with Colin Powell next time he meet s with NATO. I mean, hell! Let's hear what Freddie has to say, right? SENATOR",3
BOXERory,"Oh, great, Doug. Uh, Paris, do you know Republican Congressman Doug Ose from California? You don't? Great. You two will have so much to talk about. Bye. CONGRESSMAN",3
OSE,"Uh, Barbara ",3
PARIS,"Ose, right? CONGRESSMAN",3
OSE,Yes that's right.,3
PARIS,Let's take a walk.,3
JAMIE,Last day here.,3
RORY,Yup.,3
JAMIE,"So, in your opinion, how was our nation's capital?",3
RORY,"Well, I got to see Archie Bunker's chair at the Smithsonian Museum, so it was a big thumbs up for me.",3
JAMIE,"Yes, there are times when this country's priorities are exactly right. So, where's Paris?",3
RORY,"Hm, not quite sure. Last time I saw her, she was beating the will to live out of our nation's representatives.",3
JAMIE,"She is a hammer , isn't she?",3
RORY,"Actually, she's the entire toolbox.",3
PARIS,Damn. I always seem to catch the most interesting politicians right when they have to use the bathroom. Hey Jamie.,3
JAMIE,Paris. Just came over to let you know I got a little sneak peak at the final debate pairings for today. It seems like you and I are going to be on the same side this time.,3
PARIS,You're kidding? You'd think they'd like to give someone else a fighting chance for once.,3
JAMIE,Apparently not.,3
PARIS,"God, I love this. You don't realize how unqualified most of America's youth is until you gather them all up in a room and make them speak. So, who are we up against?",3
JAMIE,Jason Roundsevault and Ty Fredericks.,3
PARIS,Perfect. Jason's got asthma and Ty cries.,3
JAMIE,"Okay, so we should meet early and go over strategy, make sure you bought enough Kleenex.",3
PARIS,"Good, good.",3
JAMIE,And then tonight we should get together and celebrate over dinner.,3
PARIS,What if we don't win?,3
JAMIE,Don't lose it on me now.,3
PARIS,You're right.,3
JAMIE,"So, dinner?",3
PARIS,Sure.,3
JAMIE,"Good, I'll swing around for you about seven.",3
PARIS,Fine.,3
JAMIE,"Okay, see you at the slaughter.",3
RORY,Wow!,3
PARIS,"Yeah, can you imagine pairing me with Jamie? I mean, why not just line the hallways with self esteem counselors right now.",3
RORY,Paris?,3
PARIS,What?,3
RORY,What do you mean what? He just asked you out on a date.,3
PARIS,He did not.,3
RORY,"Yes, he did. You're having dinner with Jamie tonight.",3
PARIS,"It's a victory dinner, that's it.",3
RORY,"Paris, if he just wanted to celebrate winning a debate, you guys could've had coffee afterward, but he asked you out on a date.",3
PARIS,He did?,3
RORY,Yes.,3
PARIS,Did I accept?,3
RORY,Yes.,3
PARIS,I'm going on a date?,3
RORY,"Yes, you are.",3
PARIS,"Oh man, I can't believe this! I finally get asked out on a date and I missed it? Was it a good ask-out?",3
RORY,It was a very good ask-out.,3
PARIS,"God, I wish I'd been there.",3
RORY,"Well, you'll be there tonight.",3
PARIS,,3
KIRK,"One day it occurred to me, cows never wrinkle.",3
MICHELorelai,Mmhmm.,3
KIRK,"Think about it   have you ever seen a wrinkled cow? No, not once. So I thought to myself, ""That is weird.""",3
MICHELorelai,"Yes, that and other things.",3
KIRK,"So I decided to do a little research. I studied cows, I studied humans, and finally I discovered the secret   the secret of the cows.",3
LORELAI,"Michel, could you, uh. . .hi Kirk.",3
MICHELorelai,"Oh, good, just in time. Kirk here is about to tell us the difference between cows and humans.",3
LORELAI,"You mean, other than one's a cow?",3
MICHELorelai,"Shh. Go ahead, Kirk.",3
KIRK,Hay.,3
LORELAI,Huh?,3
KIRK,"Hay, it's hay   cows eat hay. And after some experimentation and a great deal of research, I developed what I believe to be the next great skin care product to sweep the nation.",3
LORELAI,Hay There.,3
KIRK,"A complete line of creams, balms, toning lotions, and cleansing liquids.",3
LORELAI,"Kirk, we already have a skin care line here, I'm sorry.",3
KIRK,"I am willing to give you three cases of ""Hay There"" skin products absolutely free of charge. Try them, you will see what I'm talking about.",3
LORELAI,"Well, uh, thank you very much, Kirk. . . but, I'm sorry   don't cows eat grass?",3
KIRK,"Sometimes, but ""Grass There"" is a bad name.",3
MICHELorelai,"So sad not to have a cocktail in your hand every time he comes by, no?",3
LORELAI,"Independence Inn, Lorelai speaking.",3
EMILY,What day is this?,3
LORELAI,Mom?,3
EMILY,What day is this?,3
LORELAI,"Mom, I have a group of  ",3
EMILY,It's Thursday.,3
LORELAI,"Thank God. Now, could I possibly  ",3
EMILY,"Thursday the what, Lorelai?",3
LORELAI,It's  ,3
EMILY,"Thursday the third. And what was happening Thursday the third, Lorelai?",3
LORELAI,I believe it was the day I was supposed to chew my own head off.,3
EMILY,Your father and I were coming home from Martha's Vineyard.,3
LORELAI,I know you were.,3
EMILY,"And you said that when we got home, you were going to call us.",3
LORELAI,I know I did.,3
EMILY,"Well, we're home, and yet there's no call, no message, no card.",3
LORELAI,"Mom, it's eleven o'clock in the morning. I said I would call you on Thursday, I didn't say when on Thursday, I just said Thursday. Technically I haven't screwed up for another twelve hours.",3
EMILY,"Lorelai, everyone knows that you are supposed to call people as soon as they have arrived home. That's the polite way to do it.",3
LORELAI,You didn't tell me w hat time you were coming home.,3
EMILY,"Well, you never asked what time we were coming home.",3
LORELAI,"Yes, but you never told me so there's no way I could know, so even though I didn't ask I still didn't know and it's only elev. . .I'm sorry.",3
EMILY,Apology accepted. Now I assume we'll be seeing you and Rory for dinner tomorrow?,3
LORELAI,"Uh, you'll see me but Rory doesn't get back  til Saturday.",3
EMILY,"Oh, what a shame. I thought she was coming back tomorrow.",3
LORELAI,"Nope, she's coming back Saturday.",3
EMILY,"Well, I'm very disappointed. I had it written down for tomorrow.",3
LORELAI,"Well, you must've written it down wrong, Mom. She's coming home Saturday.",3
EMILY,"Your father thought it was tomorrow, also.",3
LORELAI,See you at seven.,3
EMILY,"Hold a moment, Lorelai. Do you know where Christopher is?",3
LORELAI,"Um, why?",3
EMILY,"We wanted him to come w ith you and Rory tomorrow, even though apparently Rory's getting back Saturday, though I couldn't sworn it was tomorrow.",3
LORELAI,Christopher's away on business but I'll tell him you invited him.,3
EMILY,And tell him to come w ith you two next week. I wanna see the three of you together.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, that would be a nice picture.",3
EMILY,"All right, see you tomorrow.",3
LORELAI,,3
RORY,My plane gets in at three.,3
DEAN,I'm in at six.,3
PARIS,"Red, purple, green   where the hell is it?",3
RORY,"That gives me three hours to look presentable. Hm, perhaps I'll go blonde.",3
DEAN,I strongly request that you don't.,3
RORY,Afraid of change?,3
DEAN,"No, I just like what I have.",3
RORY,I like a man who settles.,3
DEAN,I miss you.,3
RORY,"I miss you, too.",3
PARIS,"Hey, hey, stop being cute. I need help here.",3
RORY,I have to go. Paris is melting down.,3
DEAN,Why?,3
RORY,She has a date tonight.,3
DEAN,Really?,3
PARIS,Don't sound so surprised.,3
RORY,How do you know he sounded surprised?,3
PARIS,"Because I'm a genius, Rory. I have deep and powerful clairvoyant abilities.",3
RORY,Oh boy.,3
PARIS,"For example, I can instantly deduce that when someone hears the name Paris in the same sentence with the word date, jaws will drop, confused looks will cover faces, words like  how' and  why' and  Quick, Bob, get the children in the minivan because the world is obviously coming to an end!' will immed iately fly out of people's mouths.",3
RORY,I have to go.,3
DEAN,Are you sure it's safe?,3
RORY,I'll be fine. I'll see you Friday.,3
DEAN,See you Friday. I love you.,3
PARIS,"That's it, I'm shaving my head.",3
RORY,"Gotta go. Okay, Paris, you have got to calm down.",3
PARIS,I had a black sweater and now it's gone.,3
RORY,"I'm not just talking about right now   in general, you need to calm down.",3
PARIS,"He's almost here, I'm not dressed, my makeup's not done, and I haven't gone through the Zagat yet to pick out a restaurant.",3
RORY,Why don't you just let him pick out the restaurant?,3
PARIS,What if he doesn't have a Zagat?,3
RORY,"Well, then he'll wing it.",3
PARIS,"Wing it? How come other girls get planned out dinners? Flowers, candy, rose petals thrown on the floors   and I get wing it?",3
RORY,"Well, you don't know that you've got wing it.",3
PARIS,"No, I do. I've got wing it. I can't do this.",3
RORY,What?,3
PARIS,Date. I can't date. I'm not genetically set up for it.,3
RORY,Not true.,3
PARIS,"I get no pleasure out of the prospect or the preparation. I'm covered in hives, I've showered four times, and for what? Some guy who doesn't even have the brains to buy a Zagat so we don't wind up in a restaurant that's really just a front for a cocaine laundering ring?",3
RORY,Sit.,3
PARIS,It's a dare. He was dared to take me out. I bet Trent Lott was behind this.,3
RORY,Trent Lott did not dare Jamie t o take you out. Close. Jamie likes you and he asked you out because he likes you. Now look up.,3
PARIS,"Maybe I shouldn't go. I mean, what if I fall for him and he doesn't like me?",3
RORY,Then you'll find someone else.,3
PARIS,But what if there is no one else?,3
RORY,Then you'll buy some cats.,3
PARIS,"I wish I knew if he was right for me, you know? So I don't put myself through all of this for nothing. I mean, women fall for men who are wrong for them all of the time, and then they get sidetracked from their goals. They give up careers and become alcoholics and, if you're Sunny von Bülow, wind up in a coma completely incapable of stopping Glenn Close from playing you in a movie.",3
RORY,I think you should wear your hair down.,3
PARIS,How do you know if a guy is right for you?,3
RORY,You just have to feel it.,3
PARIS,All I feel is my back breaking out.,3
RORY,"You'll know, okay? You just have to let it happen. And then, probably when you're not looking, you'll find someone who compliments you.",3
PARIS,Meaning?,3
RORY,"Someone who likes what you like, someone who reads the same books or listens to the same music or likes to trash the same mo vies. Someone compatible.",3
PARIS,Okay.,3
RORY,But not so compatible that they're boring.,3
PARIS,Someone who's compatible but not compatible.,3
RORY,"Yeah, kind of. I mean, you respect each other's opinions and you can laugh at the same jokes, but I don't know   there's just something about not quite knowing what the other person's gonna do at all times that's just really exciting. Look, just have a good time, you'll figure it out.",3
PARIS,"Yeah, well, I hope I figure it out fast. . .before I throw up.",3
PARIS,That's him.,3
RORY,Turn around.,3
PARIS,Well?,3
RORY,Perfect.,3
PARIS,Promise?,3
RORY,Swear.,3
PARIS,Thanks. Now get in the closet.,3
RORY,What?,3
PARIS,"If he comes in here and sees you, he won't wanna date me anymore.",3
RORY,"Paris, that's crazy! He's seen me   he's seen me for weeks.",3
PARIS,"Yes, in conferences, crowded lecture halls, badly lit banquet rooms with crappy food smells, not at night when it's dating time an d he's thinking about dating and you're standing there looking all datable.",3
RORY,I'm not looking datable.,3
PARIS,"Please? I can't risk it. At least if there's nothing to compare me to, then I've got a fighting chance, please!",3
RORY,"Okay, but when you get home, you need to get a new therapist because the one you have is really not working.",3
PARIS,Thanks for helping me get ready.,3
RORY,Any time.,3
PARIS,Hi.,3
JAMIE,Hello. You look very nice.,3
PARIS,"Well, this is a really good sweater.",3
JAMIE,"So, shall we get going?",3
PARIS,"Oh, sure, sure.",3
JAMIE,Do you like Italian food?,3
PARIS,I love Italian food.,3
JAMIE,"Good. I've made a reservation at a great place. Well, at least, that's what the Zagat guide says.",3
PARIS,You're perfect.,3
JAMIE,,3
SOOKIE,How could you not tell them?,3
LORELAI,"Well, they left two days after your wedding and they were in Martha's Vineyard all summer . It just seemed quieter.",3
SOOKIE,"What do you think, manly?",3
LORELAI,"In an Oscar Wilde sort of way, absolutely.",3
SOOKIE,"You know, you're gonna have to tell them tonight, right? I mean, the subject will come up. They probably think you and Christopher are heading down the aisle any day now.",3
LORELAI,"Ugh, I know, I know.",3
SOOKIE,"A shaving table, it's perfect!",3
LORELAI,And twelve hundred dollars.,3
SOOKIE,,3
KIM,"What do you mean, for what? This is an antique.",3
SOOKIE,,3
KIM,This was Sherman's shaving table.,3
LORELAI,,3
KIM,"General Sherman, famous man, burned Atlanta, liked a close shave.",3
LORELAI,,3
KIM,"All original, perfect shape. I give you ten percent off, you want it?",3
SOOKIE,,3
KIM,I know it's very nice.,3
LORELAI,"Boy, she would've made a great nun.",3
SOOKIE,So how are you planning on telling them?,3
LORELAI,"I thought I'd do it like Nell. You know, chicka chicka chickabee.",3
SOOKIE,"Yeah, that's a very good idea.",3
LORELAI,"I'll tell them, I promise.",3
SOOKIE,"Oh, oh my God, look!",3
LORELAI,What?,3
SOOKIE,For over the mantelpiece. It's perfect!,3
LORELAI,It's a dead fish.,3
SOOKIE,"It's an antique stuffed and mounted trout, and I think it's manly.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, please!",3
SOOKIE,It is! It's very Ralph Lauren.,3
LORELAI,"Sookie, Jackson loves you. You're not seriously telling me the future of your marriage depends on Leon Troutsky over there.",3
SOOKIE,I guess not.,3
LORELAI,"Just think about it, okay? You don't have to make every decision right now. Do a little more shopping. Maybe you'll find something even more disgusting someplace else.",3
SOOKIE,Okay.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, I gotta go pick up Rory at the airport, and then we'll swing by and pick up you guys for the festival.",3
SOOKIE,Great.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, see you later.",3
SOOKIE,Bye.,3
LORELAI,,3
KIM,Twenty.,3
LORELAI,,3
KIM,I never kid.,3
LORELAI,,3
LORELAI,Hey Gilmore!,3
RORY,Mom!,3
LORELAI,"Ow, ow!",3
RORY,Ah!,3
LORELAI,Ow!,3
RORY,Ah!,3
LORELAI,Oh!,3
RORY,Agh!,3
LORELAI,"Oh, oh! Luckily there are video cameras everywhere that caught that very graceful moment on tape.",3
RORY,I am so glad to see you!,3
LORELAI,"No, I'm glad to see you!",3
RORY,I'm never leaving home ag ain.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, that's my emotionally stunted girl! Hey, I got you gifts.",3
RORY,"What? I'm the one that left town, I'm supposed to get you gifts.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, but I got here early and there was nothing to do except feed gummy bears to the b*mb-sniffing dogs which, apparently, the United States government frowns upon.",3
RORY,You got in trouble with the government while you were waiting for me?,3
LORELAI,Just a little.,3
RORY,How much is a little?,3
LORELAI,"Learn Russian. Okay, here you go.",3
RORY,"Wow, a Hartford, Connecticut sweatshirt.",3
LORELAI,"Nice, huh?",3
RORY,"Hartford, Connecticut notebook, Hartford, Connecticut pencil set, a Hartford, Connecticut shot glass.",3
LORELAI,And beer mug!,3
RORY,"Hartford baguette, Hartford bear, a Hartford sunglasses.",3
LORELAI,You like?,3
RORY,I love.,3
LORELAI,"All right, let's go. We'll get your bags, then we'll hit the road, and I can't wait to hear all about Washington. And, by the way, I got you out of dinner with the Gilmores tonight. I thought you and Dean might enjoy a little Peaches and Herb time together.",3
RORY,"Oh, thanks. What'd you tell them?",3
LORELAI,That you get home tomorrow.,3
RORY,Big fat lie.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, which proves how much I love you. The fact that I was willing to lie to my own parents who I never lie to just so you could have a night of happiness is proof positive of my deep undying devotion that I have for you.",3
RORY,I appreciate that.,3
LORELAI,"And all that devotion can be yours for the low, low price of $29.95!",3
RORY,Forget it.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, I'll throw in a set of steak knives.",3
RORY,"My bags, please?",3
LORELAI,,3
LORELAI,"Oh my God, you do know one option was leaving some of your books at home?",3
RORY,"Hey, I offered to carry that one.",3
LORELAI,"Next time, don't offer   insist. Look, I'm lopsided now.",3
RORY,I can't believe I'm home. I feel like I've been away forever.,3
LORELAI,I agree.,3
RORY,Hello living room.,3
LORELAI,"Hello Rory, we missed you. Not the ottoman, of course, but everyone knows he's a snob. Napoleon complex, he only really likes the magazine rack.",3
RORY,"Oh my God, I missed everything. My kitchen, my room, my books, my CDs, my stuff. Where's my pillow?",3
LORELAI,What?,3
RORY,You took my pillow.,3
LORELAI,I did not take your pillow.,3
RORY,"You waited until I left, you went into my room, and you took my pillow.",3
LORELAI,"Well, you weren't using it.",3
RORY,What else did you take?,3
LORELAI,Nothing. Your comforter came into my room by itself. . .and brought your Bauhaus T-shirt with it.,3
RORY,I want my stuff back by tomorrow morning.,3
LORELAI,Just  cause you leave doesn't mean the world stops.,3
RORY,By noon.,3
LORELAI,Fine.,3
CHRISTOPHERory,"Lor, it's me, please just call  ",3
RORY,Dad?,3
LORELAI,Yeah.,3
RORY,"Still haven't talked to him yet, huh?",3
LORELAI,"No, you?",3
RORY,Nope.,3
LORELAI,He's called.,3
RORY,"I know. He's called me, too.",3
LORELAI,I just. . .I don't really know what to say.,3
RORY,How long are you gonna freeze him out for?,3
LORELAI,I don't know.,3
RORY,Right.,3
LORELAI,You?,3
RORY,I don't know either.,3
LORELAI,I have to tell my parents tonight.,3
RORY,"Are you sure you don't want me to go with you and . . . I don't know, distract them?",3
LORELAI,"No, you've got Dean coming over. I'll be fine. I'll bring them something shiny.",3
RORY,"Okay, I'm gonna go change then.",3
LORELAI,For what?,3
RORY,The festival.,3
LORELAI,"Hon, you know what, if you don't wanna go, we don't have to go.",3
RORY,Why would I not wanna go? Of course I wanna go.,3
LORELAI,"You just got home, you've got Dean coming over.",3
RORY,"No, I wanna go. I wanna go because this is our town and we need to support these things.",3
LORELAI,"All right, but. . .you don't have to change for that.",3
RORY,"Well, I've been away for awhile, I wanna make a nice impression.",3
LORELAI,On who?,3
RORY,Whoever has to look at me.,3
LORELAI,"All right, just hustle. I promised Jackson and Sookie I'd pick them up along the way.",3
RORY,I'll just be a minute.,3
LORELAI,No woman is ever a minute when she changes.,3
RORY,Do not judge me by your own standards.,3
LORELAI,"Wow, fancy.",3
RORY,Not fancy.,3
LORELAI,"You know, you'll have time to come home and change for Dean.",3
RORY,"Well, I can just change now, then I won't have to do it later.",3
LORELAI,"Okay. Hey Rory, I don't want you to freeze out your dad because I am.",3
RORY,I'm not.,3
LORELAI, Cause I'm fine if you wanna go back to the way things were.,3
RORY,I think that would be a little hard this time.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, maybe not now, but eventually.",3
RORY,"Eventually, maybe, but for now   solidarity sister.",3
LORELAI,Ya ya!,3
RORY,"You've been waiting for six weeks to do that, haven't you?",3
LORELAI,Ya ya!,3
RORY,,3
LORELAI,"See, three minutes faster. I also found a way to get to Al's Pancake World that shaves a good forty seconds off our normal route.",3
RORY,"You were really bored when I was gone, weren't you?",3
LORELAI,You have no idea.,3
JACKSON,Are you crazy? Have you lost your mind?,3
SOOKIE,I don't understand why you're so upset.,3
JACKSON,How can you not understand? I told you a thousand times.,3
SOOKIE,I thought you were just being nice.,3
JACKSON,"Nice! Sookie, look at this place!",3
SOOKIE,I think it looks nice.,3
JACKSON,Nice. . .nice? This is nice. . .this is nice?,3
SOOKIE,"Well, it's masculine!",3
JACKSON,"No, it's terrifying! I swear I'm gonna come out in the middle of the night for a drink of water, turn around, hit the floor and play dead!",3
SOOKIE,"Okay, so, we have a little work to do.",3
JACKSON,Just put it back the way it was.,3
SOOKIE,"No, I want you to be happy!",3
JACKSON,"I was happy, I told you I was happy, you just didn't wanna believe I was happy!",3
LORELAI,We'll just check on them a little later.,3
RORY,Excellent idea.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, so, do we do cheese stick, hot dog, cotton candy, or do we mix it up a little   start with the cotton candy and end with the cheese stick? Who are you looking for?",3
RORY,"No one, I'm just taking in all the madness, that's all.",3
LORELAI,Ah.,3
KIRK,"Lorelai, good. Have you used the cream yet?",3
LORELAI,"Uh, not yet, Kirk.",3
KIRK,"Good, there's been a little problem.",3
LORELAI,What kind of problem?,3
KIRK,"Nothing of major concern. It just seems that with continual use, the cream develops some weird reactions to light. . .and air. . .and movement.",3
LORELAI,Are you serious?,3
KIRK,"Don't worry, it's just a small kink. It'll all be worked out soon.",3
LORELAI,I have three cases of that stuff sitting at the inn.,3
KIRK,"Well, get rid of it.",3
LORELAI,Kirk.,3
KIRK,"Uh, but don't throw it in the trash. Apparently, that would be an EPA violation.",3
LORELAI,What am I supposed to do with the stuff?,3
KIRK,sh**ting it into space is about all I've got now.,3
LORELAI,Kirk!,3
KIRK,I'll pick up the cases tomorrow.,3
LORELAI,Thank you.,3
LORELAI,Hey.,3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,Do you sometimes think this town is weird or is it just me?,3
LORELAI,"Hey Taylor, is this where the mosh pit starts?",3
TAYLORory,"Well, hello Lorelai, Rory. So what do you think of the band? Pretty big city, don't you think?",3
LORELAI,"Mm, I sure do.",3
TAYLORory,What?,3
LORELAI,What? I'm agreeing with you. They are smokin'!,3
TAYLORory,"I do not care for that sarcastic tone, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,"Well. . .uh. . .no, I'm being nice here!",3
TAYLORory,You have an opinion on everything. Nothing is ever up to your standards.,3
LORELAI,That is not true. I'm sure these guys are all great barbers.,3
TAYLORory,I don't even know why I bother.,3
LORELAI,"That is it   I have been it for the last. . . What? Oh, well, looks like he's got his  what I did this summer' essay all researched and ready to go. Guess you dodged a b*llet there, huh?",3
RORY,What do you mean?,3
LORELAI,I don't know. It seems kind of lucky that you didn't throw everything away for Jess whenyou see. . .,3
RORY,See what? What am I seeing?,3
LORELAI,You're upset.,3
RORY,"No, I'm not upset.",3
LORELAI,"Yes, you are upset. I know when you're upset  cause you look like my mother.",3
RORY,Thanks a lot.,3
LORELAI,You like my mother.,3
RORY,"Yes, but you don't like your mother, so when you tell me that I look like your mother, it's not exactly a compliment.",3
LORELAI,"Honey, what is wrong?",3
RORY,Oh God!,3
LORELAI,What is it?,3
RORY,It's that!,3
LORELAI,Jess?,3
RORY,Yes!,3
LORELAI,You're upset about Jess?,3
RORY,I said yes.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, it's Jess?",3
RORY,You're not being funny.,3
LORELAI,"It's not my fault that yes and Jess rhyme. Did I exploit the opportunity, of course I did, but . . .Rory, come on. I know you had this crush  ",3
RORY,It wasn't a crush.,3
LORELAI,"Well, I thought it was over. I mean, you haven't talked to him since  ",3
RORY,Sookie's wedding.,3
LORELAI,You talked to him at Sookie's wedding?,3
RORY,Yes.,3
LORELAI,He wasn't at Sookie's wedding.,3
RORY,"Yes, he was. He had just come back and he came to see me.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, so he crashed Sookie's wedding, and. . .",3
RORY,"And nothing. He told me that he was back in town, that he'd moved back, and. . .",3
LORELAI,What Rory? Come on.,3
RORY,"And we kissed, okay?",3
LORELAI,You kissed?,3
RORY,Yes.,3
LORELAI,"You kissed, like. . .you kissed?",3
RORY,Yes.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, who kissed who?",3
RORY,What does that matter?,3
LORELAI,"Because it matters. Did he kiss you, did you kiss each other, did you trip and your faces accidentally   .",3
RORY,I kissed him.,3
LORELAI,Okay.,3
RORY,"And I don't know, I thought he came back here because he liked me or something, and I kissed him and he kissed me back, and now he's over there and I feel so stupid and. . .that girl isn't even his type and -",3
LORELAI,"Rory, what are you doing?",3
RORY,"What do you mean, what am I doing? I'm ranting. You should recognize this, I learned it from you.",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, but you went to Sookie's wedding with. . .with Dean.",3
RORY,I know.,3
LORELAI,And then you ran off to have some thing with Jess.,3
RORY,"It was a kiss, not a thing.",3
LORELAI,A kiss is a thing.,3
RORY,"Well, it wasn't planned, it just happened.",3
LORELAI,"I can't believe it. All this time I'm thinking,  She's with Dean.'",3
RORY,I am with Dean.,3
LORELAI,"No, Rory   kissing another guy is not being with Dean. Ask him, I bet he'd back me up on that.",3
RORY,It was nothing.,3
LORELAI,"Well, then why are you so freaked out?",3
RORY,I'm not freaked out.,3
LORELAI,"Look, kid, you have gotta make up your mind. Jess, Dean, Jess, Dean   it's enough already. If you want Jess, that's fine   go get him, there he is. If you think that's the great love of your life, then great. . .grab a liver treat and a squeaky toy and run to him. Don't worry about that girl because I'm sure he will have moved onto somebody else in about an hour. But do something. Dean has been sweet and supportive and incredibly patient, and now you are officially treating him like dirt, and I'm sorry, but not only is that not you, he doesn't deserve that. God, I wish they knew another song!",3
RORY,I know all of this about Dean.,3
LORELAI,You do?,3
RORY,"Yes, I do. I know how great he is. I knew it before you did!",3
LORELAI,"Well, knowing this has apparently not stopped you from dragging his heart all over this town.",3
RORY,Not fair!,3
LORELAI,"Yes, fair, the fairest, the Snow White of fair.",3
RORY,I don't wanna talk to you about this anymore.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, listen, if you don't wanna be with Dean anymore, cut him loose. Let him find someone who does because this is just so. . .wrong!",3
RORY,"All right, I get it, I . . .just stop!",3
DEAN,Rory! Hey.,3
RORY,Hi.,3
LORELAI,Hi Dean.,3
RORY,I thought your plane didn't get in  til six.,3
DEAN,"Well, I managed to get an earlier flight.",3
LORELAI,"Well, I'm off to dinner with the parents.",3
DEAN,Do you have  ,3
LORELAI,"No, she's off the hook. You guys have all night to. . .talk. Enjoy. Good to have you back, Dean.",3
DEAN,Thanks.,3
LORELAI,See you later.,3
DEAN,"So, did I interrupt something?",3
RORY,"No, nothing. Uh, we were just. . .hi, you're back.",3
DEAN,"Yeah, I'm back   and I'm glad to find you not blonde.",3
RORY,"Yeah, I was just having way too much fun, so . . .",3
DEAN,I missed you.,3
RORY,,3
EMILY,"Lorelai, nice to see you.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, sorry I'm late, Mom.",3
EMILY,"No, don't be sorry. That's what the warm setting was invented for. Richard, Lorelai's here!",3
LORELAI,"Um, Mom, before we get the evening started and all, I wanna tell you something.",3
EMILY,"Well, tell me outside.",3
LORELAI,"No, I'll just do it here.",3
EMILY,Why?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, there's just something about standing near the exit that's really working for me.",3
EMILY,"You're being silly, you don't discuss things standing by a door. Come outside, come on.",3
RICHARD,"I may have to take one more call tonight, Emily. Ben Stellen and I got cut off. Hello Lorelai.",3
EMILY,"Well, come outside with us until he calls back. Lorelai's about to tell us something.",3
RICHARD,"Oh, perhaps that she's decided to buy an accurate timepiece.",3
EMILY,"Oh, Richard. Is Rory okay?",3
LORELAI,"Oh, yes, Rory's fine, I'm fine, everything's fine, it's really not that big a deal.",3
RICHARD,What would you like to drink?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, whatever.",3
RICHARD,"I can't read minds, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,"I really don't care, Dad. Whatever you have.",3
RICHARD,"We have everything, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,"Al right, I'll have a Yaegermeister and a Jell-O shot.",3
RICHARD,"Uh, excuse me?",3
LORELAI,White wine.,3
EMILY,"All right, sit, sit. Now go ahead, tell us.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, well  ",3
EMILY,"Oh, wait just a second. We brought you something from Martha's Vineyard.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, that's great, but maybe we could just do. . . . . .okay, I guess it's present time.",3
EMILY,Open it.,3
LORELAI,"Scone mix, wow.",3
EMILY,"This new little place opened right down the road from our house and they make these wonderful scones, and that is their mix so you can make them right in your own kitchen.",3
LORELAI,"Well, thanks, Mom. I will put this right on the counter and stare at it for many years to come.",3
EMILY,You're not going to make them?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, I'm not really much of a baker.",3
EMILY,But the instructions are right there on the back.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, I know, but still.",3
EMILY,Still what? Those are good scones.,3
LORELAI,"Hey, maybe I'll give this to Sookie and she'll bake them.",3
EMILY,I don't understand why you simply can't follow those directions and make the scones.,3
RICHARD,Rory would love those scones.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, I promise one way or another, the scones will get eaten. That being said, can we please move on?",3
EMILY,"Fine, go ahead, talk, we're listening.",3
LORELAI,"Um, okay, well, um, it's about Christopher.",3
EMILY,"Oh, that reminds me, we got him a captain's hat. Richard, where is that hat? Lorelai can bring it to him.",3
LORELAI,"No, I can't!",3
EMILY,Why not?,3
LORELAI,"Well, it's just, um. . .Chris and I aren't . . .",3
RICHARD,Aren't what?,3
EMILY,"They aren't together anymore, Richard.",3
RICHARD,Why not?,3
EMILY,I'm sure a vague reason is forthcoming.,3
LORELAI,"It just didn't work out, that's all.",3
EMILY,And there it is.,3
LORELAI,I know you're disappointed.,3
EMILY,"Disappointed, oh please! Lorelai, this is ridiculous. The two of you aren't in high school anymore.",3
LORELAI,I know.,3
RICHARD,"Emily, let's not talk about this.",3
EMILY,"No, we are going to talk about it. You're running around like you have no responsibility in life, like you can flit from thing to thing. . .",3
LORELAI,That's not true.,3
EMILY,. . .from man to man.,3
LORELAI,I don't flit from man to man.,3
EMILY,"You have a daughter, this affects Rory too, you know!",3
RICHARD,"Emily, you're wasting your breath.",3
LORELAI,"I know this affects Rory. I'm not doing this lightly. In fact, I'm not doing anything at all.",3
RICHARD,There's no reason to raise your voice.,3
LORELAI,I can't believe this.,3
EMILY,"I wanna know why. I want a reason. I don't want any of this  just because' and  it just didn't work out' nonsense. I want a solid, adult reason why the father of my granddaughter and her mother can't seem to put a family together.",3
LORELAI,His girlfriend is pregnant.,3
EMILY,What?,3
LORELAI,"Sherry is pregnant, and when Christopher found out, he went back to her and that, Mother, is the reason.",3
EMILY,Are they getting married?,3
LORELAI,I don't know   probably.,3
RICHARD,"Oh, of course they're getting married.",3
EMILY,How do you know?,3
RICHARD,"I know because I know Christopher, and Christopher always tries to do the right thing.",3
EMILY,The right thing is for him to be with his family. Lorelai and Rory are his family. He met this woman two minutes ago.,3
RICHARD,"Emily, he is going to be a father.",3
EMILY,He already is a father!,3
LORELAI,I really really don't wanna discuss this anymore.,3
EMILY,"Lorelai, you have to talk to him.",3
LORELAI,There's nothing to talk about.,3
EMILY,Tell him you wanna get married.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, Mom, please stop.",3
RICHARD,"Yes, Emily, please stop. You know that Lorelai never does anything unless she wants to   no matter the consequences to anyone else.",3
LORELAI,What's that supposed to mean?,3
EMILY,"Lorelai wants to be with Christopher, she told us that at the wedding.",3
RICHARD,"Yes, and now the wind has changed.",3
LORELAI,Excuse me?,3
RICHARD,"Christopher is living up to his responsibilities as he tried to do many years ago with Lorelai, then she turned him down and turned him away.",3
LORELAI,I was sixteen.,3
RICHARD,"If Christopher has found someone who will actually allow him to be a father to his own child, then of course, that's what he's going to do.",3
EMILY,So you support this?,3
RICHARD,I understand this.,3
EMILY,I am appalled by your attitude.,3
RICHARD,"And I am shocked by your naïveté. Did you really expect this to work out? Did you really have pictures of Norman Rockwell family Christmases dancing in your head? Lorelai had her chance for a family, she walked away from it. That was her choice. He has a chance to be a father. I applaud him.",3
EMILY,Then you're an idiot.,3
RICHARD,"If you'll excuse me, I'm going into my study.",3
EMILY,,3
LUKE,We're closed.,3
LORELAI,"I know. Look, I didn't come here to make up, or to try to get you to forgive me, or talk. I wouldn't even have come here at all but I had a really crappy night and I really, really need a cup of coffee. Just pretend I'm not me. I'm Mimi, a new customer. I've never been in here before. I was just walking down the street and I spotted this place.  Ooh, hey, nice place.' And I came in. Now Mimi is going to pour herself a cup of coffee and sit over here way far away from you, and she promises, just as soon as she's done, she will rinse out her own cup and leave.",3
LORELAI,This is the second time I let myself do this.,3
LUKE,Do what?,3
LORELAI,Think I finally found it.,3
LUKE,Found what?,3
LORELAI,"Love, comfort, safety.",3
LUKE,Ah.,3
LORELAI,"I mean, first with Max, which of course, I screwed up, and then with Christopher, which of course, all the elements of the universe got together to screw up.",3
LUKE,"Yup, it's tough when the universe is against you. That's like taking on the Manhattan garbage union.",3
LORELAI,"I always thought if he could just get it together, grow up   maybe we could do it. Maybe we could really be a family, in the stupid, traditional  Dan Quayle, golden retriever, grow old together, wear matching jogging suits' kind of way. And then he did get it together   he became that guy. . . and he gets to be that guy with her. Chris is gonna have a baby with his girlfriend. He's gonna marry her. . .and he's gonna be there for her while she's pregnant and he's gonna be there with her while her child grows up, and he's gonna be there for her while she does. . . whatever it is she does. And I am in exactly the same place that I was in before.",3
LUKE,"Is that so bad? I mean, you got Rory.",3
LORELAI,"Yes, I do.",3
LUKE,"You got friends, you got a house, a job, apparently an iron stomach.",3
LORELAI,"No, it's not so bad. I'm lucky, I know. I just. . .I feel like I'm never gonna have it. . .the whole package, you know? That person, that couple life, and I swear, I hate admitting it because I fancy myself Wonder Woman, but. . .I really want it   the whole package.",3
LUKE,You'll get it.,3
LORELAI,How do you know?,3
LUKE,I know.,3
LORELAI,How do you know?,3
LUKE,"Because I know, okay? I know. Now eat your donut.",3
LORELAI,I'm really not very hungry.,3
LUKE,"Well, take it with you. You will be later.",3
LUKE,"Forget it, first time customers are on the house. Mimi, was it?",3
LORELAI,Yeah.,3
LUKE,"Come ag ain, Mimi.",3
LORELAI,,3
LORELAI,"Hey, you're home.",3
RORY,"Yup, I'm home.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the Lazy Hazy Crazy Days of Summer out of our heads   to sing the Small World song over and over for the next forty-eight hours. Of course, how we get the Small World song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet. Okay, see, that was not how that whole scene between us was supposed to go.",3
RORY,No?,3
LORELAI,"No. I mean, yes, I was surprised and I do think the basic sentiment of  make up your mind' was kind of called for.",3
RORY,Absolutely called for.,3
LORELAI,"But I didn't mean to upset you and yell at you and make you feel bad, I'm really sorry, hon.",3
RORY,"I know, but you were right.",3
LORELAI,"Ah, well, that's once, I guess.",3
RORY,So how was dinner?,3
LORELAI,So how was Dean?,3
RORY,So how was dinner?,3
LORELAI,So how was Dean?,3
RORY,"Ladies and Gentlemen, the Williams' sisters take center stage at Wimbledon once again.",3
LORELAI,Dinner was bad.,3
RORY,Sorry.,3
LORELAI,"That's okay, I knew it would be. Oh, but the good news is we can now go back to Luke's.",3
RORY,You made up! How did you make up?,3
LORELAI,"Well, I'm Mimi now.",3
RORY,"Oh, sure.",3
LORELAI,"So speaking of Dean, is there still a Dean?",3
RORY,"Yeah, there's still a Dean.",3
LORELAI,Really?,3
RORY,"I don't know what I was doing. Maybe it's because I haven't dated a lot but this Jess thing was crazy. And I do love Dean and you were absolutely right   I was treating him like dirt and I wasn't appreciating what was right in front of me, but I'm going to now.",3
LORELAI,"Rory, I don't want you to stay with Dean because of me.",3
RORY,I know.,3
LORELAI, Cause I was upset earlier.,3
RORY,I know.,3
LORELAI,I still have this Christopher thing bugging me and the pressure of tonight's dinner.,3
RORY,I know.,3
LORELAI,I didn't wanna upset you and I certainly don't want you to make an important decision off of  ,3
RORY,Mom.,3
LORELAI,Because it's too important  ,3
RORY,Mom.,3
LORELAI,And I just want you to be happy.,3
RORY,"Mom! All I did was think about what you said, that's all. Then I analyzed the situation.",3
LORELAI,,3
RORY,"You're mocking me, but yes, I did. And after all of this, I came to the conclusion that I want to make things good with Dean, and he deserves my undivided attention.",3
LORELAI,And you feel good about this?,3
RORY,I feel really good about this.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, because if you decided you really did wanna date Jess, I would help you. . .get vaccinated.",3
RORY,"Thank you, but I'm good.",3
LORELAI,"All right, as long as you're good.",3
RORY,I am good.,3
LORELAI,"Well, okay, good.",3
RORY,"What about you, are you good?",3
LORELAI,"Me? Well, I'm gonna be good.",3
RORY,Is there anything I can do to help?,3
LORELAI,Your existence is a huge help.,3
RORY,We're both gonna be good.,3
LORELAI,Yeah. I wonder if Christopher and Sherry's baby is going to look like me?,3
RORY,"Well, if the kid knows what's good for it, it absolutely will.",3

EMILY,"Yes, he is.",3
RORY,Business must be good.,3
EMILY,Seems to be.,3
RORY,"That's great. Isn't that great, Mom?",3
LORELAI,A jig is forthcoming.,3
RORY,"Mom's business is great, too. I mean, not that it's without its problem, you know, but they're usually funny problems. . .like, um. . .oh! Mom, why don't you tell Grandma about the mouse?",3
EMILY,What mouse?,3
RORY,Mom?,3
LORELAI,There's a mouse at the inn.,3
EMILY,Is the place dirty?,3
LORELAI,"No, it's just surrounded by this thing called nature and. . .mice happen.",3
EMILY,"Mice carry diseases, you know.",3
LORELAI,"It's a tiny little field mouse, Mom.",3
EMILY,"I don't care how big it is, it's still a rodent.",3
LORELAI,"Let's just change the subject, shall we?",3
EMILY,You should set a trap.,3
LORELAI,Got it covered.,3
Posted,10/13/02 17:36,3
EMILY,Just make sure you don't use poison.,3
LORELAI,Got it covered.,3
EMILY,"They will eat the poison and then go into the walls and die, decompose, and the entire place will smell.",3
LORELAI,"I've got it covered, but thanks.",3
EMILY,"I just have to say, I don't know why you're the one sitting here with an attitude. I'm the one who should be mad.",3
LORELAI,"Let's not do this, okay Mom?",3
EMILY,"After all, you're the one who just walked out of here last week without saying a word.",3
LORELAI,Because I couldn't get a word in.,3
EMILY,Your father and I were shocked and upset.,3
LORELAI,So what else is new?,3
EMILY,You didn't give us five minutes to digest the news.,3
LORELAI,"Please, find the off switch.",3
EMILY,You simply dumped it on us and walked out. I hardly think that's fair.,3
LORELAI,"Mom, it doesn't matter. It's over. Let's just move on, okay? We came here to have a nice evening, so. . .come on, let's have it.",3
RORY,Something smells good.,3
EMILY,Braised lamb shank.,3
RORY,"Oh, braised lamb shank! I love a lamb shank when it is braised.",3
LORELAI,Oh my God.,3
EMILY,"Reading in front of other people is extremely rude, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,Shauna Christy shot her husband.,3
EMILY,What?,3
LORELAI,"Shauna Christy, you rememb er Shauna Christy.",3
EMILY,"Yes, I rememb er Shauna Christy, she was a lovely girl.",3
LORELAI,"Well, apparently this lovely girl came home to find her husband giving the nanny a nice little bonus package. And they say good help is hard to find.",3
EMILY,That's just gossip.,3
LORELAI,Gossip? The man was shot thirty-five times. He looks like a sprinkler system.,3
EMILY,"I can't believe this. Shauna was always such a nice girl. She was bright, cultured, well- spoken.",3
LORELAI,And apparently a big Annie Oakley fan.,3
EMILY,"This is not funny, the woman commit ted a crime.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, fine.",3
EMILY,This is a tragedy.,3
LORELAI,"My bad, sorry.",3
EMILY,"A man is dead, a young woman ruined.",3
LORELAI,Consider the subject dropped.,3
EMILY,At least she had a husband to k*ll.,3
LORELAI,,3
RORY,Bless you.,3
LORELAI,"Thank you. Ugh, I hate having a cold.",3
RORY,I know you do.,3
LORELAI,"Ugh, it's bad enough being sick, but anybody can have a cold.",3
RORY,I know they can.,3
LORELAI,"I mean, I'd like to have a good illness, something different, impressive. Just once I'd like to be able to say, ""Yeah, I'm not feeling so good, my leg is haunted.""",3
RORY,"See, there's a reason why you only take one packet of TheraFlu at a time.",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",3
LUKE,"All right, pancakes, one fried egg, side of bacon. Chicken noodle soup, side of mashed potatoes.",3
RORY,"Thanks, Luke.",3

LUKE,It's the third day in a row you've ordered soup for breakfast.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, thanks for the tally.",3
LUKE,You know what helps get rid of a cold?,3
LORELAI,Endless vague questioning first thing in the morning?,3
LUKE,A healthy immune system.,3
LORELAI,My second guess.,3
LUKE,And you know how you get a healthy immune system?,3
LORELAI,"Rememb er when you hated me? That was fun, wasn't it?",3
LUKE,Is it eating nothing but crap all day and blowing out your brain cells with coffee?,3
RORY,No.,3
LUKE,"That's right, no.",3
LORELAI,Why are you helping him?,3
RORY,No seemed like the right answer.,3
LUKE,"Eat a vegetable now and then, maybe some high fiber cereal in the morning.",3
LORELAI,"Listen, Grandpa, my soup's getting cold.",3
LUKE,"At least eat the carrots in the soup this time, not just the noodles.",3
LORELAI,I promise.,3
LORELAI,Eat my carrots.,3

SHANE,Okay.,3

DEAN,"Okay, so, uh, please don't hate me, but I already ate breakfast.",3
RORY,"See, nice full sentences.",3
DEAN,What?,3
LORELAI,,3
LORELAI,You're sure?,3
MICHELorelai,Positive. It ran right across the lobby and into the fireplace.,3
LORELAI,I don't see it.,3
MICHELorelai,"Well, it must've found a hole to crawl into.",3
LORELAI,We cannot have this mouse running around the inn. Customers will freak.,3
MICHELorelai,"Well, tell them it's a baby. People love babies. They'll talk to it in funny voices.",3
LORELAI,Did you call an exterminator?,3
MICHELorelai,"Why, no, what a wonderful idea. I was actually going to fasten a large wedge of cheese to my head and lay on the ground until Mickey gets hungry and decides to crawl out and snack on my face.",3
LORELAI,When does he get here?,3
MICHELorelai,He said we were the first stop.,3
LORELAI,What do we do until them?,3
MICHELorelai,Make cat sounds?,3

LORELAI,"Oh, hey Kirk. Hold on a sec. Just stand here and make sure it doesn't come out.",3
MICHELorelai,"Oh, goody, a promotion.",3
LORELAI,Hi Kirk. What can I do for ya?,3
KIRK,I have a delivery for Sookie.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, well, anything good?",3
KIRK,"No, just some w edding photos.",3
LORELAI,"Great. Well, she stepped out for a minute, but I'll take them to her. I swear, I'll give them to her. If you want, I'll leave and find her and then I'll give them to her.",3
KIRK,"No, that won't be necessary.",3

KIRK,"Uh, Lorelai, can I speak to you for a moment?",3
LORELAI,"Oh, sure.",3
KIRK,Could we sit?,3
LORELAI,"Sit. . .sure, let's sit. Is everything okay?",3
KIRK,Okay?,3
LORELAI,Yes.,3
KIRK,With me?,3
LORELAI,Yes.,3
KIRK,"Well, my mother has developed a condition   makes her knees enormous. Yesterday I spent all morning cutting holes in her pants so she could sit, but other than that and the dyspeptic parrot problem, everything is fine.",3
LORELAI,"Well, good, I'm glad. Okay, well, um, I'm gonna  ",3
KIRK,I was just wondering . . .,3
LORELAI,Yes. . .wondering what?,3
KIRK,"We've known each other for a good amount of time now. Our, uh, paths have crossed professionally and socially a number of times, all with relatively pleasant results, and well, I was just wondering if you would like to have dinner with me?",3
LORELAI,Oh.,3
KIRK,In two weeks.,3
LORELAI,Two weeks?,3
KIRK,I heard you have a cold. I think two weeks is enough time to ensure the virus is out of your system.,3
LORELAI,"Well, Kirk, I  ",3
KIRK,You don't have to answer me right away. I know that this is completely out of the blue for you. Take a few days and think about it.,3
LORELAI,"Kirk, wait.",3
KIRK,"By the way, I think you might be the prettiest girl I've ever seen. . .outside of a really filthy magazine.",3
LORELAI,Thank you.,3
LORELAI,Don't.,3
MICHELorelai,,3
RORY,How long have you been sitting there?,3
LORELAI,Not long. An hour. . .and a half.,3
RORY,Why?,3
LORELAI,Because.,3
RORY, Cause why?,3
LORELAI,Because today is the last first day of high school you're ever gonna have.,3
RORY,You're insane.,3
LORELAI,"I'm not insane, I'm just sentimental, and you're grown.",3
RORY,I'm not grown.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, you are, you're all grown up and soon you'll be going off into the world.",3
RORY,Not yet.,3
LORELAI,"But soon. And after you spread those wings and fly away, I won't have the opportunity to give you this.",3
RORY,What is it?,3
LORELAI,It's your bill.,3
RORY,My what?,3
LORELAI,"Yeah. I've been crunching the numbers, you know, adding up what you've cost me over the years   raising you, clothing you, feeding you, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.",3
RORY,Mmhmm.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, I've itemized everything here by years and income ratio. I thought you could factor it into your student loan.",3
RORY,Oh boy.,3
LORELAI,One thing that's painfully obvious here   you've used an extraordinary number of diapers.,3
RORY,I'm gonna go take a shower.,3
LORELAI,"Really, it's cost a fortune. What were you using all those diapers for?",3
RORY,I was building my  make Mommy go away' castle.,3
LORELAI,"All right, you got home too late last night and I didn't get a chance to talk to you.",3
RORY,I got home at ten and you were already asleep.,3
LORELAI,"Well, I was trying to watch The Legend of Bagger Vance again.",3
RORY,"Okay, what did I miss?",3
LORELAI,Okay. Kirk asked me out.,3
RORY,Shut up!,3
LORELAI,Yesterday he came to the inn and asked me to dinner.,3
RORY,That's so sweet.,3
LORELAI,Sweet?,3
RORY,You should wear your dress with the ponies on it. I bet he likes ponies.,3
LORELAI,"Rory, I cannot go out with Kirk.",3
RORY,Why?,3
LORELAI,Uh huh. . .why? He's. . .he's Kirk!,3
RORY,"Well, as long as he loves you.",3
LORELAI,You are not serious.,3
RORY,I just want you to be happy.,3
LORELAI,"""Hello Headmaster Charleston, this is my stepfather Kirk. Please don't make any sudden movements, he's a fear biter.""",3
RORY,"Okay, so how will you let him down?",3
LORELAI,"I don't know. That's why I needed to talk to you, you're the nice one in the family.",3
RORY,"Well, you could just tell him the truth. You could tell him that you're not interested in dating him and that you just wanna be friends.",3
LORELAI,That sounds so lame.,3
RORY,You could tell him you're involved with someone.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, because my current karma is so great in that area, I can really afford to jinx it with that kind of lie   no!",3
RORY,"Okay, then you figure it out.",3
LORELAI,All right. . .we're gonna have to move.,3
RORY,Okay.,3
LORELAI,"Take off in the middle of the night, leave everything behind, assume different identities. I'll join a local community theater and I'll drive you to soccer. It'll work for many years until the FBI comes to get me, and by that time, you're on your own.",3
RORY,I don't play soccer.,3
LORELAI,You do now.,3
LORELAI,Stop!,3
RORY,It's funny.,3
LORELAI,"It's not funny, it's bad! I have to see this guy. He works at every business in town, I can't get away from him!",3
RORY,"Well, then you should marry him and move in with his mother.",3
LORELAI,"I'll handle it myself, thank you very much.",3
RORY,"Sorry, just trying to help.",3
LORELAI,So you have your swearing in ceremony today.,3
RORY,"At three, do not be late.",3
LORELAI,I will not be late.,3
RORY,"Okay, I have something to tell you.",3
LORELAI,Is it about Vince Foster?,3
RORY,It's about Grandma.,3
LORELAI,Oops.,3
RORY,She's coming today.,3
LORELAI,No!,3
RORY,"Mom, I'm sorry. She found out about it, she called. . .",3
LORELAI,And you said yes?,3
RORY,She's my grandmother.,3
LORELAI,So?,3
RORY,So what am I supposed to say?,3
LORELAI,"Say ""Sorry, Grandma, but if my mother sees you, she'll run screaming down the hall.""",3
RORY,"You'll be sitting there listening to the ceremony, you hardly have to talk at all.",3
LORELAI,Rory.,3
RORY,"Hey, we are family.",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, well, look how great that worked out for Sister Sledge.",3
RORY,I'm gonna go take a shower. You'll be pouting out here when I'm done?,3
LORELAI,"No, I gotta go to work. I'll see you this afternoon.",3
RORY,At three.,3
LORELAI,"There goes my little vice president, off to rule the world.",3
RORY,"Well, Paris will be ruling the world. I will be holding her keys.",3
LORELAI,I'm still proud of you.,3
RORY,I appreciate it.,3
LORELAI,"Honey, you have power, brains, now all you need is a dimwitted, drunken or drug- addicted relative to constantly humiliate you while you serve in office.",3
RORY,Will you work on that for me?,3
LORELAI,,3
LORELAI,"Ah, time?",3
RORY,3:01.,3
LORELAI,"No, oh man, not fair, stupid traffic lights!",3
RORY,"That's okay, it doesn't start  til 3:15.",3
LORELAI,But I so tried to . . . you lied to me.,3
RORY,Did I?,3
LORELAI,"You said it was at three, and it's at three-fifteen.",3
RORY,"Well, I guess I did.",3
LORELAI,"Ah! That's it, I'm standing up in the middle of your speech and demanding a recount.",3
RORY,Shall we seat you?,3
LORELAI,"Betrayed, lied to and humiliated.",3
RORY,"Well, get used to it   I am in politics now.",3
LORELAI,"Hey, where's, uh. . .",3
RORY,She's not here yet.,3
LORELAI,"You told her the real time, didn't you?",3
RORY,"Well, Grandma can handle structure. How's this?",3
LORELAI,Fine.,3
RORY,"Okay, great. You can sit there and you can put your purse on that chair to save it for Grandma.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, great idea.",3
RORY,Mom.,3
LORELAI,"Fine, yeah, saving the seat. There, all saved.",3
RORY,"Thank you. Now, I'll meet right outside afterwards, okay?",3
LORELAI,Okay. I just want you to remembe r three things while you're sitting up,3
there,"I love you, you're the greatest kid in the world, and you're in a skirt, keep your knees closed.",3
RORY,Bye.,3
LORELAI,"Hey, this is good advice. When I was in school, Linda Lee was class treasurer and she could not keep her knees closed if they were magnetized. Hanes should've given her an endorsement deal.",3
EMILY,Lorelai!,3
LORELAI,Hi Mom.,3
EMILY,"You could've put your handbag there to save my seat, you know.",3
HEADMASTERory,"Ladies and Gentlemen, I welcome you. Assemblies like this are always happy ones for me, initiating in a new group of school leaders. Chilton's always prided itself on the quality of its student government, and this year we may have outdone ourselves. These young men and women up on this stage represent the best and the brightest of what this school has to offer. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to present to you your student body government of 2003.",3
RORY,". . .a larger awareness of the world around us. Problems that not only face us here at school but will face us when we leave school, and more importantly, will face the next generation that follows us. We must learn that our actions have consequences, that someone else will have to clean up our mess. We need to figure out how to make that mess a little smaller. If a small fraction of these things can be accomplished this year, then I will feel like our administration has done its job. Thank you.",3
PARIS,"In the past, all great empires have fallen. The feeling seems to be that it's inevitable   that something like what the Romans built could not last. Maybe they're right. Maybe there is no way of keeping something that big and prosperous permanently. Maybe there is no way of keeping our legacy from becoming obsolete. Well, I intend to fly in the face of such thinking, and damn it, I will succeed. I certainly don't wanna come back here twenty years from now on Alumni's Night and find this place turned into a high priced charm school, pink and white with big cheerleading megaphones painted on the walls. I wouldn't be able to take it. I would have to dismantle the place stone by stone with my bare hands. . . ALL STUDENTS ON",3
STAGE,"I have faith in the Chilton Handbook, so let it be forever.",3
HEADMASTERory,,3
EMILY,Is Rory coming out?,3
LORELAI,That's what she said. It was a nice ceremony.,3
EMILY,"Yes, it was.",3
LORELAI,Long.,3
EMILY,Very long.,3
LORELAI,The longest.,3
EMILY,Lorelai  ,3
RORY,Hey. You're both here.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, we're here.",3
EMILY,"Of course we're here. We wouldn't have missed it for the world. You looked wonderful up there, Rory.",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, good job with the knees.",3
RORY,"Thank you. I'm gonna run to my locker and get my backpack, then we can go.",3
LORELAI,I'll be here.,3
RORY,Bye Grandma.,3
LORELAI,"You know, you don't have to wait, Mom, if you have things to do.",3
EMILY,"Oh. . .well, all right. Lorelai, I was wondering if we could have lunch.",3
LORELAI,Lunch?,3
EMILY,"Yes, just the two of us.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, well  ",3
EMILY,Tomorrow would be good for me.,3
LORELAI,"Tomorrow, lunch tomorrow, lunch with you tomorrow. . .",3
EMILY,We can do it anywhere you'd like. Perhaps at that Luke's Diner you two seem to love so much.,3
LORELAI,"Lunch   at Luke's   with you? Wow, I can't even put the visual together.",3
EMILY,I can meet you there at one.,3
LORELAI,One? Well  ,3
EMILY,"If one isn't good, you pick a time. I'll make it work.",3
LORELAI,All right. One o'clock at Luke's.,3
EMILY,,3
PARIS,"Look, let's face it, the last administration might have just as well been running around yelling  Toga!' for all the brilliant things they accomplished. But this year   everything changes, starting with the library. It's completely out of proportion with its subjects. I mean, there's five hundred volumes on the French Revolution, yet only three on the Crusades. How do they expect usto get a decent education with inferior resources like that? Huh, seems like the hour's almost up. Okay, well, I think this has been an extremely successful first gathering. I appreciate all the class presidents coming and being on time. So before I adjourn this meeting, is there anything anyone would like to say?",3
RORY,People's names might have been nice.,3
FRANCIE,"Actually, I have something I'd like to put on the table to be discussed.",3
PARIS,"Oh, okay. Well, we only have a couple of minutes, so give us the Reader's Digest version.",3
FRANCIE,"As president of the senior class, a certain problem has been brought to my attention. For the past thirty years, the Chilton regulations have stated that skirts must be no higher than three- quarters of an inch above the knee, that's it. Any higher, the student gets written up. I propose to put to an immed iate vote an amendment to raise hemlines an additional inch and a half.",3
PARIS,Hemlines?,3
FRANCIE,That's right.,3
PARIS,That's the major issue on the senior class' mind?,3
FRANCIE,"It's one of the major issues, yes.",3
PARIS,"Well, okay   thank you, Francie, for giving us something really important to mull over here. I anticipate a lot of sleepless nights for many of the people in this room. I will take that under advisement and get back to you as soon as I can.",3
FRANCIE,"Oh, okay, fine. Thanks.",3
PARIS,"Now, if that's it, I officially call the first meeting of the Chilton student body presidents to a close. I'll see you all Friday.",3
GIRLorelai,What idiot gave her a gavel?,3
RORY,"Okay, see, the whole point of having an informal  get to know you' gathering was actually to have an informal  get to know you' gathering.",3
PARIS,What's your point?,3
RORY,You just spent an hour walking around talking about your agenda.,3
PARIS,I'm student body president   that's my job.,3
RORY,"But we got donuts, and we didn't touch the donuts. The donuts are still sitting next to the coffee that we never passed out. We were supposed to spend this time to talk, bond, get to know each other.",3
PARIS,"Geez, Rory, we've been sitting in a room together for sixty minutes   what else do you want, a ring?",3
FRANCIE,"Hi. Excuse me, Paris? I just wanted to say on behalf of the entire senior class, congratulations on your win and I'm really looking forward to working very closely with you this year.",3
PARIS,Thanks.,3
FRANCIE,Okay. See you later. Bye Rory. You two are gonna make a great team.,3
PARIS,"Yes, the jerseys are coming on Friday. Okay, I'm gonna drop the demand for the librarian's resignation tonight. You wanna read it before I send it?",3
RORY,Are you sure the first thing you wanna do in office is to get a ninety-three year old woman sacked?,3
PARIS,"Hey, at least I'm not putting her on an iceberg and shoving her off to sea, which considering the fact that you can't find the Shakespeare section without psychic powers yet the Cliffs Notes rack practically smacks you in the face on the way in, is totally justified.",3
RORY,,3
SOOKIE,"Okay, I just got a message that a vegetarian menu was requested for tonight.",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, Lasano's, party of five at eight o'clock.",3
SOOKIE,I thought you said you weren't gonna let vegetarians in here anymore.,3
LORELAI,"No, you said you weren't gonna let vegetarians in here anymore.",3
SOOKIE,But I'm mak ing my baked stuffed pork chops for tonight.,3
LORELAI,"Well, make them for the other guests and make something else for the Lasano's.",3
SOOKIE,Like what?,3
LORELAI,"I don't know. Pasta, you make great pasta.",3
SOOKIE,"But that's boring, anyone can make pasta. I'm an artist. You don't dictate to an artist, you don't tell him what to do. I mean, no ever walked up to Degas and said, ""Hey, pal, easy with the dancers, enough already. Draw a nice fruit bowl once in awhile, will ya?""",3
LORELAI,"A great artist can make art out of anything, including pasta.",3
SOOKIE,"Fine, pasta, whoo.",3
LORELAI,Is there coffee?,3
SOOKIE,Just made some.,3
LORELAI,Great.,3
SOOKIE,So today's your lunch with Emily.,3
LORELAI,Yup.,3
SOOKIE,Any idea what she's gonna say?,3
LORELAI,"No, but I bet it's not, ""I'm joining the circus, feed your father until I get back."" I should just cancel.",3
SOOKIE,"You can't cancel, you're meet ing her in an hour.",3
LORELAI,"I know, but this goes against every rule I have in the Gilmore survival guide. Number one   no running with scissors. Number two   no pageboy haircuts. Number three   never ever have lunch alone with a mother.",3
SOOKIE,It might not be so bad.,3
LORELAI,"Saying yes to this lunch with my mother is like saying ""Sounds fun!"" to a ride with Clemenza.",3
SOOKIE,"Think good thoughts, she could surprise you.",3
LORELAI,I guess.,3
SOOKIE,"People change, you know. They do it every day. I mean, one minute you could be. . .oh, let's say a vegetarian, and the next minute you could accidentally have a bite of a stuffed pork chop that changes your entire way of thinking.",3
LORELAI,Sookie.,3
SOOKIE,"Oh, suddenly life's fun, suddenly there's a reason to get up in the morning   it's called bacon!",3
LORELAI,Forget it.,3
SOOKIE,Come on!,3
LORELAI,Pasta.,3
SOOKIE,,3
FRANCIE,"Rory, hi, nice of you to join us.",3
RORY,"Francie, what  ",3
FRANCIE,"No, I talk, okay? Great. Now let's discuss Paris.",3
RORY,What about her?,3
FRANCIE,"She seems to have the very strange idea that she's actually in charge around here, and I thought it'd be good if I let you in on a little secret. . .she's not.",3
RORY,Why don't you tell her this yourself?,3
FRANCIE,"Because talking to Paris is like shopping for a bathing suit in December   frustrating, fruitless, and a complete waste of time. Now, you, you might be the wallflower, but you're obviously the Meyer Lansky behind this organization.",3
RORY,I am not the Meyer Lansky.,3
FRANCIE,"What's that noise? What is that noise? Oh wait, it's me, still talking. Didn't you hear it? Obviously not. Anyhow, Paris is student body president   big fat deal. There are three other class presidents   the junior class president, the sophomore class president, and oh, yes, the senior class president   me.",3
RORY,I know all this.,3
FRANCIE,"Well, then, it's off the short bus for you, isn't it? Now if Paris thinks she's gonna march around dictating mandates and ignoring what I have to say, then she's in for a major bikini wax.",3
RORY,Thanks for the visual.,3
FRANCIE,"Without me, she's nothing. Just another power mad, insecure, friendless, dateless, highlight-less loser wandering around trying to make someone care that they exist at all, which, by the way, no one does. I control the senior class. I am also the leader of the Puffs, the most exclusive society on this campus, and I have the power to make her life a living hell.",3
RORY,"Francie, she's just  ",3
FRANCIE,I can make sure she does nothing this year but lead the student body in whatever version of the Pledge of Allegiance happens to be constitutional at the time.,3
RORY,What do you want me to do about it?,3
FRANCIE,"I want you to go back to Margaret Thatcher and tell her to play ball. She's gonna support the hemline issue, and any other issue that I bring up for the rest of the year. Otherwise I'll make her so ineffectual, she'll make Jimmy Carter look like Martin Sheen   do you get me?",3
RORY,"We're supposed to be representing the interests of the student body. We are not supposed to be brokering backdoor deals and pushing through agendas with intimidation and bribery. I mean, what are we, French skating judges?",3
FRANCIE,"Wise up, Goldilocks.",3
RORY,My hair's brown.,3
FRANCIE,"This is politics. If you've got a problem, tell it to Noam Chomsky. I live in the real world, now blow. Oh, and I would keep this conversation between you and me. Paris tends to get a little paranoid when there's other mammal s at the watering hole, so her finding out that you were conferring with me mig ht not make your vice presidency any easier.",3
RORY,I am not conferring with you. A hand came out of the bathroom and pulled me in.,3
FRANCIE,,3
LUKE,What the hell are you doing here?,3
LORELAI,"Ah, I came for the warmth.",3
LUKE,"Well, you're just not usually here this time of day, that's all.",3
LORELAI,"Well, I'm meet ing someone for lunch.",3
LUKE,"Oh, Kirk?",3
LORELAI,What?,3
LUKE,You're meet ing Kirk?,3
LORELAI,Why would you say that?,3
LUKE,"Well, I know he asked you out so I just assumed.",3
LORELAI,How do you know he asked me out?,3
LUKE,He told me.,3
LORELAI,He told you?,3
LUKE,Yesterday.,3
LORELAI,Oh my God.,3
LUKE,"Hey, relax, I think it's great.",3
LORELAI,"Why, why would he tell you?",3
LUKE,"Well, actually, he came to me for a little advice.",3
LORELAI,About what?,3
LUKE,"About whether or not I thought he had a shot with you. After all, I know ya, I've been to your house, I know whether or not you have stain resistant rugs.",3
LORELAI,I'm lying down now.,3
LUKE,"When he found out you had wood floors, he seemed very pleased.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, Luke.",3
LUKE,"I told him you like movies and junk food, and of course, talking incessantly, but we both agreed that there's nothing like some good lovin' to shut a person up, if you know what I mean.",3
LORELAI,"I'm sorry, can you bring me a s harper fork? I'm not sure this one will go all the way through your hand.",3
LUKE,"Okay, now, I know it's new so you probably don't wanna jinx it, so I won't talk about itanymore. But I have to tell you, seeing that guy's face when he was talking about you. . .he almost had an expression.",3
LORELAI,"Far, far away from me.",3
LUKE,Love is in the air.,3
LORELAI,Ha!,3
EMILY,Why are you throwing cutlery in a public place?,3
LORELAI,"Uh,  cause I feel stupid doing it at home?",3
EMILY,"I'm sorry I'm late, there was a little traffic on the way. Perhaps had I been on time, there would still be the possibility of soup.",3
LORELAI,"I haven't been here that long. See, I still have a knife.",3
EMILY,I'm glad to hear it.,3
LORELAI,"So, you gonna sit?",3
EMILY,"Oh, yes, of course. There we go. Well, this is nice. You certainly can see the whole town from here, can't you?",3
LORELAI,"Yes, you can.",3
EMILY,"I can see why you come here so much. It must be fun to just sit and people-watch. Well, let's see what they've got, shall we? Oh, Caesar salad   is that good here?",3
LORELAI,"Uh, I'm sure it is.",3
EMILY,You've never had it?,3
LORELAI,No.,3
EMILY,Has Rory?,3
LORELAI,No.,3
EMILY,"Oh. Well, Caesar salads can be extremely unsafe if they use bad eggs.",3
LORELAI,Get something else.,3
EMILY,"Of course, if they're coddled, it would be fine. Do you know if they coddle the eggs here?",3
LORELAI,I have no idea.,3
EMILY,You don't know? You come here every day.,3
LORELAI,Why don't you ask Luke if they're coddled?,3
EMILY,"Oh, he'll just say they are. I'll have a Cobb salad. What are you going to have?",3
LORELAI,A Caesar salad with extra uncoddled eggs on the side.,3
EMILY,"Really, Lorelai, would a serious answer once in awhile k*ll you?",3
LORELAI,"Sorry, Mom. Uh, honestly, I'm a little confused.",3
EMILY,About what?,3
LORELAI,About this.,3
EMILY,What's confusing? We're having lunch.,3
LORELAI,"I know we're having lunch, but we don't usually have lunch, especially not in my town at Luke's Diner.",3
EMILY,"I just figured you had to work, it'd be easier on you this way.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, that's fine, if I  ",3
LUKE,You two ready to order?,3
EMILY,Yes. How is your Caesar salad dressing prepared?,3
LUKE,I'll have to call Paul Newman and ask him.,3
EMILY,A Cobb salad and an iced tea.,3
LORELAI,"Cheeseburger, fries, onion rings and a cherry coke.",3
LUKE,Any pie today?,3
LORELAI,"Hm, no thanks.",3
LUKE,"Cutting back a little, huh? Trying to look good for the big day. Smart, very smart.",3
LORELAI,Make sure you check that frying oil with your face.,3
EMILY,What was that all about?,3
LORELAI,"Ah, nothing, just a little small town charm. Now, please, Mom, tell me   why did you ask me to lunch?",3
EMILY,Because I wanted to spend some time alone with my daughter.,3
LORELAI,Mom.,3
EMILY,"Well, Rory drops by after school every now and then, so we see her alone.",3
LORELAI,Mom.,3
EMILY,"But we never see you alone. . .unless Rory leaves the room for a second, and even then you try to go with her. If I had a nickel for every time you've used the  Girls always go to the bathroom together, Mom' line, I'd be a very rich woman.",3
LORELAI,"You are a very rich woman. Mom, please, is this really a  me and you' lunch? No hidden agenda?",3
EMILY,Of course not.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, fine.",3
EMILY,I talked to Christopher.,3
LORELAI,What?,3
EMILY,"I called him last week, we talked for a very long time, and I have to tell you, he is not in love with that woman.",3
LORELAI,Oh my God.,3
EMILY,"He never came out and said it, but I could tell from his voice. He would much rather be with you and Rory.",3
LORELAI,Are you out of your mind?,3
EMILY,I think you need to talk to him.,3
LORELAI,And that would be a yes.,3
EMILY,"All he needs is to hear that you want this, too.",3
LORELAI,"Mom, what the hell are you doing calling Christopher?",3
EMILY,"Well, somebody had to.",3
LORELAI,"No, somebody didn't have to!",3
EMILY,"Oh, I certainly wasn't going to just sit by and watch this situation explode. You two belong together. It took you years to figure that out, and now that you finally have it, you can't let it go away just because of a little complication.",3
LORELAI,"Mom, his girlfriend is pregnant   that is more than a little complication.",3
EMILY,"Women have gotten pregnant since the beginning of time, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,"And before I result to the totally called for duh, please tell me what your point it.",3
EMILY,This woman is trying to trap him. Don't you see that? You can't let that happen.,3
LORELAI,"Mom, this is none of your business.",3
EMILY,"Yes, it is! It affects Rory, it affects you   both of whom are my business.",3
LORELAI,"Do not get involved in this, I mean it. Butt out! Don't call Christopher and talk about me or us, just stay out of it!",3
EMILY,Where are you going?,3
LORELAI,I have to get back to the inn.,3
EMILY,Do not walk out on me.,3
LORELAI,"Mom, I am not gonna discuss this with you now or ever. I would love for you to respect that but I know you, so give Christopher my love.",3
EMILY,,3
PARIS,"So as soon as she gets out of intensive care, we'll get her signature, and then we can finally set about hiring a new librarian. Anything else?",3
LOUISE,"Yes. Uh, I was thinking that maybe this year we should throw a little beginning of the school year dance. I mean, why wait until the tan fades to have a formal?",3
PARIS,Dances are distracting.,3
LOUISE,Dances help bring in money to pay for those stupid topiaries you want in the quad.,3
PARIS,Draft a proposal and have it on my desk by tomorrow. Madeline?,3
MADELINE,"I would like to explore the option of having a professional photographer take the senior class photos. Every year we use that cheesy picture place, and every year people wind up with those VH1  Before They Were Stars' pictures, and I for one would like to stop the humiliation now.",3
PARIS,How are we going to get a professional photographer?,3
LOUISE,Helmett Newton is my godfather.,3
PARIS,"Okay, sign him up   and tell him to leave the whips and chains at home. All right, I think that's all we have time for today.",3
FRANCIE,"Um, excuse me, Paris? I was just wondering if you had time to think about my proposal?",3
PARIS,What proposal?,3
FRANCIE,"You know, the higher hemlines.",3
PARIS,"Oh right. No, not yet.",3
FRANCIE,"Okay, I guess I can wait. . . for awhile.",3
PARIS,Patience is a virtue.,3
RORY,Hey.,3
PARIS,"What do you think about Helmett Newton being Louise's godfather? Explains a lot, doesn't it?",3
RORY,"Yeah. Listen, I think it might be a good idea to consider getting behind this hemline issue.",3
PARIS,"You're kidding, right?",3
RORY,"No. I mean, if girls want the option of making their skirts a little shorter, then who cares, right?",3
PARIS,"I care. I'm building a legacy here, Rory. You want the first stand I make against the faculty to involve a fashion choice? It would be my  gays in the military.'",3
RORY,I just think it would be really smart to establish some goodwill among the other class presidents.,3
PARIS,Why?,3
RORY,"Because you have to work with them, and you might even need their support on something in the future. And throwing them a tiny bone like a hemline amendment is no big deal.",3
PARIS,I don't know.,3
RORY,"Look, it's right at the beginning of your term. No one will even remember the first stupid thing that you passed. You have plenty of time to establish your legacy. I mean it. By the time that you implement public executions for line cutters, hemlines will be a thing of the past. I was making a joke not a suggestion.",3
PARIS,Why do you care?,3
RORY,What?,3
PARIS,Why do you care? You seem very invested in this whole thing   why?,3
RORY,"Hey, I'm not invested in this thing. If you don't wanna do it, fine. I'm just giving you my opinion. I just thought you might wanna be one of those presidents that's beloved as well as respected.",3
PARIS,Raising hemlines would make me beloved?,3
RORY,It's certainly a step in that direction.,3
PARIS,"All right, I'll push it through.",3
RORY,Good.,3
PARIS,,3
LORELAI,"Ugh, I'm not going.",3
RORY,You are going.,3
LORELAI,"She has done this to me for the last time. From now on, I'm not giving her any information about my life at all.",3
RORY,As opposed to all the details you've heaped upon her in the past.,3
LORELAI,I can't believe she called Christopher. She has no respect for me or my feelings or my privacy.,3
RORY,"Well, she didn't think of it that way. She thought that she was helping.",3
LORELAI,"You do know there isn't a Santa Claus, don't you?",3
RORY,Please just try to forget this.,3
LORELAI,I'm never ever going over there again.,3
RORY,Not an option.,3
LORELAI,It should be. Sometimes you have to cut people out of your life.,3
RORY,She's your mother.,3
LORELAI,"I want proof, I want tests done.",3
RORY,Do you want your red purse or your blue?,3
LORELAI,"Blue. Gee, I wonder who else she's calling. She's probably on the phone to Kirk right now. ""I heard through my spies you're taking my daughter out to dinner. Let's talk China patterns."" God, I'm furious! Don't get that, it might be her.",3
RORY,"Well, I doubt she'd call when we're supposed to be over in half an hour.",3
KIRK,Hello? Hello?,3
LORELAI,The answering machine confused him.,3
RORY,Yeah.,3
LORELAI,And that's the guy who likes me.,3
RORY,I'd consider adoption if I were you.,3
LORELAI,"My life stinks. Hey, let's look into each other's eyes and say ""I wish I were you"" at exactly the same time   maybe we'll pull a Freaky Friday!",3
RORY,Or we can just pretend that we did and you can go around acting really immature. Oh wait. . .,3
LORELAI,I can't believe you won't switch bodies with me.,3
RORY,Forget it. Then I'd have to date Kirk.,3
LORELAI,I would switch bodies with you in a heartbeat if you wanted.,3
RORY,"I know, and I appreciate that.",3
KIRK,"Lorelai, hi. I just called, I think there might be a problem with your phone.",3
LORELAI,Oh my God.,3
KIRK,I was just wondering if I could ask you. . .,3
LORELAI,Let's go.,3
KIRK,. . .a couple of quick questions   KIRK'S,3
MOM,Hello?,3
KIRK,Mom? KIRK'S,3
MOM,Who is this?,3
KIRK,"Mom, would you please get off the phone? Mom? KIRK'S",3
MOM,Is this Dr. Marshall?,3
KIRK,,3
EMILY,"Oh, for heaven's sake.",3
LORELAI,"Hey, I don't think your doorbell's working.",3
EMILY,"Believe me, it's not the doorbell.",3
MAID,"Oh, so it was the door.",3
EMILY,"Yes, Sarah, once again, it was the door.",3
SARAH,"Okay, so I just have to rememb er that the really big bell is the door and the small one is the oven.",3
EMILY,"Yes, that would be a wonderful thing to remember.",3
EMILY,"Okay, well, let's have a drink, shall we?",3
RORY,"So, Grandma, you have a new maid?",3
EMILY,"Yes, I do.",3
LORELAI,"Well, good thing we're in time for happy hour.",3
EMILY,"Wine, Lorelai?",3
LORELAI,"Uh, yeah, if there's any left.",3
EMILY,Rory   soda or water?,3
RORY,"Uh, soda please.",3
EMILY,How about water?,3
RORY,"Water's fine, too.",3
LORELAI,"What's up, Mom?",3
EMILY,Nothing.,3
LORELAI,You seem tense.,3
EMILY,You always think I seem tense.,3
LORELAI,But tonight you seem tenser than usual.,3
EMILY,"Well, I'm not! Rory, tell me ab out school",3
RORY,"Oh, okay, um. . .school's good.",3
EMILY,Do you like student government?,3
RORY,I think so.,3
EMILY,And your grades are still good?,3
RORY,Yes.,3
EMILY,Do you take any sort of physical education?,3
RORY,Not this semester.,3
EMILY,But eventually you will take some sort of physical education?,3
RORY,I'm not sure.,3
LORELAI,"But trust me   the minute she decides to run after a ball and take a public shower with thirty other girls, you are getting a call.",3
EMILY,"Well, thank you.",3
SARAH,Dinner's ready!,3
EMILY,"Sarah, one minute please.",3
SARAH,Yeah?,3
EMILY,"I told you we eat dinner at seven. . .and right now, it's six-thirty. Therefore, one could conclude that maybe it's just a tad early for dinner.",3
SARAH,"Oh, I'm sorry, I -",3
EMILY,We want to eat at seven!,3
SARAH,But the food's ready now.,3
EMILY,"Okay, never mind, we'll eat. We're eating. Up, up, let's go. It's fine. It's better   then we can all be in bed by nine. Sit down.",3
LORELAI,"Mom, tell us what is up right now.",3
EMILY,What is up with what?,3
LORELAI,"With you, with her, with you and her.",3
EMILY,"Well, she's new, Lorelai. She's only been here three days, she's still getting the hang of things. I think it's only fair to give the woman a chance. Why are you staring at me?",3
LORELAI,"Mom, you've had maids deported who were better than her.",3
EMILY,I have not.,3
LORELAI,Talk.,3
EMILY,Your father made a crack the other day about my not being able to keep a maid.,3
LORELAI,Ah.,3
EMILY,"Of course, it's a gross exaggeration. Yes, I've had maids I haven't liked, but I've also had maids I've loved.",3
LORELAI,Name one.,3
EMILY,Daiha.,3
LORELAI,Who?,3
EMILY,"You rememb er, she took you shopping once.",3
LORELAI,How old was I?,3
EMILY,I don't know.,3
LORELAI,Guess.,3
EMILY,"Four, five.",3
LORELAI,"Mom, you haven't liked a maid since I was four or five?",3
EMILY,I have liked a maid; you asked me whom I loved. I loved Daiha.,3
LORELAI,And whatever happened to Daiha?,3
EMILY,"Oh, how should I know? But I loved her.",3
SARAH,"Okay, so salad?",3
EMILY,"Thank you, Sarah.",3
SARAH,"Oops, big bell.",3
EMILY,"Sarah, the salad! Sarah! Pass the wine, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,You want a straw with that?,3
EMILY,You're enjoying this?,3
LORELAI,Well. . .yeah.,3
CHRISTOPHERory,"Lor, I need to talk to you.",3
LORELAI,"Chris, what are you doing here?",3
CHRISTOPHERory,You won't return my calls!,3
LORELAI,Did you do this?,3
CHRISTOPHERory,I knew you'd be here.,3
EMILY,I did not do this.,3
CHRISTOPHERory,You gave me no choice.,3
LORELAI,After I told you to just stay out of it!,3
EMILY,"Lorelai, I did not do this!",3
LORELAI,You have to go.,3
CHRISTOPHERory,I'm not going until you talk to me.,3
EMILY,"Christopher, Lorelai, come back here!",3
CHRISTOPHERory,Why won't you call me ba ck?,3
LORELAI,"Hey, there couldn't be a worst time to have this conversation.",3
CHRISTOPHERory,"Really, because it seems to be the only time to have this conversation.",3
LORELAI,"Look, go home, okay? I promise I will talk to you tomorrow.",3
CHRISTOPHERory,"Well, sure, I believe that.",3
LORELAI,"Hey, I've never lied to you. There's no reason to doubt my word.",3
CHRISTOPHERory,Really? Forty-five unreturned phone calls isn't a reason?,3
LORELAI,"No, it isn't.",3
CHRISTOPHERory,You shutting me out like this is wrong.,3
LORELAI,I'm not discussing this with you here in my mother's house.,3
CHRISTOPHERory,"You don't get to dictate this. I need to talk to you, you won't call me back, and I did what I had to do. And I'm sorry   but after all we've been through, especially over these last few months   you shutting me out is wrong. And you know what hits me the hardest, Lor?",3
LORELAI,Apparently it isn't the door on your way out.,3
CHRISTOPHERory,You keeping Rory from me .,3
LORELAI,What?,3
CHRISTOPHERory,"I never, ever thought you'd do that.",3
LORELAI,I'm not keeping Rory from you.,3
CHRISTOPHERory,"Oh really? Then why hasn't she called me back, huh? I mean, no matter where you and I have been in our lives, my daughter has always called me back   until now.",3
LORELAI,"Hey, listen to me  ",3
RORY,I didn't call you back because I didn't want to. Me   Mom had nothing to do with it.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, honey, calm down.",3
RORY,"You promised me. You promised me at Sookie's wedding that this was going to work, that you were going to be there, you promised me.",3
CHRISTOPHERory,"Honey, please understand  ",3
RORY,"No, I always understand, and I don't wanna understand! I don't even really wanna talk about this right now. I've got Mom, that's all I need. Go be somebody else's dad!",3
CHRISTOPHERory,Don't say that.,3
RORY,I'm going upstairs. Call me w hen he's gone.,3
CHRISTOPHERory,She did not get there by herself.,3
LORELAI,"Hey, have you ever met your daughter? She could get anywhere by herself! She could get to the third dimension by herself! She was helping the crossing guard when she was four.",3
CHRISTOPHERory,I'm going to talk to her.,3
LORELAI,"No, you're not. She wants to be alone and cool off. Respect that. I'll talk to her later.",3
CHRISTOPHERory,"You'll talk to her, great. That makes me feel a whole lot better.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, you need to leave, right now.",3
CHRISTOPHERory,This isn't right. She needs her father.,3
LORELAI,"I know she needs her father, I've been telling her she needs her father! But she feels like her father bailed on her and she's mad and hurt, and I can't change that in three minutes!",3
CHRISTOPHERory,Do you think I like this situation?,3
LORELAI,Oh God.,3
CHRISTOPHERory,"Do you? I mean, after what you and I had going and now  ",3
LORELAI,"Chris, do you rememb er why we're here right now? What event in your life caused this very pleasant moment we're sharing?",3
CHRISTOPHERory,That has nothing to do with this.,3
LORELAI,"Oh   it   what? Chris, man! What do you want from me?",3
CHRISTOPHERory,I wanna talk!,3
LORELAI,About what?,3
CHRISTOPHERory,I don't know. I just. . . I don't like how things are.,3
LORELAI,But that's how they are!,3
CHRISTOPHERory,I didn't want things to turn out this way!,3
LORELAI,But they did turn out this way!,3
CHRISTOPHERory,But I didn't want that!,3
LORELAI,"Christopher, is Sherry still pregnant?",3
CHRISTOPHERory,Of course she is.,3
LORELAI,Are you still with her?,3
CHRISTOPHERory,Yes.,3
LORELAI,Are you gonna marry her?,3
CHRISTOPHERory,Yes.,3
LORELAI,"Then, honey, we are where we are! Accept it.",3
CHRISTOPHERory,I can't.,3
LORELAI,"Don't you understand that I can't talk to you because it hurts talking to you, really hurts! Standing here right now is k*lling me, okay? Don't you understand that?",3
EMILY,"Christopher, I think you'd better go now.",3
CHRISTOPHERory,"Emily, I . . .",3
EMILY,"Leave now, please.",3
LORELAI,"You know, you need a mask and a horse when you do that.",3
EMILY,,3
LORELAI,,3
LORELAI,"Well, now, that was a fun night.",3
RORY,Yup.,3
LORELAI,I haven't had that much fun since labor.,3
RORY,Ba-dum-bum.,3
LORELAI,"But seriously, ladies and gentlemen, is this on?",3
RORY,I can't believe he just came over.,3
LORELAI,He misses you.,3
RORY,He misses you.,3
LORELAI,"We're very missable. Honey, he loves you so much, he didn't mean to mess  ",3
RORY,"No, he never means to, but he does. And I don't care what he says or does, I'm not going to this wedding.",3
LORELAI,You don't have to.,3
RORY,Good.,3
LORELAI,"But you might, at a later point in your life, when you're not so angry and you make up with your dad, as we both know you will, you might be sorry you missed it.",3
RORY,It's the wrong wedding.,3
LORELAI,"Ah, things happen for a reason.",3
RORY,Since when is that your philosophy.,3
LORELAI,"Since now. By the way, I'm also a communist.",3
RORY,Really?,3
LORELAI,"Yes,  cause I look damn good in red.",3
RORY,I'm starving.,3
LORELAI,Really? Could it be  cause dinner sucked?,3
RORY,Could be.,3
LORELAI,Let's do mac and cheese.,3
RORY,And tater tots,3
LORELAI,And those little pizza rolls.,3
RORY,"Oh, and chili beef soup.",3
LORELAI,After which we will install our own vomitorium.,3
RORY,"Okay, nix the soup.",3
LORELAI,"And add some cake. Okay, let's be organized   make it fast, make it snappy, and if there's any impulse buying, make it chocolate.",3
RORY,"Aye aye, captain.",3
KIRK,Lorelai!,3
LORELAI,Oh no. Go on in.,3
RORY,Are you sure?,3
LORELAI,I have to take care of this.,3
RORY,Good luck.,3
LORELAI,Hey Kirk.,3
KIRK,"Lorelai, I know you haven't made up your mind yet, and I'm not here for an answer. I just need to know   are you allergic to tuna?",3
LORELAI,"Uh, no.",3
KIRK,"No, good. Thank you very much.",3
LORELAI,"Uh, Kirk, I have made up my mind.",3
KIRK,You have?,3
LORELAI,Yeah.,3
KIRK,Already?,3
LORELAI,Yes.,3
KIRK,And it's fully formed?,3
LORELAI,"Yes, it is.",3
KIRK,You don't need any other information?,3
LORELAI,"No, I don't.",3
KIRK, Cause I could have my mother call you if  ,3
LORELAI,Totally unnecessary.,3
KIRK,"Okay, well, then, go ahead.",3
LORELAI,"I just got out of a really weird relationship, and I know that sounds like a line, but it isn't. I'm just not. . .fully over the shock of it yet, and I never wanna hurt you because you're my friend and I like you, so I have to say no. I'm sorry.",3
KIRK,Was the tuna inquiry too personal?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, no, I thought it was very thoughtful",3
KIRK,You're sure you won't feel like it anytime soon?,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, I'm sure.",3
KIRK,,3

JESS,Good.,3
RORY,"It just surprised me, that's all.",3
JESS,Why?,3

JESS,Because why?,3
RORY,Because of what happened at Sookie's wedding.,3
JESS,Ah.,3
RORY,"Yeah, so me coming back here and just seeing you with Shane just kind of threw me for a sec.",3
JESS,"I'm sorry, did I hear from you at all this summer? Did I just happen to miss the thousands of phone calls you made to me, or did the postman happen to lose all those letters you wrote to me? You kiss me, you tell me not to say anything. . .very flattering, by the way. You go off to Washington. . . then nothing. Then you come back here all put out because I didn't just sit around and wait for you like Dean would've done? And yeah, what about Dean? Are you still with him? 'Cause last time I checked, you were, and I haven't heard anything to the contrary. Plus, the two of you walking around the other day like some damn Andy Hardy movie. Seemed to me like you're still pretty together. I half expected you to break into a barn and put on a show.",3
RORY,When did you see me w ith Dean?,3
JESS,At that stupid summer insanity plea the town put on.,3
RORY,"Oh, I'm surprised you could see anything with Shane's head plastered to your face.",3

RORY,This is sublime.,3
LORELAI,It was the golden age of television.,3
RORY,"The music, the costumes, the sets.",3
LORELAI,"All cylinders were fired on this one, boy!",3
RORY,And who knew that they all had such musical talent?,3
LORELAI,"And such far out booty shaking abilities, as well.",3
EDDIE,"Mail, ladies.",3

LORELAI,What's here?,3
RORY,My application to Harvard.,3
LORELAI,Oh my God. It's beautiful.,3
RORY,"Impressive letterage, huh?",3
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, it's so. . .",3
RORY,Very.,3
LORELAI,Can I hold it?,3
RORY,Be careful.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, it's heavy, heavy with importance.",3
RORY,I feel dizzy.,3
LORELAI,Are you sure that's not just the sight of Robert Reed in the tight clown pants?,3
RORY,"Oh, geez. Let the record show that when my application to Harvard arrived, we were watching ""The Brady Bunch Variety Hour.""",3
LORELAI,"You don't lose points for that, do you?",3
RORY,"I hope not. Man, this morning I was reading Dead Souls   it couldn't have come then?",3
LORELAI,"Well, we'll just tell people that's what you were doing, and that I was studying a really big globe. They'll never know.",3
RORY,You can keep a secret?,3
LORELAI,"Not so far, but there's always a first.",3
RORY,Dead Souls and a really big globe.,3

LORELAI,"They're going to expect a higher level of wit when you're at Harvard. Oh, watch that drink.",3
RORY,I'm nowhere near it.,3
LORELAI,"Well, keep it that way. This is an uncontaminated area. I even cleaned the table using something other than the sleeve of my sweater and spit.",3
RORY,Lovely image. I'll be careful.,3
LORELAI,"All right, here we go. First question. Uh! Oh my God.",3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,"""What were you doing the moment you received this application?"" counts for fifty percent of your eligibility.",3
RORY,Stop.,3
LANE,I need help.,3
LORELAI,With what?,3
RORY,She's writing her drummer -seeks-rock-band ad.,3
LANE,And it's not reading right to me. Could you guys look it over?,3
RORY,"Let's see   ""Drummer with strong beat seeks band into the Accelerators, the Adolescents, the Adverts, Agent Orange, the Angelic Upstarts, the Agnostic Front, Ash. . ."" You went alphabetically.",3

LORELAI,And a little OCD.,3
RORY,And a little long.,3
LANE,I can't make cuts.,3
RORY,"It's three pages, single spaced   make cuts.",3

LORELAI,Or Droopy Drawers.,3
RORY,That was never my nickname.,3
LORELAI,"Wrong, I called you that as a baby.",3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,"That's right. You had these little OshKosh cords and they were way too big and once at the mall, they fell right down to your knees and I said, ""Whoa, there, Droopy Drawers!""   and I'm just afraid if we don't answer everything accurately, the Harvard police will come and hit you with an atlas and say something mean in Latin.",3
RORY,How would they know that you called me Droopy Drawers?,3
LORELAI,"Well, we could be at a Harvard event and I could slip up and say, ""Pass me a lobster puff, Droopy Drawers,"" and they could hear me, and that'll be that.",3
RORY,How  bout you don't drink at any of these Harvard events?,3
LORELAI,"Okay, parental information. Mother   breathtaking.",3
RORY,I think they just want your name.,3
LORELAI,Father   ostracized. Personal statement.,3
RORY,"Oh, the essay   the big kahuna.",3
LORELAI,You can evaluate a significant experience that's had an impact on you. How  bout that time your drawers dropped at the mall?,3
RORY,Enough with the drawers.,3
LORELAI,Or you can write about a person who has had a significant influence on you.,3
RORY,You?,3
LORELAI,"Or one of your authors, Faulkner or. . .",3
RORY,Or Sylvia Plath.,3
LORELAI,"Hm, might send the wrong message.",3
RORY,The sticking her head in the oven thing?,3
LORELAI,"Yeah. Although she did make her kids a snack first, shows a certain maternal instinct.",3
LANE,"Okay, I just crunched the numbers and at two thousand words and twenty-five cents a word, this stupid ad's gonna cost five hundred dollars! That's five months worth of Minwaxing end tables at my mom's store. I give up.",3
RORY,"No, don't give up. Just cut down your influences to the most important ones, like with David Bowie.",3
LANE,Gotta have Bowie.,3
RORY,But do you have to list every album he ever recorded plus your personal rating between one to ten?,3
LANE,Maybe not.,3
LORELAI,And what's with Jackson Browne making the list?,3
LANE,"Ah, see, cool people know that he's more than a mellow hippie-dippy folkie, that he actually wrote some of Nico's best songs and was in fact her lover before he bored us with ""Doctor My Eyes."" That will separate the poseurs from the non-poseurs.",3
RORY,"Wax on, wax off.",3
LANE,I hate this.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, what activities interest you?",3
RORY,All of them except for the sports.,3
LORELAI,I thought you were the lacrosse kid.,3
RORY,"Mom, just a modicum of seriousness as we do this would be much appreciated.",3
LORELAI,"Hm, so, circle all of them except sports. Oh, they want a picture. How about the one of us sticking our heads through the carved out holes of Johnny Bravo and SpongeBob Squarepants?",3
RORY,There's the seriousness I crave.,3
LANE,I'm going to have to crank the Ramones if I have to make deep cuts.,3
RORY,We'll move outside.,3
LORELAI,,3
RORY,Thank you.,3
LUKE,Do they let kids drink coffee before school?,3
RORY,"Why, do you think it might lead to harder stuff? Lattes, cappucinos. . .",3
LUKE,Forget I asked.,3
RORY,"So, what are you doing Saturday?",3
DEAN,Just my usual chores.,3
RORY,"Your usual chores, John-boy?",3
DEAN,"Well, what else do you call house jobs?",3
RORY,I call them the stuff you avoid until the Environmental Protection Agency steps in.,3
DEAN,Why do you ask?,3
RORY,I thought we could see a movie or something.,3
DEAN,You're not free.,3
RORY,How do you know?,3
DEAN, Cause you'll be working on your application all weekend.,3
RORY,"No, I'm not.",3
DEAN,Really?,3
RORY,"It's not due for weeks, and I already have my essay topic picked out.",3
DEAN,Which is?,3
RORY,Hillary Clinton.,3
DEAN,Sounds perfect.,3
RORY,"I know. She's so smart and tough and nobody thought she could win New York but she did and she's doing amazing, and have you heard her speak?",3
DEAN,Only when you've played me the thousands of hours of C-SPAN footage you taped.,3
RORY,"She's a great speaker, strong and persuasive with a wonderful presence, and even those suits of hers are getting better.",3
DEAN,I'd include that in the essay.,3
RORY,"Anyhow, now that I have Hillary, all I need is a date for Saturday. Suggestions?",3
DEAN,You're on.,3
RORY,"Great. Oh, there's my bus. Sip. Kiss. And bye.",3
DEAN,Bye.,3
LUKE,Fast runner.,3
DEAN,It's the coffee.,3
LUKE,Not your face?,3
DEAN,Excuse me?,3
LUKE,,3
PARIS,"Everyone always says that! This is my speaking voice. This is its natural volume! Fine, fine!",3
PARIS,Short-sighted morons.,3
RORY,"What now, Paris?",3
PARIS,"We went to all this trouble to set up this stupid seminar. I say we, but let's face it, I did most of the work, and Mr. Hunter won't let me do it the way I want.",3
RORY,The panelists are up there. We sit across from them and ask questions. What's the problem?,3
PARIS,It's boring and predictable and done to death. I wanted Charlie Rose.,3
RORY,To ask the questions?,3
PARIS,His style. I wanted us sitting at a round table with black backdrops.,3
RORY,But the audience won't be able to see anything.,3
PARIS,"I was working with the losers in the AV club to project it on a giant video screen. And all Mr. Hunter said was, ""Paris, this isn't the Beatles at Shea Stadium."" Nice anachronism, huh? Like they had video screens in sixty-three. His references are as topical as his suits. MR.",3
HUNTERory,"Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention please? We can get this seminar started. I'd like to bring up the organizers of this little event, Paris Gellar and Rory Gilmore.",3
PARIS,"Thank you, Mr. Hunter. Everybody, this is a seminar called ""The Business of Getting In."" Its goal is to help guide us through the torturous process of applying to, and getting into, the right college. My panelists are Jim Romaine, admissions officer at Princeton University, and Ivy-League college consultant, Rose Samuels. Welcome, panel.",3
RORY,"Yes, welcome.",3
PARIS,"Now, panel, you're addressing a group of kids just beginning the stressful process of applying to college. Question   what is the biggest mistake a person can make on his or her application? Mr. Romaine? MR.",3
ROMAINE,"Well, forgetting to send it in would be the worst mistake, but perfunctory answers would be high on my list.",3
PARIS,Explain.MR.,3
ROMAINE,"I'm talking about run of the mill responses, a lack of originality, particularly in the essay category. If I read one more over-adulating piece of prose about Hillary Clinton and her profound influence, my head will explode. MS.",3
SAMUELS,I hear that. Sometimes a mistake like that comes from writing what one thinks an admission officer wants to read. MR.,3
ROMAINE,Big mistake. MS.,3
SAMUELS,And sometimes it's just a lack of original thought. MR.,3
ROMAINE,Just as big a mistake.,3
PARIS,"Personal anecdote   when I was twelve and I was writing the first of my trial essays in practice for the day I'd write my real essay, I chose Hillary Clinton. Then I realized every braindead bint in a skirt would be writing about Hillary, but it was good to clear the pipes. Now, what are some other mistakes? MR.",3
ROMAINE,"Well, small thing, but if your printing is bad, that says something we don't like. If your extracurriculars and volunteer activities are too by-the-book, that says something we don't like. MS.",3
SAMUELS,"Yes, those activities should have a personality behind them   a focus, a direction. I've seen applications where the student has circled every activity listed. Again, you're trying too hard there. One can't be interested in everything. MR.",3
ROMAINE,They're the ones who've had college paraphernalia on their walls their whole lives. MS.,3
SAMUELS,"Too hungry, it's a little immature.",3
PARIS,"Interesting, interesting. Rory, do you wanna ask a question?",3
RORY,No.,3
PARIS,What?,3
RORY,"No, thank you.",3
PARIS,"Okay. So, how early should a student get an application in? MR.",3
ROMAINE,,3
EMILY,"So, she's meet ing you here?",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, she had a thing after school, a rumble or something. She said she'd be over after.",3
EMILY,A rumble?,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, a bunch of kids meet in an alley, they pirouette, they pull knives, it's a whole to-do.",3
EMILY,So she's meet ing you here?,3
LORELAI,"Yes, she's meet ing us here. Where's Dad?",3
EMILY,The magazines.,3
LORELAI,That was weird. . .and unresponsive.,3
EMILY,These are college issues of various magazines. I've been collecting them for a couple of months now.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, well, Rory's probably seen all those, but thanks anyway.",3
EMILY,Have you read these?,3
LORELAI,No.,3
EMILY,"Well, you should. I've unearthed some shocking statistics. I mean, do you have any idea how hot the competition is to get into a school like Harvard?",3
LORELAI,"Well, yeah, it's very hot. It's one of the top schools in the country.",3
EMILY,"In the world. People from Ch ina, Russia, India, children from every country apply to Harvard. There's more competition than ever before.",3
LORELAI,"Really, Mom, I know all this.",3
EMILY,"With the dot-com bust and the job market dwindling and the stock market going up and down like a yo-yo, everyone and his brother knows the best chance for success and financial security is not just to go to college, but to go to a top college.",3
LORELAI,"Thank you, got it, appreciate the info.",3
EMILY,"Every child that applies has the same high grade point average, they've taken the same AP classes, and they're all on the student council.",3
LORELAI,They're not all that identical.,3
EMILY,One college admissions officer said that he sometimes puts a random stack of applications in the yes pile and the rest in the no pile because he knows it doesn't make any difference. He doesn't even so much as glance at them.,3
LORELAI,That does not sound real.,3
EMILY,"And now it's the in thing for young Hollywood celebrities to go to universities. What do they call themselves, the Brat Pack?",3
LORELAI,About a hundred years ago.,3
EMILY,"They get into wherever they want based on name recognition. I was watching TV and that insipid Kate Hudson was talking about going to a university. If she decides to go to Harvard, she'll get right in over Rory, who we know is more qualified.",3
LORELAI,"How  bout a drink, Mom? You want a drink,  cause I sure do.",3
EMILY,"Lorelai, hold on here. What are we gonna do about this?",3
LORELAI,"Look, there is no we, okay? It's me   me and Rory   that's the we. I appreciate your concern and your prodigious research, but it's all gonna be fine. Rory's special.",3
EMILY,"Well, you know that and I know that but those idiots at Harvard may not necessarily know that.",3
RORY,Hello?,3
LORELAI,"Uh, we're in here, honey, and hurry!",3
RORY,Hi Grandma.,3
EMILY,Hello Rory. You look flushed.,3
RORY,"I ran from the bus stop, I'm okay. Mom, hey, I've been trying to call you   can I talk to you for a second?",3
EMILY,Is something wrong?,3
RORY,"No, I just need to talk to Mom about something, that's all. We'll be quick.",3
LORELAI,,3
RORY,I'm not getting into Harvard.,3
LORELAI,What? Who says?,3
RORY,"Well, I'm completely unprepared, and I have no original thoughts!",3
LORELAI,"No, no, don't blame yourself, it's not you. It's those jerks at Harvard   I hate them!",3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,"Well, apparently, it doesn't matter how qualified you are, those lazy-ass admissions officers just take applications and stick it in the yes and no piles without even glancing at them!",3
RORY,"Well, it won't matter because my Hillary Clinton essay will be just like every other girl's Hillary Clinton essay because apparently that's all we can think of. I'm such a hack.",3
LORELAI,Is it true everyone has the same GPA? How is that possible?,3
RORY,"Because we all take the same classes and we all give the same perfunctory run-of-the-mill responses. And I'm interested in too many things, I have to limit them. I'm gonna circle travel on my application. From now on, that is what I am interested in, travel.",3
LORELAI,"No, no, don't do that, no! Because all those people coming from China and India and Godknows where else, they're all nuts for traveling   that's why they're traveling here! And and jobs are dropping and dot-com bombing and something's acting like a yo-yo, I don't know what but it's not good! And over my dead body is Kate Hudson getting your spot, let me just say that right now!",3
RORY,"Mom, you're freaking out!",3
LORELAI,"Yes, I'm freaking out!",3
RORY,"Well, you can't freak out, I'm freaking out! Hello?",3
PARIS,"What the hell did Romaine mean when he was going on about weeding out the hyper-intense in the interview process? He stopped just short of calling me by name, I'm losing it!",3
RORY,"Not now, Paris.",3
PARIS,I tried to throw the questioning over to you because I was about to heave and you left me hanging so I had to come home an d heave.,3
RORY,"I'll talk to you tomorrow, Paris.",3
PARIS,Wait!,3
LORELAI,"Okay, we gotta calm down here.",3
RORY,"So, set an example.",3
LORELAI,"Hey, I'm human, too.",3
RORY,My forehead is burning up.,3
LORELAI,"My heart is beating so fast, it's gotta slow down.",3
RORY,"Okay, just. . .let's take a breath.",3
LORELAI,Okay. This freaking out is not good.,3
RORY,It sucks.,3
LORELAI,"We can do this. If others can do this, we can do this!",3
RORY,"Well, I'm not so sure anymore.",3
LORELAI,That is unacceptable!,3
RORY,"Well, I don't wanna accept it.",3
LORELAI,Then we won't.,3
RORY,"Well, what do we do?",3
LORELAI,I don't know. We definitely need some sort of perspective.,3
RORY,I think we need therapy.,3
LORELAI,"And booze! For those of us over twenty-one. Okay, are we calming? Are we less-freaked?",3
RORY,I'm totally freaked out.,3
LORELAI,"Well, hide it!",3
RORY,I can't hide it.,3
LORELAI,"Then prepare yourself for an evening of magazine recitations by Emily ""DJ Doom-meister"" Gilmore.",3
RORY,,3
LORELAI,"Hello? . . . No, Lane should be here any minute. Is this about the ad? . . . Well, uh, give me your number and she'll call you back. . . Okay, then, what's the number of the dude whose couch you're sleeping on? . . .Uh! Dude doesn't have a phone? Well, try back later, dude. Thanks. Rory, are you up? If not, get up! And where's Lane? She's supposed to be fielding these. Hello? No, she's not, may I take a message? Oh, wait a minute   here she is, hold on.",3
LANE,Sorry. This is Lane.,3
LORELAI,Hey.,3
RORY,Hey.,3
LORELAI,"Aw, what's up?",3
RORY,I didn't sleep so well.,3
LORELAI,Poor thing.,3
RORY,I'm fine. I'm just a little bummed.,3
LANE,"No, wait, wait, wait, progressive rock is a really passé style now but I listed it as an influence because it was a progenitor of great things that came afterwards. I mean, I contend that you can draw a straight line from Yes to Jethro Tull to the Jam to Nirvana, bing bang boom. . . Who are the Jam? That's disturbing.",3
LORELAI,"Hey, maybe instead of going to college, you should drop out and I could quit my job and we can form an all-girl band with Lane, you know, like Bananarama. We could call it Tangerinarama or Banana-fana-fo-fana-rama. . .or something. Honey, I'm just kidding, you gotta go to college.",3
RORY,I'm up for anything at this point. I gotta go. I'll see you later?,3
LORELAI,"Feel better, okay?",3
RORY,I will.,3
LANE,,3
LUKE,"Hey Tom, what's up?",3
TOM,"Nothing much. Why don't you get me a ham on rye, mustard, no mayo.",3
LUKE,You got it.,3
BOY,Hi.,3
LUKE,You got money?,3
BOY,"Yes, sir.",3
LUKE,What can I get ya?,3
BOY,"Let's see. How about a nice, cold egg cream?",3
LUKE,A what cream?,3
BOY,An egg cream. A nice and cold one.,3
LUKE,What is that?,3
TOM,"It's like, uh, milk and soda water with flavoring, isn't it?",3
LUKE,You asking me?,3
BOY,Nice and cold.,3
LUKE,I heard that part.,3
TOM,Used to get them at Coney Island.,3
LUKE,"Go to Coney Island, kid.",3
BOY,"Sir, can I get something to go?",3
LUKE,You got money?,3
BOY,Uh huh.,3
LUKE,What do you want?,3
BOY,A black cow.,3
LUKE,"Aw, now, come on.",3
BOY,It's just root beer and ice cream.,3
LUKE,Root beer and ice cream?,3
BOY,Uh huh.,3
LUKE,"Well, I can do that.",3
BOY,As long as the ice cream's made the old fashioned way   on the premises.,3
LUKE,Now wait a second.,3
KIRK,"Hey, Luke, can you whip me up something in a hurry?",3
LUKE,"What, Kirk?",3
KIRK,A chocolate phosphate.,3
LUKE,"Okay, now, what the hell is this? Why do you want a phosphate?",3
KIRK,Because nothing says refreshment like a phosphate.,3
LUKE,"This is Taylor, right? Is he behind this?",3
KIRK,I'm not at liberty to say.,3
LUKE,"Okay, then, you tell me. And remember, if you lie, you'll go to hell.",3
BOY,He didn't say you'd get mad.,3
LUKE,,3
TAYLORory,What is this?,3
LUKE,That's my question. Now what the hell's going on here?,3
TAYLORory,I have no idea what you're talking about.,3
LUKE,"They're asking for phosphates and egg creams and black cows, and they already gave you up, so tell me w hat's going on.",3
TAYLORory,Who finked?,3
KIRK,"Him, him.",3
BOY,Snitch!,3
KIRK,"Well, you did.",3
LUKE,"It's not the kid's fault, Taylor. Now what is this about?",3
TAYLORory,"Well, you are so close-minded to new things, Luke, that I decided to make an admittedly desperate attempt to convince you of the need for something that I think is a terrific idea.",3
LUKE,Which is?,3
TAYLORory,"An old fashioned, turn of the century soda shop!",3
LUKE,Aye yi yi yi yi!,3
TAYLORory,It's just the kind of wholesome hang today's teens need to keep them off the streets.,3
LUKE,And our streets are so wild and out of control?,3
TAYLORory,"If you ask me, yes   and I have proof.",3
LUKE,What are these?,3
TAYLORory,"Surveillance photos of town goings-on, the dark side of Stars Hollow, Luke   not a pretty picture.",3
LUKE,These are kids on skateboards.,3
TAYLORory,"Slaloming around pop bottles right down the middle of the street. I'm telling you, Luke, if we don't quick furnish these skateboarding z-boys with a moral distraction, they're gonna turn Stars Hollow into Dogtown.",3
LUKE,This is the space next to the diner.,3
TAYLORory,I know.,3
LUKE,I own the space next to the diner.,3
TAYLORory,I know.,3
LUKE,You wanna open the soda shop in the space next to the diner?,3
TAYLORory,It's the only one that's appropriate.,3
LUKE,"Taylor, no, no, no, no, and every day from now on  til the end of my life, I am gonna come in here and say, ""Taylor, no!"" And when I die, I'm gonna have them freeze me next to Ted Williams, and when they find the cure to what I died of and they unfreeze me, my first words are gonna be, ""How's Ted?"" followed closely by, ""Taylor, no!""",3
TAYLORory,But the space is empty!,3
LUKE,Not for long.,3
TAYLORory,And what are your plans for it?,3
LUKE,A skateboard and pop bottle shop.,3
TAYLORory,That's not funny.,3
LUKE,With in-house experts to teach the craft of street slaloming.,3
TAYLORory,Still not funny.,3
LUKE,"Well, I'm not in a very funny mood!",3
KIRK,"Luke, are you taking applications for jobs at your skateboard and bottle shop?",3
LUKE,"Yeah, I'm interviewing people today, Kirk.",3
KIRK,Great. Shall I go home an d change or will casual suffice?,3
LUKE,I like the going home part.,3
KIRK,,3
RORY,Hey.,3
LORELAI,Hey. Guess who I actually had a very productive conversation with today? Headmaster Charleston.,3
RORY,You're kidding.,3
LORELAI,"No, and I think we came up with the solution to our application anxiety, you wanna hear it?",3
RORY,I guess.,3
LORELAI,"Well, we spent the first ten minutes on him bugging me to volunteer for more stuff at school, or in lieu of that to make a donation to build the new basketball court, and then another couple of minutes of me convincing him that what sounded like me going ""Ha!"" was really me clearing my throat, but after that we had a very pleasant, productive conversation.",3
RORY,And?,3
LORELAI,"He suggested setting up a meeting with a Harvard graduate, like a dinner or something. He even gave me the number of someone he knows.",3
RORY,An alumni dinner?,3
LORELAI,"Yes, exactly.",3
RORY,Do they do that?,3
LORELAI,"According to Charleston, it's done all the time.",3
RORY,Wow.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, it would be an opportunity to talk with someone who's been through it all and did it successfully. You can ask questions, he can give some perspective, it seems perfect.",3
RORY,It sounds a little weird.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, a little, but I'll go with you and what's the worst that can happen? We're bored and we blow a meal, but if this person can help, then that's a good thing, right?",3
RORY,I do have some questions. . . a lot of questions.,3
LORELAI,"Well, let's call him.",3
RORY,Now?,3
LORELAI,"Yes, yes, there's no time like the present, come on. His name is Darren Springsteen of Westport, Connecticut, Harvard class of 74. Uh! Ask if he has a brother named Bruce.",3
RORY,I'm not gonna ask him that. It's ringing.,3
LORELAI,Hee!,3
LORELAI,Why'd you hang up?,3
RORY,I'm not good at these things.,3
LORELAI,Did he answer?,3
RORY,Yes.,3
LORELAI,"Yes? Rory, that's a really terrible first impression. Uh oh.",3
RORY,Him?,3
LORELAI,Maybe.,3
RORY,He star sixty-nined us?,3
LORELAI,"Well, the Harvard people can afford all the latest technology. Answer!",3
LORELAI,"Hey, you've reached Suffragette City, and if you're calling about Lane Kim's ad, sorry we're not in, but don't commit rock and roll su1c1de   just crank a message with some feedback.",3
RORY,Oh geez.,3
LORELAI,"Well, if he is related to Bruce, he can dig it.",3
DAVE,"Hey, my name's Dave Rygalski, I'm calling about the ad. I left my number before, so call when you get a chance.",3
GIRLorelai,Where's my  ,3
DAVE,"Relax, I'm coming.",3
LORELAI,Let's try this again.,3
RORY,Can we please just do this later?,3
LORELAI,"No, let's get it done now. It's ringing.",3
RORY,Let's do it later.,3
LORELAI,It's ringing.,3
RORY,I'm gonna say the wrong thing or have the wrong tone in my voice. I'm not in good first impression mode right now. Unh!,3
LORELAI,"Hello? Hello, um, this is Rory Gilmore. I believe you were expecting my call. . .Um, oh, well, this is such a wonderful opportunity for me. . .Whatever's good for you will be great for me. . .",3
RORY,Not so breathy.,3
LORELAI,"That's how chickens talk! Lunch? Oh yes, let me just check my organizer. . .oh, perfect. My mother will be there, too. She's terrific. . . All right, I'll see you this weekend. . . Mm, bye.",3
RORY,You're no Danny Gans.,3
LORELAI,I never claimed to be.,3
RORY,He's gonna be expecting Chilton High School senior Trixie McBimbo.,3
LORELAI,"And her mother, Bambi McBimbo.",3
RORY,"But I guess it can't hurt, right?",3
LORELAI,It can only help.,3
RORY,Okay.,3
LORELAI,"And look, if it's a total bust, we'll grab a pole and Trixie and Bambi'll take it on the road. That's something to put on your application, huh? It'll set you apart.",3
RORY,Thanks Mom.,3
LORELAI,,3
LORELAI,"So, alumna is a girl graduate.",3
RORY,Right.,3
LORELAI,And alumnus is a man.,3
RORY,Singular.,3
LORELAI,So an unmarried man?,3
RORY,"No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural.",3
LORELAI,And plural is alumni.,3
RORY,"Right, and that can be girls and guys.",3
LORELAI,Kinky!,3
RORY,"No, not kinky, just what it is.",3
LORELAI,"Ugh, you're no fun when you're nervous.",3
RORY,"Oh yes, because you and I usually have so much fun with Latin.",3
LORELAI,"So what do we call this guy, alumnus Darren, you know, like you'd say farmer John or the butcher Lazar Wolf?",3
RORY,Hish-kabibble.,3
DARREN,Hello there.,3
LORELAI,"Hello, I'm Lorelai Gilmore.",3
DARREN,"Darren Springsteen, nice to meet you. And this must be the reason we're all here.",3
RORY,"Yes, hello. I'm hope we're not putting you out.",3
DARREN,"Putting us out? Today you are the Springsteen family's raison d'être. Come in, come in. Was your drive long?",3
LORELAI,Not too.,3
DARREN,"Stars Hollow is charming. The last time we drove through there, there was a pumpkin patch.",3
LORELAI,Sounds like us.,3
DARREN,In March.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, that would be the year the pumpkins arrived late.",3
DARREN,Sounds like a Dr. Seuss book. You came bearing gifts?,3
RORY,"What? Oh, this. No, this is not a gift. These are my records   grades, SATs.",3
LORELAI,It's Rory in a bag   you add water and her brilliance springs out.,3
DARREN,"Why don't I just glance at this some other time, mm? This afternoon, why don't we just talk and get to know one another, okay?",3
RORY,Sounds good.,3
LORELAI,You're a very nice alumni.,3
DARREN,Thanks.,3
RORY,That's the plural.,3
LORELAI,"Ah, rats!",3
DARREN,"Lorelai, Rory, say hello to Marie, my wife.",3
MARIE,"Hello, so good to have you here.",3
LORELAI,Hi.,3
RORY,Thank you.,3
MARIE,"How about drinks? Iced tea, water?",3
RORY,Iced tea's good.,3
LORELAI,Same here.,3
MARIE,Okay.,3
DARREN,"Do you like art, Rory?",3
RORY,Very much.,3
DARREN,"Modern painting is my passion. I've got a Hockney, a Kline   what I don't have is a Diebenkorn so please don't ask, ""Where's the Diebenkorn?""",3
LORELAI,"Uh, you warned me just in time.",3
DARREN,"I only recently got into sculpture. My latest acquisition, it's a Zoltan Kemeny. Very provocative. Don't you just love its audacity?",3
LORELAI,"Yes, it's very audacious.",3
DARREN,"So, what are some of your other interests, Rory?",3
LORELAI,"Oh, well, pull up a comfy chair there, Darren, because they are widespread and extensive.",3
RORY,I read a lot. I'm into the Russians lately.,3
DARREN,"Tolstoy, Turgenev?",3
RORY,Gogol is my thing right now   Dead Souls.,3
DARREN,One of my favorites.,3
LORELAI,"You were reading that when we got your Harvard application in the mail, weren't you sweetie?",3
RORY,"Yes, yes I was.",3
LORELAI,"I saw that Harvard logo on the envelope and I said, ""Rory, get your nose out of your Gogol and get over here!"" Of course, we have a TV somewhere, but it's really more of a funny little table to put a cup of chai tea on, you know what I mean?",3
DARREN,"I'm afraid I don't. I watch way too many sports, and I go to all the Harvard games. How about you   do you like sports?",3
LORELAI,Yes.,3
RORY,No.,3
LORELAI,"That is, we follow certain things.",3
RORY,We enjoy various aspects of certain sporting endeavors.,3
LORELAI,But it wouldn't be the kind that you could ask any follow-up questions on.,3
RORY,It's a general interest.,3
DARREN,"Got it. It's pretty much a waste of time, but it's how I waste my time. I collect memo rabilia, too. I've got each year's Harvard team pennant going back to 1927.",3
LORELAI,"Lots of displayed Harvard paraphernalia, huh?",3
DARREN,It's all over the walls at the rec room.,3
LORELAI,"See, see, lots of paraphernalia.",3
RORY,Watch the ribs there.,3
DARREN,"Ah, here are the kids. Jack, Jennifer, this is Lorelai and Rory.",3
JACK,Hi there.,3
JENNIFERory,It's nice to meet you.,3
LORELAI,Likewise.,3
RORY,Hi.,3
DARREN,Jack's premed at Princeton and Jennifer is bound for Harvard like you Rory.,3
JENNIFERory,"Oh, we should talk.",3
RORY,Sure.,3
JENNIFERory,"If not today, another day, okay?",3
RORY,Okay.,3
JENNIFERory,"Uh, do you wanna pick a time now or later. . .",3
RORY,Later's fine.,3
JENNIFERory,I'll make a note in my palm pilot.,3
RORY,Cool.,3
MARIE,Here are your teas.,3
RORY,Thank you.,3
MARIE,"Ah, Darren, we should really get the chicken going.",3
DARREN,"Right, right. You're getting my famous chicken today   I hope you like chicken.",3
RORY,Love it.,3
DARREN,"I'll be right back. Here's some of my Harvard yearbooks, peruse them if you like.",3
LORELAI,Oh.,3
JACK,"Yeah, and we should go clean up, Jen.",3
JENNIFERory,"Mm, definitely. I will see you in a jiff.",3
LORELAI,Ew!,3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,Did they just leave to take a shower together?,3
RORY,"Oh, gross!",3
LORELAI,"What? They bounced in together, they bounced out together.",3
RORY,New topic.,3
LORELAI,Can't take gritty reality?,3
RORY,Or slanderous postulating.,3
LORELAI,And how is it they just came of f the tennis court and they're not even sweating?,3
RORY,"I don't know. Maybe when you're that white, you don't sweat.",3
LORELAI,"Darren's nice though, isn't he?",3
RORY,"He's very nice. Hey, do you think I'm making a good impression?",3
LORELAI,"Great impression. He loves you, especially when he found out you share his love of various aspects of certain sporting endeavors.",3
RORY,"Hey, you started it. We could have just told the truth and said we weren't into sports.",3
LORELAI,I was trying to humanize us.,3
RORY,"Yeah, with our funny looking chai tea table. Very humanizing.",3
LORELAI,Zoltan Kemeny.,3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,"That artist's name   it sounds like robot language, doesn't it? Zoltan Kemeny.",3
RORY,Don't say it again.,3
LORELAI,"Zoltan Kemeny, Zoltan Kemeny.",3
RORY,"Stop, don't!",3
LORELAI,Zoltaaaan  ,3
MARIE,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm interrupting the fun.",3
LORELAI,"No, that's all right, you're not. We were just laughing at all the funny haircuts, that's all.",3
MARIE,"I know, aren't they a blast?",3
LORELAI,It's just a sea of goofy sideburns.,3
MARIE,Lunch will be ready in just a few minutes.,3
LORELAI,Zoltan.,3
RORY,,3
LORELAI,"Aw, wow, what a beautiful table.",3
RORY,"Yes, you didn't have to do that.",3
DARREN,"Oh, Rory, honestly, it's our pleasure.",3
DARREN,"Perfect timing, kids.",3
JACK,Excellent.,3
JENNIFERory,"Nice looking lunch, Mom.",3
LORELAI,Color coordinated.,3
RORY,Shh!,3
DARREN,"Guests of honor, why don't you sit over there.",3
RORY,Thank you.,3
LORELAI,"Aw, family pictures. You have another girl, don't you?",3
MARIE,"Yes, we do.",3
LORELAI,"Well, where is she? What does she do?",3
DARREN,"Oh, um. . .",3
MARIE,She's not here.,3
LORELAI,"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked.",3
DARREN,"Oh, no no, it's all right. That's Carol. She's a year ahead of Rory. She's. . .",3
MARIE,She's following her own path.,3
DARREN,Right. Carol's doing her own thing.,3
LORELAI,Okay.,3
DARREN,"Well, let's eat everybody. Honored guests, please choose from the chicken first.",3
RORY,Thank you very much.,3
DARREN,"You two are gonna have to fight over the breast as you always do. So, Lorelai, what's your alma matter?",3
LORELAI,"Well, I was too preoccupied to go to college, what with weighing a couple hundred pounds and having feet twice my normal size and all.",3
DARREN,I see.,3
RORY,But she took night classes and graduated last year. She has an AA degree in business.,3
MARIE,"Well, that's wonderful.",3
DARREN,"In fact, it's refreshing. It might even be to Rory's benefit. Good things didn't come to your family in one fell swoop, you struggled for it.",3
LORELAI,That's true.,3
DARREN,"One fell swoop, interesting phrase.",3
JACK,Very.,3
DARREN,Origin?,3
JACK,It was coined in MacBeth and derives from Middle English.,3
DARREN,"Very good, son. You know your Shakespeare then, do you?",3
JACK,More than most.,3
DARREN,In which play does Falstaff appear?,3
JACK,That would be plays.,3
DARREN,Mm.,3
JACK,"Henry the Fourth, part one and two, and The Merry Wives of Windsor.",3
DARREN,So that was a different Falstaff than Henry the Fifth?,3
JACK,"Aw, sh**t!",3
DARREN,"This is a little tradition with us, quizzes at meals. It keeps the Springsteens sharp.",3
LORELAI,Very Kennedy-esque.,3
JENNIFERory,"Mm, we love the Kennedys!",3
LORELAI,As do we all.,3
DARREN,"Now, the person questioned can challenge me with a follow-up if he gets his question right. Gets pretty competitive.",3
LORELAI,"Well, if pistols are drawn, we're ducking.",3
DARREN,"Jack, which Polish composer  ",3
JACK,Chopin!,3
DARREN,Patience. . .became Prime M inister of his country?,3
JACK,Paderewski.,3
DARREN,"That's right, but your impetuousness cost you a follow-up. Jennifer, can you give me the three sub-classes of the Mesozoic Era?",3
JENNIFERory,"Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous.",3
DARREN,Good.,3
JENNIFERory,Follow-up   what preceded the Mesozoic Era?,3
DARREN,Paleozoic.,3
LORELAI,He's good.,3
MARIE,It's hard to stump Darren.,3
JENNIFERory,"Impossible, he's brilliant.",3
DARREN,"Open question   which mythological figure has the head of a man, the body of a lion, and the tail of a scorpion? Here's a hint   it's also the title of a novel by Robertson Davies.",3
RORY,"Oh, Manticore.",3
DARREN,"Very good, Rory.",3
JACK,"Yes, very good, Rory.",3
JENNIFERory,"Yes, very good, Rory.",3
MARIE,"More water, Lorelai?",3
LORELAI,"Please, thank you.",3
DARREN,Do you know which French city famous for its water was the capital of collaborationist France?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, me? Um, Evian, Perrier, uh, Le Crystal Geyser?",3
DARREN,"Jennifer, you wanna help Lorelai out?",3
JENNIFERory,Vichy.,3
DARREN,That's correct.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, that's right. Vichy water, I knew that.",3
DARREN,What about the year of Germany's victory in the Franco-Prussian w*r?,3
LORELAI,"Huh, me ag ain?",3
DARREN,If you wish.,3
LORELAI,"I don't know that one. I do know Instanbul is Constantinople, so if you've got a date in Constantinople, she'll be waiting in Instanbul.",3
DARREN,That's true.,3
RORY,"You know, um, sorry to interrupt, but I'd like to wash my hands.",3
DARREN,"Our fault, we rushed you in here.",3
MARIE,"Our downstairs is being remodeled, you have to use upstairs. End of the hall.",3
RORY,Thank you.,3
LORELAI,Hurry back.,3
RORY,I will.,3
LORELAI,"So, that painting there, wow. The colors are so great, I can't stop staring at it. It's just beautiful.",3
DARREN,It is. It's by a student of Matisse. I think he caught the master's colors wonderfully.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, Matisse, love him.",3
DARREN,I think only a charlatan wouldn't. Anyone know the artistic movement Matisse championed and referred to as the Wild Beast?,3
JENNIFERory,"Oh, fauvism!",3
DARREN,Correct.,3
JENNIFERory,Follow up?,3
DARREN,,3
CAROLorelai,Coming through!,3
RORY,"Oh, sorry. I just heard music and . . . Cool room.",3
CAROLorelai,Tom Waits.,3
RORY,What?,3
CAROLorelai,The music.,3
RORY,"Oh, I thought so. I love him.",3
CAROLorelai,I worship him. I even mildly stalked him once.,3
RORY,Really?,3
CAROLorelai,"Last year, I heard he was staying at this hotel so I went there everyday and sat in the lobby drinking massive amounts of coffee waiting for him to walk by.",3
RORY,Did you see him?,3
CAROLorelai,"Nope, never came down. For all I know, he's still there. Hand me that brush?",3
RORY,"Oh, here.",3
CAROLorelai,Stupid manager made me cover for Fiona today. That girl's a major pie crust. Ears?,3
RORY,What?,3
CAROLorelai,On the chair. What time is it?,3
RORY,"Um, three.",3
CAROLorelai,"Oh, totally late for my next job. Oh well, guess Grandma had to take another trip to the emergency room, right? Are they on straight?",3
RORY,I think so.,3
CAROLorelai,Good. Who are you?,3
RORY,"I'm sorry, I'm Rory Gilmore.",3
CAROLorelai,You're one of the Harvard bound?,3
RORY,"Yeah. At least, I hope so.",3
CAROLorelai,"Oh, trust me, you are. You've got that really good, straight, shiny Harvard hair. Zip me up?",3
RORY,"I'm sorry, are you Carol?",3
CAROLorelai,"Yeah, why?",3
RORY,"I don't know, I just didn't expect. . .",3
CAROLorelai,What?,3
RORY,"Well, you.",3
CAROLorelai,Why?,3
RORY,I don't know. Your parents just made it sound like. . .,3
CAROLorelai,Like I was holed up in the Chelsea with a needle sticking out of my arm screaming Sid at the top of my lungs?,3
RORY,Kind of.,3
CAROLorelai,"Well, to them, this is pretty close.",3
RORY,Can I ask you what exactly you are dressing up like this for?,3
CAROLorelai,Morgan Tanner's fourth birthday party.,3
RORY,You're kidding.,3
CAROLorelai,"Nope, this is my fifth birthday party this week. Great tips, all cash, and of course, there's cake.",3
RORY,So you're a waitress and a birthday bunny and you go to school. That's pretty amazing.,3
CAROLorelai,I don't go to school.,3
RORY,"Oh, sorry, I just assumed. I mean, your family . . .",3
CAROLorelai,"My brother and sister got stuck on that conveyor belt. I, however, escaped somewhere around the eleventh grade, thank God.",3
RORY,Huh.,3
CAROLorelai,"Oh, hey, but no offense. I mean, that's just me. If you like being on the conveyor belt, then good for you.",3
RORY,I'm not on the conveyor belt.,3
CAROLorelai,Okay.,3
RORY,I'm not. I want this. I've dreamt of going to Harvard since I was a little girl.,3
CAROLorelai,"Yeah, a lot of four year olds dream of that. It comes right after meeting Harry Potter.",3
RORY,"Hey, I am not gonna justify myself to someone with a tail.",3
CAROLorelai,"You're right, I'm sorry. It's just that around here the Harvard brainwashing starts in the womb. If you were to tell either of my siblings that there was another life choice outside of the Ivy League, I think their khakis would wrinkle.",3
RORY,"Well, maybe they really want it.",3
CAROLorelai,"Nope, my parents want it and they wanna please my parents. Have you seen a carrot?",3
RORY,Don't you wanna please your parents?,3
CAROLorelai,"Yeah, but not at the expense of finding myself.",3
RORY,Or your carrot.,3
CAROLorelai,"You gotta have your carrot. So, tell me something, Harvard hair   how bad do you wanna please your parents?",3
RORY,"My mom, and really bad, but it's not hard to please my mom. She's okay with anything I do. As long as I'm happy, she's good.",3
CAROLorelai,You're sure?,3
RORY,I'm very sure.,3
CAROLorelai,Then you're lucky.,3
RORY,"Yeah, I am lucky.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, Rory, quick, uh, what are the three major Hindu deities, because I've missed four questions in a row and if I miss another one, I don't think I get dessert.",3
RORY,"Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu.",3
LORELAI,"Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu. Hi other daughter.",3
CAROLorelai,Hi.,3
LORELAI,And I probably shouldn't do a gesundheit joke when I say Vishnu?,3
RORY,Good thinking.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, thanks, bye.",3
RORY,"Wait, I'll go with you. I'm glad to have met you.",3
CAROLorelai,"Oh, same here. Good luck with Harvard.",3
RORY,Thanks.,3
LORELAI,Oh. . . oh. What's that for?,3
RORY,For not putting me on the conveyor belt.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, that was very big of me.",3
RORY,,3
RORY,"Thank you so much for this, for answering all my dumb questions.",3
DARREN,"You asked no dumb questions, and I hope my answers sufficed.",3
RORY,Definitely. Bye.,3
DARREN,Au revoir.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, thank you so much for everything. I know it did a world of good for her.",3
DARREN,She's a very impressive young lady.,3
LORELAI,I wholeheartedly concur.,3
DARREN,You molded her well.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, no, I didn't mold her. Rory popped out that way.",3
DARREN,You're being modest.,3
LORELAI,"You don't know me, do you?",3
DARREN,So long.,3
LORELAI,Bye.,3
RORY,What did he say?,3
LORELAI,That you're Godlike.,3
RORY,Is that all?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, and that his brother Bruce Springsteen would be happy to come and play at our next party or event.",3
RORY,That would be swell of Bruce.,3
LORELAI,I figured your graduation party.,3
RORY,,3
TAYLORory,"All in favor, say aye.",3
EVERYONE,Aye.,3
TAYLORory,"All right, let the record show that the funds have been approved to close the town bank account that holds the town funds in order to open a new town funds bank account at a different banking institution.",3
TAYLORory,"Young ladies, in anticipation of your tardiness, we saved two seats for you right there in the back.",3
LORELAI,"Thanks for thinking of us, Taylor. Whew! Okay, raise your hand if you bathed in cologne.",3
TAYLORory,"In the interest of getting home sometime tonight, I'd like to bring up the final point of business, and that is a certain citizen's desire to open an old fashioned soda shop in town.",3
LUKE,Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.,3
BABETTE,Who's the guy?,3
LUKE,What other putz would wanna open up an old-fashioned soda shop?,3
TAYLORory,"Dispense with the Yiddish, young man.",3
LUKE,"This is not a town matter, Taylor. This is a private matter between you and me which was settled when I said no.",3
TAYLORory,"This is a town matter because when this town is in need of a particular business to provide necessary services, it's up to the town to band together and lure it.",3
LUKE,How does a stupid soda shop count as a necessary business?,3
TAYLORory,"Allow me to show you something that will make you wonder how we ever lived without it. Kirk, if you will.",3
TAYLORory,"Kirk, I told you to get something decorative to cover it.",3
KIRK,"Well, my mom wouldn't let me use one of her nice tablecloths so I just grabbed a sheet from my hamper.",3
TAYLORory,Take it off.,3
LUKE,,3
PATTY,"Oh, it's awfully cute.",3
TAYLORory,That is a professionally manufactured diorama of the proposed business.,3
RORY,"Wow, there's little people and everything.",3
SOOKIE,They look so real.,3
JACKSON,"Hey, it's me holding a tiny zucchini!",3
LORELAI,Look at the horse drawn carriage.,3
TAYLORory,My thought was to park it out front with the name of the business painted on the side. It's very eighteen-hundreds.,3
BABETTE,The horse is taller than the front door.,3
LORELAI,Way taller.,3
LUKE,"What are you up to, Taylor? Are you breeding giant horses?",3
TAYLORory,It's slightly out of proportion.,3
BABETTE,Slightly? That little guy there could walk right under the horse without even ducking.,3
TAYLORory,"You're missing the big picture here, townsfolk. Now, this wonderful business belongs in Stars Hollow   whether Luke rents the space willingly or not.",3
LUKE,How would I not rent it willingly?,3
TAYLORory,"I'm talking about eminent domain, my friend. Check the town's bylaws. If a three-fourths majority finds it necessary to use the space for a specific function, the landowner must concede.",3
LUKE,"That's for taking over houses to turn into hospitals during a national emergency like the Civil w*r. If you wanna turn this place into a Civil w*r hospital, be my guest!",3
TAYLORory,Some w ould attest that the succor that my soda shop is going to offer is on the same level as the comfort that a hospital could provide.,3
LUKE,"You're gonna need a hospital, Taylor!",3
LORELAI,Hit him!,3
RORY,Which one?,3
LORELAI,"Either one, I'm eas y.",3
TAYLORory,"Come on, Luke. This shop is based on the original soda shop that was in town eighty years ago. Don't you see? You are preventing the town  ",3
LUKE,From mo ving backwards. Who here wants to do that?,3
LORELAI,We like ice cream.,3
LUKE,"Oh, come on.",3
RORY,"A nice burger from Luke's and an ice cream soda, yum!",3
LUKE,You want that thing?,3
LORELAI,With a cherry.,3
LUKE,With the striped awning and the giant horse?,3
LUKE,Be ready to pay through the nose.,3
TAYLORory,We'll talk terms. We have our soda shop everybody! Meeting dismissed.,3
KIRK,"Taylor, is it too soon to talk about management opportunities?",3
LORELAI,"Hey, you get to be Taylor's landlord, that's kind of cool.",3
LUKE,Thanks for your lack of help.,3
LORELAI,,3
LANE,"So, how was lunch with Harvard guy?",3
RORY,"Great, he answered all my questions.",3
LORELAI,"He makes a k*ller chicken, he sticks a lemon up its butt.",3
LANE,Nice.,3
RORY,And he gave me exc ellent tips on how to write my essay. We're very impressed with him.,3
LORELAI,He passes the test.,3
DAVE,"Excuse me, Lane?",3
LANE,That's me.,3
DAVE,"Okay, great, I'm Dave Rygalski.",3
LANE,"Right, hi. You're a guitarist.",3
DAVE,Yeah.,3
LANE,But how'd you know I was me?,3
DAVE,The Dead Kennedys shirt was a tip off.,3
LANE,"Good thinking. Hey, uh, isn't it a drag that Jello Biafra isn't singing for them anymore?",3
DAVE,"Yeah, now their front-man's that kid from the Courtship of Eddie's Father.",3
LANE,"Yeah, what's next   Urkel joining the Wu-Tang Clan?",3
DAVE,Or maybe Malcolm in the Middle fronting for the Butthole Surfers.,3
LANE,Some things are sacred.,3
DAVE,I'm with ya on that.,3
LANE,"So, um, what's your band like?",3
DAVE,"We do a lot of cool covers   uh, the Clash, the Kinks, et cetera. Statistically, it's like thirty- eight of the forty-three bands you listed.",3
LANE,Nice percentage.,3
DAVE,I can play you a song we demo'd a couple weeks ago using a drum machine.,3
LANE,Great. What's all this?,3
DAVE,"Well, this is a headphone amp and it just boosts the volume and makes the clarity off the hook, and then these are Grado 125s, which is just really, k*ller, k*ller portable sound. I'm sort of an audio geek, sorry.",3
LANE,"No, don't apologize, I love you. . .for that, for being that way. I love it. Um, I'm like that too.",3
DAVE,You wanna go over to the bench maybe and have a listen?,3
LANE,Yeah.,3
DAVE,Okay.,3
RORY,I think a love song's in their future.,3
LORELAI,With lots of lyrics about snogging.,3
RORY,About what?,3
DEAN,Hey.,3
RORY,Hey. You missed everything.,3
LORELAI,That's snogging.,3
RORY,Got it.,3
LORELAI,Bye.,3
DEAN,"So, any fireworks?",3
RORY,"Well, there was a classic Luke/Taylor dispute, but it was resolved and will result in ice cream floats and twenty foot horses.",3
DEAN,Good deal. And what about your lunch?,3
RORY,"Oh, it was great. I feel so much better about things now. The application's not freaking me out anymore.",3
DEAN,You look unfreaked.,3
RORY,"Well, nothing can stop me now. It's full steam ahead.",3
DEAN,That's great. Can I ask you something?,3
RORY,Of course you can.,3
DEAN,What happens when you leave?,3
RORY,When I leave when?,3
DEAN,When you leave for Harvard. . .do we break up?,3
RORY,"Whoa, that was blunt and out of nowhere.",3
DEAN,"Well, it seems like we should be blunt right now.",3
RORY,"No, we don't break up. Do you want that?",3
DEAN,"No, but how will we see each other?",3
RORY,"Easy, weekends   that's what they were invented for.",3
DEAN,"So you'll come home, do homework all weekend, then leave.",3
RORY,"No, I can do my homework during the week or on the train coming home to see you, who I will spend my weekends with not doing homework. Plus, we can talk during the week on the phone constantly. Trust me, it'll feel like I never left.",3
DEAN,Oh yeah?,3
RORY,"Christiane Amanpour spends half of her life standing in foxholes in third world countries, and she has a husband and a kid. And she was on C-SPAN last week getting some award, so if she and her husband can make it work, we can.",3
DEAN,So we'll have access to the CNN jet?,3
RORY,"No. Or hey, you can go to college in Boston.",3
DEAN,I'm going to junior college.,3
RORY,Boston has junior colleges.,3
DEAN,But not dorm rooms.,3
RORY,"Well, you can rent an apartment.",3
DEAN,"With the money I get when I win the lottery? I mean, I think access to the CNN jet is more likely.",3
RORY,Why are you being like this? So. . .,3
DEAN,Realistic?,3
RORY,"Come on, be serious.",3
DEAN,I am. I am.,3
RORY,That's too serious.,3
DEAN,"Yeah, uh, you know, just forget it. Come on, we were gonna go to Luke's, right?",3
RORY,Yeah.,3
DEAN,Let's go to Luke's.,3
LANE,"It's great, it really is.",3
DAVE,"Okay, cool. Well, listen, then I'll talk to the guys, uh, and we'll get together and play next week.",3
LANE,"Sure. Um, I've gotta get home.",3
DAVE,"All right. Well, uh, it was good meeting you, Lane.",3
LANE,Same here.,3
DAVE,Trust God   is that a band?,3
LANE,No. My life.,3
SOOKIE,"Oh, come on, you do not like modern art.",3
JACKSON,"Oh, then I was mistaken, I guess I don't. I'm a mindless android, I have no opinions.",3
SOOKIE,"Well, what kind do you like?",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, do you like the kind that looks like someone hemorrhaged on a canvas?",3
JACKSON,"Yes, I love hemorrhaging.",3
SOOKIE,Or the sculpture that looks like it was dropped and then glued back together?,3
JACKSON,"Actually, the real love of my life is being mercilessly teased by the two of you for simply stating an opinion.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, we're sorry.",3
SOOKIE,"Yeah, we're sorry. Kisses!",3
JACKSON,"Oh, in public, no less.",3
LORELAI,"Hey, where's Rory? We need all the girls a-kissing ya.",3
JACKSON,"Hey, that reminds me, what are you gonna do with Rory's room?",3
LORELAI,"Her room, when?",3
JACKSON,When she's gone. Are you doing anything with it?,3
LORELAI,"Well, I haven't thought about it.",3
JACKSON,"Well, let me know. We can work something out.",3
LORELAI,You want her room?,3
SOOKIE,"For what, your burgeoning modern art collection?",3
JACKSON,I'm talking about my tools.,3
SOOKIE,"Oh, your tools, yeah.",3
LORELAI,What tools?,3
JACKSON,I have this collection of antique farming tools that my dad passed down to me.,3
SOOKIE,Pre-Revolutionary w*r. They're kind of valuable.,3
JACKSON,And I've got no place to put them. I've been looking for the right space.,3
LORELAI,In Rory's room?,3
SOOKIE,It's perfect!,3
LORELAI,But she's got all her stuff in it.,3
JACKSON,Not for long.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, right, not for long.",3
JACKSON,Just think about it.,3
LORELAI,,3
LORELAI,"No, no, not another band phone call!",3
RORY,We never gave Lane a cutoff time.,3
LORELAI,Let the machine get it. I cannot talk to another seventeen-year-old whose every other word is  uh'.,3
RORY,Not even a word.,3
LORELAI,Exactly.,3
DARREN,"Hello, Gilmores! This is Darren Springsteen, how are ya? I just wanted to let you know that I just finished going over Rory's records here, and no shock, they're perfect. Rory, you are tailor-made for Harvard. They're lucky to have you. As far as I'm concerned, you should pack your bags. I'm gonna tell all this to the people in admissions and I'll give your headmaster a call as well, so take care and we'll talk again. Bye-bye.",3
LORELAI,"That's fantastic, honey.",3
RORY,Yeah.,3
LORELAI,You're in.,3
RORY,"Well, not officially.",3
LORELAI,He said pack your bags.,3
RORY,"Yeah, cool.",3
LORELAI,"So what are you up to today? You have, uh, newspaper stuff to do, right?",3
RORY,"Yeah, a ton, and you were going to catch up with some stuff at the inn?",3
LORELAI,Payroll. . . a lot of check signing to do.,3
RORY,Are people waiting for their checks?,3
LORELAI,Kind of.,3
RORY,"Right. You know, um, the newspaper stuff can wait  til Monday.",3
LORELAI,Really?  Cause I can sign the checks tomorrow.,3
RORY,You sure?,3
LORELAI,Absolutely.,3
RORY,So what do you wanna do?,3
LORELAI,"I don't know, what do you wanna do?",3
RORY,"I don't know, let's just hang.",3
LORELAI,,3
LUKE,You had to have ordered that sign weeks ago! You were that sure that I would cave in?,3
TAYLORory,,3
LUKE,"And when did it become Taylor's? It said Stars Hollow on the stupid model, and I don't like the extra P and E at the end of shop. Get rid of it!",3
TAYLORory,No.,3
LUKE,"I'm your landlord, Taylor.",3
TAYLORory,"And as a tenant, I have rights. Talk to my lawyer if you disagree.",3

LORELAI,"So, I think I'm in touch with the other side.",3
RORY,The other side of. . .,3
LORELAI,The other side.,3
RORY,With republicans?,3
LORELAI,No. Lately I've been having these dark premonitions.,3
RORY,"Oh, about what?",3
LUKE,"Dead cow, dead cow.",3
LORELAI,That's weird.,3
RORY,He's always weird.,3
LORELAI,"No, I mean, my premonitions have been about death, about my death.",3
RORY,I don't wanna hear this.,3
LORELAI,"And the thing is, they're all silly.",3
RORY,"What do you mean, silly?",3
LORELAI,"In one, I slip on a banana peel and fall into a giant vat of whipped cream.",3
RORY,Silly and fattening.,3
LORELAI,"In another, a turtle eats me.",3
Posted,10/26/02 22:10,3
RORY,"A turtle, how?",3
LORELAI,Very slowly. There's lots of chewing.,3
RORY,"And in your premonition, you didn't run away from what is perhaps the slowest land animal on the earth?",3
LORELAI,His first bite injects me w ith immobilizing poison.,3
RORY,"Well, you left that part out.",3
LORELAI,"Now, this last one's a little more gory. I'm out hunting  ",3
RORY,A favorite Lorelai Gilmore pastime.,3
LORELAI,And my shotgun backfires and my whole face spins around a bunch of times and winds up in the back of my head like Daffy Duck.,3
RORY,That's the silliest one yet.,3
LORELAI,"Now, if that's how I go, you gotta promise to move my face back to the front of my head like Daffy did with his beak.",3
RORY,I should be writing this down.,3
LORELAI,You can rememb er to move my face to the front of my head.,3
RORY,It depends on what I have going on that week.,3
LANE,"Hello Stars Hollow, are you ready to rock?",3
LORELAI,"Let me guess, band practice tonight?",3
LANE,"Yes, we're going to learn our fourth song. That's practically a set.",3
LORELAI,"Hm, I'm imp ressed.",3
LANE,"And then once we have a set, we'll get a gig, and then once we get a gig, we'll get a record deal.",3
LORELAI,Swallow.,3
LANE,"And then after we get a record deal, we'll get really famous and then we'll have to give all of these interviews about how horrible it is to be really famous and how we never wanted this in the first place, all we care about is the music, and fame is gonna tear us apart. It's gonna be great!",3
LORELAI,And rehearsing in the music shop's been working out?,3
LANE,"Perfectly   it's totally time ef ficient, being a thirty-second commute from my house. We practice for two hours, I'm home in time to watch reruns of Johnny Yune's talk show on Korean television with my mom, who thinks I hooked up with you guys   which I did, so I'm not even lying.",3
LORELAI,"Well, you're kinda lying.",3
LANE,"I'm fibbing, but a fib is not a lie.",3
LORELAI,"Hm, I'd say it's a fib-slash-lie.",3
LANE,"No, no, it's not a lie, and I can always tell  cause of the few times that I've out and out lied to my mother, I'd get this feeling in my gut like a wild animal was burrowing into it, and I'm not getting that.",3
LORELAI,Wild animals burrowing into my stomach   another one of my premonitions.,3
RORY,Pretty spooky.,3
LANE,I've gotta go. I'm single-handedly improving the reputation of drummers everywhere by being on time for every rehearsal. Thanks for the food.,3
LORELAI,"Uh, excuse me.",3
RORY,Lane took mine.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, this band thing is really not working out for me. Let's go. See ya, Luke.",3
LUKE,See ya.,3
LORELAI,Turn sideways!,3
LORELAI,That girl's a freak.,3
LUKE,,3
ZACH,"London calling to the faraway towns, now that the w*r's declared and battle come down. London calling to the underworld, come out of the cupboard, you boys and girls. . .",3
DAVE,"Whoa whoa whoa, can you guys hold it? It doesn't sound right.",3
LANE,It sounded good to me.,3
DAVE,"No, it's wrong. Something's missing.",3
ZACH,"Yeah, volume.",3
LANE,"We can't play any louder, guys.",3
ZACH,We've got to.,3
LANE,"But that's the agreement   free practice space, but we have to play quietly.",3
DAVE,"Just try and live with it, Zach.",3
ZACH,"Dude, Brian's breathing is louder than the song.",3
BRIAN,I've got a deviated septum. All the women in my family and me have it.,3
ZACH,"Well, it's throwing me off.",3
LANE,"Hold your breath when we're playing, Brian. There, problem solved. Okay, come on, now, let's rock. One, two, three  ",3
ZACH,Wait. The bottom line here is that breathing should not be louder than a rock band. Am I right or am I right?,3
BRIAN,You're right.,3
ZACH,Rygalski?,3
DAVE,"Well, it  ",3
ZACH,We need to crank it up.,3
LANE,"Just listen harder, that'll make it sound louder.",3
DAVE,Can't we turn it up at all?,3
LANE,"Well, maybe we could possibly turn the amps up from three to, say, three and a half, but that's it.",3
ZACH,Forget it.,3
DAVE,"Zach, come on, we just got started.",3
ZACH,"Dude, Lawrence Welk cranked louder than this. It's a waste of time.",3
LANE,"Wait, Zach, no, you don't understand. We can't play louder. See, my mom has this special antenna that can pick up non-Christian music being played within a football field's distance of our house, and she'd immed iately come looking for me in order to shield me from the perversion.",3
BRIAN,"If Zach's going, I'm going.",3
LANE,"Wait, no, Brian, I'm not exaggerating. Once, a guy in our town named Kirk was practicing Bohemian Rhapsody with his band, the Kirk Gleason Five, and my mom shut them down so fast that the band fled without their instruments and never came back for them. To this day, Kirk can't listen to Queen without tearing up.",3
BRIAN,Sorry.,3
ZACH,"Having a free practice space was cool and all, but not like this.",3
BRIAN,We should just rent a space in Hartford.,3
LANE,"Hartford, Connecticut?",3
ZACH,It's not that far.,3
LANE,"Yeah, or maybe, how  bout France? We could practice in France, too, or Iceland!",3
DAVE,Lane.,3
LANE,"The moon's probably available, we could crank it way up on the moon!",3
DAVE,"A word, please.",3
LANE,"Dave, talk to them. You're the leader, that's flat out insubordination going on in there! They show be flogged, heel-hogged, strung up from the highest yardarm!",3
DAVE,"No, I can't.",3
LANE,Why?,3
DAVE,Because we're supposed to be a one-for-all band like the Clash or U2   it's a democracy.,3
LANE,Democracies are overrated. Now get in there and kick some butt.,3
DAVE,It's not how it works.,3
LANE,I'll fix Brian's deviated septum   I'll ram one of my sticks up his nose!,3
DAVE,"Lane, think about this, do you really believe this is working?",3
LANE,"No, it's not working. We sound like a bunch of wankers.",3
DAVE,We need a real practice space. We need to be able to really play. Wouldn't you like to actually be able to hit both the cymbals?,3
LANE,Yeah.,3
DAVE,"Okay, then, we need to do this.",3
LANE,"I know, I just don't wanna leave the band.",3
DAVE,"What? You can't leave the band. That's not what anybody wants, especially me. Lane, listen to me, okay   you're perfect for us, it's working.",3
LANE,So I have to figure out a way to rehearse in Hartford two or three nights a week.,3
DAVE,"Yeah, that's not so tough.",3
LANE,"No, it's not so tough. And maybe at the same time I'll attempt to master quantum physics, and throw Sanskrit in there, too.",3
DAVE,"Do your best. Not with the Sanskrit thing, that's pretty worthless   but with the band.",3
LANE,I'll try.,3
DAVE,There's no way you're gonna become our Pete Best. There's no way.,3
LANE,You're sweet.,3
DAVE,We should get back in there.,3
LANE,,3
LANE,"Wrack your brain. I mean, we've really gotta think here.",3
RORY,It's quite a pickle.,3
LANE,"No, Rory, pickles are smaller. This is much bigger than a pickle.",3
RORY,"Okay, let's stop saying the word pickle.",3
LANE,Fine.,3
RORY,"Now, how many nights a week would you have to go to Hartford to practice?",3
LANE,"Two, plus a weekend afternoon.",3
RORY,"Okay, so that's three big blocks of time that you'd have to account for.",3
LANE,Very big blocks of time.,3
RORY,"Plus, you have no car to transport your drums anywhere as of yet.",3
LANE,Or a driver's license.,3
RORY,Or any drums because you're borrowing them from the shop.,3
LANE,Temporarily until I can buy my own set   with money that I don't know where I'm gonna get.,3
RORY,"Yup, you're right   that's more than a pickle.",3
LANE,"You're making light   now stop and focus. And turn down the Cornershop, it's distracting.",3
RORY,"No, your Coltrane is distracting, turn that down.",3
LANE,"Hey, I'm in angst here and Coltrane speaks to my soul. I can't turn it down.",3
RORY,"Fine, in deference to your soul, I'll turn mine down. Hey, here's a crazy thought. How about you tell your mom the truth and insist that she lets you play with the band and rehearse in Stars Hollow loudly as long as your schoolwork doesn't suffer?",3
LANE,"Oh, I'm sorry, was that a serious suggestion?",3
RORY,"Hey, it's worth a shot.",3
LANE,"No, you're thinking your mom, here, Rory. If I said that to mine, she'd start waving a crucifix at me.",3
RORY,"If she says no, she says no, but right now you're out of options. We have another call, just think about it?",3
LANE,"Okay, I will. And hey, you know I like Cornershop.",3
RORY,I know. Bye.,3
LANE,Bye.,3
RORY,Hello?,3
DEBBIE,"Hi, Rory?",3
RORY,Yes.,3
DEBBIE,This is Debbie Fincher   Kathy's mom from Stars Hollow High.,3
RORY,"Oh, hi Mrs. Fincher.",3
DEBBIE,"Well, hi right back to you. You know, we miss you since you started that fancy school of yours. Is it fun?",3
RORY,It's hard but I like it.,3
DEBBIE,"Oh well, super. Uh, listen, is your mom home?",3
RORY,"Oh, sure, just a second. Say hi to Kathy for me.",3
DEBBIE,I will.,3
RORY,Hold on.,3
RORY,Phone. It's Debbie Fincher.,3
LORELAI,Who?,3
RORY,From Stars Hollow High. Kathy Fincher's mom.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, I rememb er Kathy.",3
RORY,"You met Debbie many times, had many conversations with her at bake sales, school plays, the PTA.",3
LORELAI,Not ringing a bell.,3
RORY,I used to go swimmin g at her house all the time. You and Debbie had long chats when you dropped me off.,3
LORELAI,No. . .no.,3
RORY,"Blonde hair, medium height, drove a Range Rover.",3
LORELAI,Does she also breathe and have toes?,3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,"Well, narrow it down to less than eight thousand possibilities.",3
RORY,I did with the swimmin g.,3
LORELAI,I rememb er the water.,3
RORY,"Come on, blonde hair, medium height.",3
LORELAI,"See, even you can't think of another way to describe her.",3
RORY,You have no memo ry of this woman?,3
LORELAI,"All those Stars Hollow moms looked alike, except for Lane's mom and that one mom with the freaky glass eye that never moved.",3
RORY,Take the phone.,3
LORELAI,"Hi Debbie, how are you?",3
DEBBIE,"Great, Lorelai, and yourself?",3
LORELAI,"Just fine, thanks.",3
DEBBIE,The g*ng and I have missed you so much at school events. You were always such a kick.,3
LORELAI,"Aw, well, I really miss you and the g*ng.",3
DEBBIE,"Hey, listen, I have a proposition for you. The PTA likes to ask prominent locals in business if they could talk to the students about how they got to where they are   you know, all the hard work it takes, success stories, you know. And we thought about you.",3
LORELAI,"To suggest people I know who have success stories, or. . .",3
DEBBIE,"No, silly, we'd like for you to address the class.",3
LORELAI,"Me, really?",3
DEBBIE,"Well, yes. You're a young woman and you run that beautiful inn, it's a huge responsibility, and you do it with such style.",3
LORELAI,"Wow, well, that's really sweet. It's always nice to be well thought of. Oh, Debbie, before we go any further, I'm dying to know   how's Kathy? What's she up to?",3
DEBBIE,"She is just terrific. She's applied to a couple schools in California, so she's really excited,although. . .",3
LORELAI,So she wants me to speak to some kids about my business success.,3
RORY,Really?,3
LORELAI,Yes.,3
RORY,That's great. What are you doing with the phone?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, she's blabbing about her kid. We probably got another thirty seconds or so.",3
RORY,You're awful.,3
LORELAI,"No, I'm a kick. Should I do it?",3
RORY,"Yeah, toot your own horn, you little missy.",3
LORELAI,"I'm a success, who'd have thought?",3
RORY,I suspected you had it in you.,3
LORELAI,From rags to riches. . .I wonder why Larry King hasn't called.,3
RORY,"Mom, Debbie, please.",3
DEBBIE,". . .so the internship will keep her local, which is a nice bonus for Bill and me, you know?",3
LORELAI,"Oh, sure, yeah. Well, be sure to say hi to her and to Bill, and by the way, yes, I'd be happy to talk to the class.",3
DEBBIE,"Terrific! Oh, the g*ng will be so thrilled. Now, there'll probably be a second speaker with you, do you mind?",3
LORELAI,"Oh, that's fine, who's it gonna be?",3
DEBBIE,"Uh, well, we've had some suggestions, but do you know anyone?",3
LORELAI,"Well, you know, my friend the Sultan of Brunei is so hard to pin down.",3
DEBBIE,"Ha-ha, there's that sense of humor. Well, we were considering Luke Danes, but he usually turns these things down.",3
LORELAI,I could talk to him if you'd like.,3
DEBBIE,That would be just terrific. The two of you together would be a kick.,3
LORELAI,"Well, then, I'll just kick him  til he agrees to do it, how does that sound?",3
DEBBIE,"Okay, Thursday at four p.m., is that okay?",3
LORELAI,"I'll be there, Deb.",3
DEBBIE,"Oh, you rat! You rat!",3
LORELAI,What?,3
DEBBIE,You rememb ered how much I hate being called Deb.,3
LORELAI,I'm wicked.,3
DEBBIE,"Well, thank you Lorelai, and I'll talk to you soon.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, bye. Huh. She hates being called Deb.",3
RORY,I'll make a mental note.,3
LORELAI,"Ow, ow, ow!",3
RORY,,3
LANE,,3
KIM,Lane!,3
LANE,,3
KIM,Come w ith me.,3
LANE,,3
KIM,"Sit, sit. You want tea?",3
LANE,,3
KIM,Sit.,3
LANE,,3
KIM,"Here, I want you to fill these out.",3
LANE,,3
KIM,College applications.,3
LANE,,3
KIM,Don't worry. Every one in this pile approved by me and Reverend Melmin.,3
LANE,,3
KIM,"They're all good religious programs, and I've already thrown out the ones that let boys and girls sit in the cafeteria together, the party schools.",3
LANE,,3
KIM,"I will help you fill them out and we'll mail them on the way to choir practice, okay?",3
LANE,,3
KIM,,3
MICHELorelai,"Hm, your speech for that class?",3
LORELAI,Just some talking points.,3
MICHELorelai,"And this speech is about your success in business, yes?",3
LORELAI,Pretty much.,3
MICHELorelai,You must be very fortunate to live in this tiny town where people make very little money. It elevates you by comparison.,3
LORELAI,Mmhmm.,3
MICHELorelai,I wonder who their last speaker was -- the fellow in short pants that walks up and down the square with a metal detector?,3
LORELAI,"Hm, I wouldn't know.",3
MICHELorelai,"And if they find someone who drives a car that is less than eight years old, what will they do   crown him king of successful people?",3
LORELAI,"Unless it's a woman, and then they'll crown her queen.",3
MICHELorelai,"Mm, and if they are  ",3
LORELAI,"Go away. Independence Inn, Lorelai speaking.",3
LUKE,I'm backing out.,3
LORELAI,"Too late, sorry.",3
LUKE,I'm not speaking to that stupid class.,3
LORELAI,But you agreed.,3
LUKE,"I'm out, case closed, no debating.",3
LORELAI,"Great, fine, do what you want. I guess I'm just out the thousand-dollar deposit.",3
LUKE,What deposit?,3
LORELAI,For the room.,3
LUKE,What room?,3
LORELAI,"For the thing, for the afterwards thing. . .",3
LUKE,"Oh, wait, now, you're talking crazy talk trying to confuse me, aren't you?",3
LORELAI,Aren't you?,3
LUKE,What?,3
LORELAI,Who?,3
LUKE,Stop.,3
LORELAI,Bye.,3
LUKE,"Uh, hold on a sec! I agreed to this under coercion.",3
LORELAI,You said yes on your own.,3
LUKE,I said yes because when I said no you talked baby talk loudly in front of all my customers until I got so sick of it I just agreed to do it to shut you up.,3
LORELAI,I'm incorrigible!,3
LUKE,"It's not a binding agreement, it's coercion.",3
LORELAI,"Well, you gave in just in time because, uh, I was about to transition out of baby talk and into my Louis Armstrong voice, and that, my friend, is a whole lot worse than baby talk.",3
LUKE,I hate that building.,3
LORELAI,"What, the school?",3
LUKE,"Three years of going there, I have no good memories.",3
LORELAI,You must have some.,3
LUKE,None. Kids were as dumb then as they are now.,3
LORELAI,I think you'll enjoy this.,3
LUKE,Think about going back to your high school to give a talk. How would that feel?,3
LORELAI,"Okay, not all your points are bad, but it's not my school, it's your school, and if you cancel, this whole town will know and when you walk down the street people will point and whisper,  There goes that Luke, he's a real talk-canceler guy.'",3
LUKE,Ouch.,3
LORELAI,"Plus, I promised the PTA, so my fragile reputation is on the line.",3
LUKE,I think you'll live.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, Luke.",3
LUKE,No!,3
LORELAI,"Hello, Dolly!",3
LUKE,Stop that.,3
LORELAI,"This is Louis, Dolly!",3
LUKE,I'll just hang up.,3
LORELAI,I'll be coming  round the diner singing soooooooongs.,3
LUKE,Have you been diagnosed?,3
LORELAI,,3
LANE,"Oh, it was a fine collection, believe me.",3
RORY,She made you apply to every one?,3
LANE,And measured my head for a wimple.,3
RORY,"Out of twenty-three schools, there wasn't one that you might want to go to?",3
LANE,"It depends on what I'm looking for. Of course, all the great Seventh Day Adventist schools were represented, with their ban on dancing, gum chewing and bowling. Quaker College was a delightful surprise, with its special appeal to Richard Nixon, who's dead but still deeply involved in campus recruiting. Oh, and the piece de resistance! She found an Amish school in Nicaragua. Nicaragua! A big shout out to Mama Kim on that one!",3
RORY,"Look, Mama Kim always starts out super serious on everything but then lightens with time.",3
LANE,"But I don't have time. Schools that I like will fill up and my band, my beloved band, will find another drummer , and if it's a girl I'm gonna be twice as mad.",3
RORY,"Look, Lane, just try to calm down.",3
LANE,"No, calm is for losers. I've spent my whole life compromising and being the good little girl and not doing what I want. Or doing what I want and hiding it and feeling guilty for doing it, andI'm sick of it. I'm sick of it. I mean, I even lost my first boyfriend because of all this.",3
RORY,What boyfriend?,3
LANE,Henry.,3
RORY,"Oh, right, Henry.",3
LANE,"See, that's how pathetic my life is. I'm calling a boyfriend a guy that I never even went out on a date with, and that my own best friend doesn't even remember, which is not your fault because there's nothing to rememb er.",3
RORY,"Okay, so besides power walking, what are you gonna do about it?",3
LANE,Take a stand!,3
RORY,,3
RORY,Lane.,3
LANE,Follow my anger.,3
RORY,What are you doing?,3
LANE,Choosing a color.,3
RORY,You're gonna dye your hair?,3
LANE,"Yes, I am. Lots of choices here. Help me narrow it down.",3
RORY,You can't do this.,3
LANE,Of course I can.,3
RORY,"And what, walk around in a hood all the time? How are you gonna hide this from your mom?",3
LANE,"I'm not gonna hide it, that's the point.",3
RORY,"Lane, think about this for a second, at least.",3
LANE,"Rory, I've been thinking about this my whole life. Nothing's gonna change unless I change it, and now's the time. I need to make a clear statement, one I can't go back on or chicken out on, one that everyone can see. And this is my instrument, it says  This is me, this is Lane Kim.'",3
RORY,"That is you, it's black hair dye.",3
LANE,"This is merely a prop until we find my true color. Now, what do you think? Pink? Or is that too Pink the singer and Kelly Osbourne and Gwen Stefani. . .man, there's a lot of cheese associated with the color pink. Okay, pink's out. There. . .there's blue   what about blue?",3
RORY,"Blue's probably not right for your skin tone, and I agree with you about pink. What aboutpurple?",3
LANE,"Yes, purple, you're brilliant.",3
RORY,"And bleach, don't forget the bleach.",3
LANE,"Bleach, right, okay, I'll get the bleach. Thank you.",3
RORY,And make sure that you get some. . . gloves.,3
LANE,Got them.,3
RORY,"Good, good.",3
LANE,You all right?,3
RORY,"Yeah, fine, let's go.",3
LANE,"It's a good day today, isn't it?",3
SHANE,Mmhmm. Twelve fifty-two.,3
LANE,And I've got exact change for you.,3
SHANE,Super. You need something?,3
RORY,"No. No, I just, um. . . I was wondering if there's a money-back guarantee. You know, in case her hair falls out or something.",3
SHANE,"Um, sure. If your hair falls out, we'll give you your money back.",3
RORY,"Good. You heard that. The second you go bald, you can come get your money back.",3
LANE,"Rory, you're putting a damper on my Independence Day.",3
RORY,,3
LORELAI,"Lucas, la escuela!",3
LUKE,Hey.,3
LORELAI,Hey. Did you lose track of time?,3
LUKE,What? Why?,3
LORELAI,It's four o'clock.,3
LUKE,I know.,3
LORELAI,"We were supposed to be at the school, like, now.",3
LUKE,I know.,3
LORELAI,But you're not ready.,3
LUKE,"What? Oh, right, right, sorry. Okay, I'm ready.",3
LORELAI,Au contraire.,3
LUKE,What?,3
LORELAI,You are so not ready.,3
LUKE,What are you talking about?,3
LORELAI,The grunge look is out.,3
LUKE,"Hey, I'm not dressing up for this.",3
LORELAI,"Well, you need something better than that.",3
LUKE,The whole point of this stupid class talk was for us to talk about our work and our success. This flannel shirt is my most successful outfit. I've closed many a deal in this outfit. It's my power outfit.,3
LORELAI,Come on.,3
LUKE,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, let go, let go, hey, you're pinching me!",3
LORELAI,Go!,3
LUKE,I don't wanna change.,3
LORELAI,Be a good boy and I'll buy you a toy afterward. You wanna toy?,3
LORELAI,Sorry to barge in.,3
JESS,No problem. What was that about a toy?,3
LORELAI,Your Uncle Luke is getting one if he's a good boy.,3
LUKE,"Can we make this more demeaning? Hey, why don't you go downstairs and help out Caesar?",3
JESS,"I think my education comes first, don't you?",3
LORELAI,Oh my God.,3
LUKE,What?,3
LORELAI,Jimmy Buffett?,3
LUKE,Put that back.,3
LORELAI,You like Jimmy Buffett? He's so mellow.,3
LUKE,"I've just been to a few shows, that's all.",3
LORELAI,"A few shows? Oh my God, you're a Buffetthead.",3
LUKE,Is that the one you want me to wear or not?,3
LORELAI,Sing Margaritaville.,3
LUKE,No.,3
JESS,That attitude's gonna lose you that toy.,3
LUKE,Stay outta this!,3
LORELAI,We've got ourselves a winner.,3
LUKE,"Fine, fine, come on.",3
LORELAI,Just change in here.,3
LUKE,I'll be more comfortable in here.,3
LORELAI,I've seen you swimmin g at the lake so I've seen you with your shirt off.,3
JESS,Lately?  Cause he's really let himself go.,3
LUKE,I'll be one second.,3
LORELAI,"Lose the baseball cap, too.",3
JESS,You run the risk of his head falling off without it.,3
LORELAI,I think he'll be okay.,3
JESS,Something wrong?,3
LORELAI,"Uh, no. . .no, I just. . .no.",3
LUKE,Happy?,3
LORELAI,Thrilled. Now a tie with that would be just great.,3
LUKE,We're leaving. And it's gotta be something I don't have to put together.,3
LORELAI,What?,3
LUKE,My toy.,3
LORELAI,Got it.,3
JESS,Talk good.,3
LORELAI,"Wow, we're late. Oh, by the way, Jess had a girl in the closet.",3
LUKE,What?,3
LORELAI,"Come on, pip pip!",3
LUKE,,3
LANE,"Okay, combs, rags, instructions, timer, towels, tunes.",3
RORY,All systems a go.,3
LANE,"So far, so good.",3
RORY,"Now, are you sure about this?",3
LANE,Will you stop?,3
RORY,I'm just making sure.,3
LANE,I'll sign a waiver if you want. Hit play please.,3
RORY,"We should open a window, shouldn't we?",3
LANE,It's freezing outside.,3
RORY,"Yeah, but the bleach is gonna stink up the whole house.",3
LANE,Let it. Let it be the first clue that something's happened for when my mom gets home. Let the thick smell of bleach meet her at the doorway like a force that'll usher her into the next chapter of Lane Kim's life. The smell of bleach is the smell of freedom!,3
RORY,You're very dramatic today.,3
LANE,"To hell with the floor! Oh, that felt good to say.",3
RORY,You done?,3
LANE,I'm done.,3
RORY,"Take your seat, please. And here we go. How you doing?",3
LANE,Fine.,3
RORY,Feeling good?,3
LANE,"Feeling great. This is such a catharsis. I have never felt so naturally high in my life. Stings a little, though.",3
RORY,"Yeah, that happens.",3
LANE,"But just a little, no biggie. More than a little actually, it's kind of a big little.",3
RORY,Just keep me posted.,3
LANE,"In that case, it's kind of a lot. Yup, yup, a lot of sting happening here.",3
RORY,"Try thinking about something else. God, this smells awful.",3
LANE,"Okay, thinking about something else, something else. Thinking about puppy dogs. Thinking about getting things in the mail. I love getting things in the mail, letters and packages.",3
RORY,Got a package.,3
LANE,What's that?,3
RORY,"Oh, Jim Car rey says that in Ace Ventura.",3
LANE,"Good distraction. Still thinking. . .thinking about world events, lots going on there. Thinking about the last movie I saw. Vin Diesel was in it. Thinking about Vin Diesel now. Thinking about where Vin Diesel got the name Vin Diesel. Thinking about Vin Diesel's mysterious ethnicity. Thinking about how surprising it is to have so much to think about with Vin Diesel. Who knew, who knew? Okay, now I'm just thinking about the pain, we're into pain here.",3
RORY,Back to Vin Diesel.,3
LANE,"I've exhausted Vin Diesel, but the pain   that's not exhausted!",3
RORY,What kind of pain is it?,3
LANE,"Ever light your head on fire? I haven't, but I don't have to now  cause I know how it feels.",3
RORY,I'll rinse it out.,3
LANE,"No, we'd have to start all over again and now that I know how much pain there is, I'll chicken out for sure!",3
RORY,I'm getting dizzy from the smell.,3
LANE,"Let's focus on my pain. Now read the bottle, tell me what to do in case of pain.",3
RORY,"Um, blah blah blah, do not apply to a broken scalp   is your scalp broken?",3
LANE,"I don't know, maybe. I don't know my scalp that well.",3
RORY,"There's nothing else about pain. Oh, a girl told me once that if your scalp is hurting from bleach, drink a 7UP. It's something to do with the bubbles.",3
LANE,The Kim household does not have soft drinks.,3
RORY,"Well, what do you got?",3
LANE,"Something called Salad Water imported from Korea. Believe me, it's nothing like 7UP.",3
RORY,"Oh my God, we have to open this window.",3
LANE,"Okay, I have got to do something!",3
RORY,Run around the block!,3
LANE,Why?,3
RORY,I don't know!,3
LANE,,3
DEBBIE,"It's so good of you both to do this, really.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, we're happy to be here, right?",3
LUKE,"Yup, zippity doo dah.",3
DEBBIE,"Oh, Luke, it must be fun to be back at your old alma mater, huh?",3
LUKE,"Oh yeah, I'm feeling all warm and fuzzy here.",3
LORELAI,"Don't let him fool you. He told me he was so excited about today, he couldn't sleep last night.",3
DEBBIE,"Oh, we're all excited, too. It's been so long since we saw you, Lorelai. We had some laughs with this one, let me tell you.",3
LUKE,"Oh yeah, she's a funny one.",3
DEBBIE,The book fair of  97. . .what you said to that one rude customer   uh! Priceless how you put him in his place.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, I put that man in his place, all right, zing!",3
DEBBIE,"Oh oh oh, what you said to him! How could anyone forget?",3
LORELAI,"Huh, yeah.",3
DEBBIE,"Hey, Old Man. . .",3
LORELAI,. . .old man. . .,3
DEBBIE,Stick a crowbar -,3
LORELAI,. . .crowbar. . .,3
DEBBIE,- in your wallet -,3
LORELAI,. . . in his wallet. . .,3
DEBBIE,- and cough up some dough -,3
LORELAI,. . .dough. . .,3
DEBBIE,-  cause this is for our kids!,3
LORELAI,. . .our kids! Ha ha!,3
DEBBIE,You do rememb er!,3
LORELAI,"What, it's emblazoned up here Debbie, all those good times.",3
DEBBIE,"Definitely. Now everyone's gathered. The vice-principal will finish up in a second and then we'll call you in. Lorelai, you wanna go first?",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, sure. Is that okay?",3
LUKE,It's okay by me.,3
DEBBIE,Great. See you in a minute.,3
LORELAI,I couldn't pick that woman out of a lineup if my life depended on it.,3
LORELAI,Will you lighten up?,3
LUKE,"No, I won't lighten up.",3
LORELAI,Aw.,3
LUKE,"I hate this place. Still smells the same   old, repressive.",3
LORELAI,Being back here doesn't make you nostalgic at all?,3
LUKE,"I liked the final bell, that's about it. What are those?",3
LORELAI,"They're, uh, my notes for the talk.",3
LUKE,You put thought into this?,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, don't you have notes?",3
LUKE,"I run a diner, what are my notes? I open the door, people come in, they order food, I cook the food, I serve the food, they eat the food. Then there's a terrific action sequence where I refill coffee and water. And oh, my big finale is a description of the whole end of the evening mopping up ceremony.",3
LORELAI,"Hey, you're sure you don't mind me going first?",3
LUKE,Are you kidding? There's a good chance you'll yack so much they won't even get to me.,3
LORELAI,Oh my God.,3
LUKE,What?,3
LORELAI,"Nothing, nothing at all, Butch.",3
LUKE,For the love of. . .what's that doing there?,3
LORELAI,"What's it doing? It's yelling,  Mock me, mock me!'",3
LUKE,It shouldn't be there.,3
LORELAI,"Oh no, you're right. It should have its own special display at the diner with a big old spotlight on it.",3
LUKE,Don't they need my permission for this? This should be illegal.,3
LORELAI,"No, those shorts with that t*nk top should be illegal.",3
LUKE,"Okay, stop now.",3
LORELAI,"What was your girlfriend's name, Sissy?",3
LUKE,"As a matter of fact, no.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, the girls just swooned when Butch Danes took the field.",3
LUKE,I knew there was another good reason not to do this.,3
LORELAI,,3
LANE,It's weird.,3
RORY,Like straw.,3
LANE,I feel like I should be singing  If I Only Had a Brain.',3
RORY,"Now, you feel better? Burning's completely gone?",3
LANE,Completely. I even think the Salad Water's helping.,3
RORY,"Okay, here goes nothing. So have you mentioned dyeing your hair to the band yet?",3
LANE,"No, but they'll be cool with it. They've all got tattoos. Dave and Zach have musical themes and Brian's got Snoopy.",3
RORY,Poor guy.,3
LANE,"Yeah, but he's a slammin g bass player.",3
RORY,So you haven't even mentioned it to Dave?,3
LANE,I just said I didn't tell the band.,3
RORY,Not even Dave?,3
LANE,"No, not even to Dave. And what's with all the pressing?",3
RORY,"I don't know, Dave's just different from the other two.",3
LANE,"Of course, he's the defacto leader.",3
RORY,"I know, but it also seemed like from the day you guys met there was a little something happening there.",3
LANE,I don't know what you're talking about.,3
RORY,"You're always talking about him. You always seem to be thinking about him. And now with this hair emancipation of yours, you're going to unheard of lengths to make a statement to your mother about who you are so you can have a shot at staying in the band   all roads lead to Dave.",3
LANE,"Rory, Dave and I are professionals.",3
RORY,I know.,3
LANE,"Plus, the rock and roll highway is littered with casualties of band members who have dated and broken the band apart.",3
RORY,That's a sensible attitude.,3
LANE,"Very sensible, very sensible. Dave and I are very sensible people. I'm in love with him.",3
RORY,I know.,3
LANE,Is it that obvious?,3
RORY,Only to a guy with sunglasses and a dog selling pencils.,3
LANE,He's so cute.,3
RORY,Definitely cute.,3
LANE,"And smart   you know, that's such a rare package. It's usually one or the other.",3
RORY,"It's wrong, but that's the way it usually is.",3
LANE,It just increases the amount of competition for the Daves of the world.,3
RORY,"You're rare, too, don't forget.",3
LANE,"I've never really felt this way before. I mean, Henry   yes, but we never spent any real time together. It's not just puppy love, you know, it's different. I mean, I get butterflies in my stomach when I think about him, and when I call him to work out times for band practice, the ring of his telephone gets me really excited. And last week, someone said Dave at school   it wasn't even about my Dave, and I almost lost it, I got so shaky.",3
RORY,My Dave   that's so cute.,3
LANE,Stop it.,3
RORY,This sounds like love to me.,3
LANE,"It does, doesn't it? My first love, wow.",3
RORY,"Yeah, wow.",3
LANE,"I finally have a first love, like what you and Dean have.",3
RORY,Right. . . exactly.,3
LANE,"Of course, I don't exactly have what you and Dean have because you love Dean and Dean loves you back. In my situation, I love Dave and Dave thinks that I have a decent sense of rhythm.",3
RORY,"Don't move, you'll drip.",3
LANE,"God, you're so lucky   to love a guy who actually knows you love him and who loves you back. That's gotta be the best feeling ever.",3
RORY,I think this purple's gonna look good.,3
LANE,I want that. I want that really bad.,3
RORY,You'll have that. You will have your perfect first love and second love and any other love you want because you're great and purple heads will not be denied.,3
LANE,Now that should've been put on the box.,3
RORY,,3
DEBBIE,"Okay, we're all ready for you guys.",3
LORELAI,"Great, excellent.",3
DEBBIE,"Okay, uh, Luke, you can have a seat here while Lorelai's talking, okay?",3
LUKE,Okay.,3
LORELAI,"Hey, what's that? Luke plus Sissy.",3
LUKE,Start your speech.,3
DEBBIE,"Okay, everyone, we're ready to begin. We have two local luminaries here to talk to us today. You probably all recognize Luke Danes from his fabulous diner, but we're really excited to begin with a former Stars Hollow High mom, Lorelai Gilmore.",3
LORELAI,"No, no, save it for when I wow you with my brilliance. I'm really happy to be here with you all today. I recognize a lot of you from over the years and you're all getting taller and older   stop it. Anyhow, as some of you know, I run the Independence Inn. Sounds simple, running an inn. Well, the sentence is simple, the job is not. Like most jobs, mine involves many other people, people it is my job to hire, to train, and to inspire because when you have good employees it makes you look good. Oh, questions already   are questions okay?",3
DEBBIE,They're encouraged.,3
LORELAI,"Yes? GIRL 1: You're Rory Gilmore's mom, aren't you?",3
LORELAI,"Yes I am, and proud of it. GIRL 1: Oh.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, is that it? Well, I hope all your questions are that easy. Okay, now, why is it necessary to inspire employees? Why can't you just train them and let them do their jobs? Well. . .yes? GIRL 2: Didn't you get pregnant when you were sixteen?",3
LORELAI,"Um, sixteen. . .it was around that age. Sixteen, that sounds right. Okay. Different people working for you will have different needs. . .yeah?",3
BOY,"Well, what about school?",3
LORELAI,School? I'm sorry.,3
BOY,Did you drop out when you got pregnant with Rory?,3
LORELAI,"No, technically, I didn't drop out. I, uh, I kept going as long as I could while I got pregnant, which I would recommen d to any girl. Not the getting pregnant part, obviously. Um, although, uh, if that happens, um, you know. . . it shouldn't. I mean, it could but you should try to avoid it. . . um, anyway, uh, I got my GED, yeah.",3
DEBBIE,"Lorelai, why don't we move this along?",3
LORELAI,"Yes, oh, moving it along, moving it along. Okay, okay, okay. Boy, I should've been more organized here. GIRL 1: Well, are you sorry you got pregnant?",3
LORELAI,"No, it brought me Rory, but timing is everything. I mean, I could've. . .sixteen, you guys are sixteen, right . . .and hey, is that clock right? GIRL 3: What do you mean by timing? GIRL 1: Yeah, if you had waited and had a baby with another man at a different time. . . GIRL 4: It wouldn't have been Rory, right?",3
LORELAI,"Hey, you know what's fun to talk about? Late checkout. GIRL 2: But it was good you got pregnant when you did because you got Rory.",3
LORELAI,,3
RORY,What?,3
LANE,"It's perfect, I love it.",3
RORY,"Well, stop primping and get out here. Whoa.",3
LANE,It's everything I hoped it would be.,3
RORY,It's very rock and roll.,3
LANE,We've gotta take a picture.,3
RORY,Get the camera.,3
LANE,I am a Kodak picture spot.,3
LANE,Should I scowl or smile?,3
RORY,Surprise me.,3
LANE,This is the most radical thing a Kim has done since my cousin Nam got caught reading Maxim at summer camp.,3
RORY,"That must be your mom. Lane? Lane, you're turning white. What's wrong? Lane!",3
LANE,I can't do this.,3
RORY,Can't do what?,3
LANE,Dye my hair.,3
RORY,"Um, it's kinda too late.",3
LANE,This is gonna k*ll her.,3
RORY,"It won't k*ll her, it'll just shock her.",3
LANE,"But the shock will k*ll her and then she'll k*ll me, we're talking bloodbath here. We've gotta put it back.",3
RORY,Put it back?,3
LANE,"Back to black, right now, hurry! Go, go!",3
RORY,Go where?,3
LANE,Back to the store to get the black hair dye.,3
RORY,No!,3
LANE,Yes!,3
RORY,No!,3
LANE,Yes!,3
RORY,This is insane.,3
LANE,"Rory, I just drank a gallon of liquid salad. Insanity is a daily staple at the Kim house. Go, go!",3
RORY,"Okay, I'm going.",3
LANE,Where are you going?,3
RORY,You're messing with my mind here.,3
LANE,"You can't go out that way, my mom will see you.",3
RORY,"My head is my normal color, she can see me.",3
LANE,"But if she sees you, she'll come looking for me.",3
RORY,You owe me.,3
LANE,,3
SHANE,"Uh huh. . .All I know is I don't have it, so it's gotta be at your place. . .You're not looking for it, you're watching TV, I can tell. . .Yeah, whatever. I'll just get a new one. So, what are we doing tonight? . . . I don't know, I'm sick of eating. I've been eating like a pig, I feel all bloaty. . . It is so a word, it's a word  cause I said it. That's how words get invented,  cause people say them and then other people say them. . . You're such a jerk sometimes and I'm always nice to you. . .",3
RORY,Excuse me?,3
SHANE,I get off at the same boring time.,3
RORY,Excuse me?,3
SHANE,Yeah?,3
RORY,I don't have all day.,3
SHANE,Hold on a sec. Will this be all?,3
RORY,"Yeah, that'll be all. I'm growing a beard here.",3
SHANE,What's your problem?,3
RORY,"What's your problem? I'm a customer, I'm in a hurry, and you're supposed to assist me.",3
SHANE,I am assisting you.,3
RORY,"Yeah, after you took your sweet time getting off the phone, which by the way, clearly was not a business call.",3
SHANE,Un-freaking-believable.,3
RORY,"Yeah, it is, it is. The level of service in this place is just that   un-freaking-believable.",3
SHANE,Have a nice day.,3
RORY,"Yeah, thanks, you too. And by the way, bloaty is not a word. There's bloated, there's bloating, but no bloaty.",3
SHANE,"Thanks, that's fascinating.",3
RORY,,3
LORELAI,Don't.,3
LUKE,"I'm trying not to, I swear. I'm not trying hard, I'll grant you that.",3
LORELAI,"What was with those kids? So curious, so full of questions. Shouldn't their brains be completely fried on TV and video games by now?",3
LORELAI,It wasn't funny.,3
LUKE,"Not from your angle. From min e, it was an evening at the Improv.",3
LORELAI,I'm not gonna be allowed within a mile of the school ever again.,3
LUKE,"On the positive side, you did me a favor. Now I have a pleasant memory from that school   you being nailed like a two by four by a group of sixteen-year-olds.",3
LORELAI,"Oh no, what's this?",3
LUKE,Looks like high noon in Stars Hollow.,3
LORELAI,"They're not carrying tar and feathers, are they?",3
LORELAI,"Oh, hi everybody. Wow, the whole g*ng. What's up?",3
DEBBIE,"Well, I felt obligated to tell the other moms about your little performance at school before they heard about it elsewhere.",3
LORELAI,"Really,  cause usually I like to meet up at Sardi's after a performance, wait for the reviews. I hope The Times liked me. Nothing, huh? LADY 1: So, you're preaching to our daughters that it's okay to get pregnant at sixteen, am I getting that right?",3
LORELAI,"No, not at all, I was just answering their questions. LADY 1: Well, it's your answers we didn't like.",3
LORELAI,"Hey, I was talking about my job like I was supposed to, but your kids kept asking about my pregnancy. What was I supposed to do?",3
DEBBIE,"Fend them off, change the subject!",3
LORELAI,"I tried, Debbie, but they kept coming at me like I was Poland and they were Nazis. Rememb er the old days, girls, when I used to make you laugh? LADY 2: There's nothing funny about this.",3
LORELAI,"Their questions just threw me off, that's all. LADY 1: Sounds like you just flaunted your mistakes.",3
LORELAI,"Now, hold on. You have no right to judge me. All I said was that for my particular circumstances things worked out okay. I advocated nothing to them. You're all acting like I walked into that room tossing condoms in the air. LADY 2: You might as well have.",3
LORELAI,"Fine, next time I will. I'll bring a banana and we'll have a little show and tell. How  bout that? LADY 1: What kind of mother are you?",3
LORELAI,The kind that doesn't gloss over things just because they're a little uncomfortable.,3
DEBBIE,This whole incident was awkward and unnecessary.,3
LORELAI,"No, Deb, I'd say, Deb, that what's awkward and unnecessary, Deb, is that you all seem to go to the same lousy hairdresser. How  bout mixing it up a little, huh, girls?",3
LUKE,I gotta get going. You good here?,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, yeah, I'm good.",3
DEBBIE,You don't have to take that tone.,3
LORELAI,,3
LUKE,Hey.,3
JESS,Hey. So what's going on out there?,3
LUKE,"Ah, just Lorelai. . .dealing with some women about something or other. So we did that thing at the school today. Yeah, it went pretty well. All the kids seemed relatively unarmed. Yeah, I just told them about the diner and cooking things, and I expect kids all over town will rush out tomorrow and buy a spatula.",3
JESS,Checking for monsters?,3
LUKE,"Oh, no, just. . .",3
JESS,Just what?,3
LUKE,Just didn't wanna accidentally bump into someone in there.,3
JESS,What are you talking about?,3
LUKE,"Jess, did you have a girl stashed in there before?",3
JESS,Before what?,3
LUKE,"Lorelai said you were hiding someone here earlier, she said a girl   were you?",3
JESS,Yes.,3
LUKE,"Jess, you don't shove a girl in a closet.",3
JESS,I did not shove her in the closet. She got in voluntarily.,3
LUKE,"Oh, sure.",3
JESS,"Look, Shane freaked when she heard you guys coming. Next thing I know, she's in there. I personally didn't care if you guys saw us or not, but hey   women, right? You can't live with them, you can't keep them from jumping in the closet.",3
LUKE,"Uh, you and I have got to have a little talk.",3
JESS,"Hey, if you're gonna get all Ward Cleaver on me, I gotta go call Eddie and Lumpy and tell them I'm gonna be late.",3
LUKE,"Shut up for a second, would ya? Look, I know you're at an age where the whole girl thing is. . .you know, on your mind a lot, and it's probably not helping you to think straight with all the hormones and other things that are raging around in there. My point is that you gotta think about things a little better, you know, the way you act. I mean, if you care about a girl the way you do with this Shane  ",3
JESS,I don't care about her.,3
LUKE,What?,3
JESS,I don't even know her last name.,3
LUKE,You're kidding.,3
JESS,She mentioned it once. It didn't stick.,3
LUKE,"Well, if you don't care about her, what are you doing with her?",3
JESS,"Just hanging with her, no biggie.",3
LUKE,"Well, you gotta be doing something more than hanging with her. I mean, you got to at least be doing something with her to make her jump in a closet when people come into the room.",3
JESS,"Relax, will ya? All is good.",3
LUKE,"Jess, this isn't right. You can't treat a girl like this, like dirt!",3
JESS,"If it's any consolation to you, she treats me like dirt, too. It's a pretty symbiotic relationship.",3
LUKE,And that's fine with you?,3
JESS,"Yes, it is.",3
LUKE,"To just go along in a relationship, you treat somebody bad and they treat you bad back.",3
JESS,That's right.,3
LUKE,"Oh, that makes you happy?",3
JESS,I'd do backflips but I am way too cool.,3
LUKE,That makes absolutely no sense.,3
JESS,It doesn't have to make sense to you.,3
LUKE,"There are plenty other of girls out there in the world, Jess.",3
JESS,Don't you have to get back to the diner?,3
LUKE,"I mean, you can go out and at least find one that you actually care about.",3
JESS,"Oh, like it's that easy.",3
LUKE,"Yeah, it's that easy if you try.",3
JESS,"Hey, the girls that I like don't give a damn about me! And unlike some other people I know, I'm not gonna sit around hoping that they change their minds and suddenly notice me.",3
LUKE,What's that supposed to mean?,3
JESS,You fixed any neighbor's porches lately? Or you go on a picnic or you get rooked into giving a ridiculous speech at a high school?,3
LUKE,Shut up.,3
JESS,At least I've got a little self-esteem.,3
LUKE,Shut up.,3
JESS,"I'm not playing Golden Retriever, hoping one day she'll turn around and fall in my arms. If she doesn't wanna be with me, then fine.",3
LUKE,You have no idea what you're talking about.,3
JESS,"Whatever. I gotta go, Shane's waiting.",3
LUKE,"Oh, you mean what's-her-name?",3
JESS,"Yeah, I'll bring you a new leash when I get back.",3
LUKE,,3
LANE,"Busy day, busy day.",3
RORY,I'm pretty exhausted.,3
LANE,I guess it was just too big of a statement for me to make right now.,3
RORY,"Maybe. Oh, hey, I just thought of something.",3
LANE,What?,3
RORY,"Technically, you have dyed hair.",3
LANE,"I do, don't I?",3
RORY,Yup.,3
LANE,"I mean, dyed my natural color, yes   but dyed nonetheless.",3
RORY,Not one strand of real color on that head of yours.,3
LANE,"So, I guess that means we can score this as a victory, right?",3
RORY,"Absolutely, put it in the victory column.",3
SHANE,That girl's a freak.,3
LANE,What was that about?,3
RORY,It's been a very long day.,3
LORELAI,"Ah, people who like me, great.",3
RORY,How was your talk at the school?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, just peachy. Is your hair blacker?",3
LANE,Uh oh.,3
RORY,"Oh, I wish you hadn't have said that. It's not noticeable, but just stay out of bright lighting.",3
LORELAI,What happened?,3
LANE,I dyed my hair.,3
LORELAI,Uh!,3
LANE,"Then I dyed it back, but for a full thirty minutes, I looked like this.",3
LORELAI,"Whoa, you look cool! You're insane.",3
LANE,"I got sane again, but I will always have that picture. Oh, uh, hide it at your place?",3
LORELAI,Will do.,3
LANE,"I gotta go. And rememb er, we still need a plan.",3
LORELAI,"Yes, we do.",3
LORELAI,Why do we need a plan?,3
RORY,A plan so that Lane doesn't have to quit her band.,3
LORELAI,Lane can't quit the band! She has to get famous and introduce me to Bono.,3
RORY,I told her that.,3
LORELAI,"All right, let's go eat. . .see if we can figure out a way to salvage my future as a groupie.",3
RORY,Sounds good.,3
LORELAI,Let's go to Al's Pancake World for a change. He's doing a salute to Jamaica again.,3
RORY,,3
LORELAI,We'll hide his mallets when he's not looking.,3
RORY,"So, come on, tell me how the talk went.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, it was great. It was one minute on my success in the business world, and that went very well. And it was ten minutes on the possibility that if I had had sex with a different man at a different time in my life, you wouldn't have been born.",3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,I kind of got off on a tangent.,3
RORY,A big one. How did that happen?,3
LORELAI,I'll tell you about it at Al's. Just don't expect to be invited to any more swim parties at Kathy Fincher's house.,3
RORY,"Well, don't wait  til Al's. Tell me now.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, I just love my little fluke.",3
RORY,"Come on, what happened?",3

LORELAI,"And the rabbit says,  How about that schnitzel!' Well?",3
RORY,Well what? There's no punchline.,3
LORELAI,That is the punchline.,3
RORY, How about that schnitzel!'   that's the punchline?,3
LORELAI,"Well, no, not when you say it like that.",3
RORY,How am I supposed to say it?,3
LORELAI,Like a punchline.,3
RORY,How about that schnitzel!,3
LORELAI,"Oh, forget it.",3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,You ruined my joke.,3
RORY,"Um, no, the punchline ruined your joke.",3
LORELAI,Ha!,3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,You admit it's a punchline.,3
RORY,Oh my God.,3
LORELAI,"Ha, I am vindicated.  How about that schnitzel!' has officially been declared a punchline.",3
Posted,11/03/02 10:27,3
RORY,A really bad punchline.,3
LORELAI,No one asked for the Norton Critical Edition. All the schnitzel and I wanted was some recognition and now we have it.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, man, it's packed in here.",3
RORY,I guess we counter it.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, I guess we do.",3
LUKE,What?,3
LORELAI,"What do you know, your face really can freeze that way.",3
RORY,Are you okay?,3
LUKE,"Yeah, I'm fine, I'm great. It's a big fat happy sunshine day for me.",3
LORELAI,Business looks good.,3
RORY,"Yeah, the place is packed.",3
LUKE,"Sure, it's been taken over by the J. Crew catalog.",3
RORY,"Oh, look, babies!",3
LORELAI,I never wanna hear that come out of your mouth again.,3
WOMAN,Find the yellow ball.,3
MAN,"Yellow ball, yellow ball, yellow ball. . .ah, yellow duck.",3
WOMAN,Ball.,3
MAN,"Yellow ball, yellow ball, yellow ball.",3
LUKE,"Every weekend, the same stupid group comes in here and take up all my tables and every chair they can get their sticky hands on, and they do that. They sit, they stand, one person holds the kid, another person holds the kid. MAN 2: I've got Choo-Choo Joe.",3
LUKE,"This guy runs in and out and back and forth, the other guy never takes his head out of that stupid bag, the women can't figure out which kid is which, and they do it all morning long, and then order two iced teas to go, and that is it.",3
LORELAI,I'm sure you're exaggerating.,3
LUKE,I am not exaggerating.WOMAN 2: Oh god.,3
LUKE,"Oh, now, this is good, you see   Choo-Choo Joe will not be working. WOMAN 2: Get the Bongo Bear. Get the Bongo Bear.",3
RORY,How'd you know that?,3
LUKE,"Because Joe has not been working for the last six months. Personally, I don't think he's broken, I think he k*lled himself to get away from that family.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, now that kid's a major drooler.",3
RORY,"Yeah, it's like a fountain.",3
LUKE,"Okay, that's it, they have to go.",3
LORELAI,"Luke, come on, it's just spit. Pretend you're at a baseball game.",3
LUKE,"No no no, I've had enough. Let them go not spend money at Al's, I'm through.",3
LUKE,Is that woman doing what I think she's doing?,3
LORELAI,"Um, well, I can't be a hundred percent sure, but. . .oh yeah, that's lunch.",3
LUKE,"Why, why do they do this? This is a public place, people are eating here.",3
RORY,They sure are.,3
LUKE,This cannot be sanitary.,3
LORELAI,I agree. You don't know where that thing's been.,3
LUKE,"When did that become ac ceptable? In the old days, a woman would never consider doing that in public. They'd go find a barn or a cave or something. I mean, it's indecent. This is a diner not a peep show!",3
LORELAI,"Hey, consider making it a combo. You could charge more for your cheeseburgers. Of course, no one would ever feel the same ordering a glass of milk again, but . . .",3
LUKE,I have to do something. I just can't stand here and let the lactating continue.,3
LORELAI,Luke.,3
RORY,Gross!,3
LUKE,I'm gross? I'm not the one exposing myself for the entire world to see. That's it.,3
LUKE,You go make her stop.,3
LORELAI,I'm not going over there.,3
LUKE,Why not? You're a woman.,3
LORELAI,So what?,3
LUKE,So you have the same parts.,3
LORELAI,What?,3
LUKE,You shouldn't be scared of it.,3
LORELAI,"Scared of it? You know, you're gonna be a bachelor for a really long time.",3
LUKE,"I am being taken advantage of here, and I do not like being taken advantage of. I hate this!",3
JESS,Oh geez!,3
LUKE,,3
LORELAI,"Aw, is it your nap time?",3
MICHELorelai,The Tylers in twelve asked to have their toxic pillows removed.,3
LORELAI,Our pillows aren't toxic.,3
MICHELorelai,"According to the complimentary travel magazine that we put in their room, down pillows can carry airborne diseases and mold.",3
LORELAI,Unbelievable   I didn't think anyone ever read those magazines.,3
MICHELorelai,"I think she had to, there was a picture of a roast chicken on the cover.",3
LORELAI,Michel.,3
MICHELorelai,She is large.,3
LORELAI,Michel.,3
MICHELorelai,And her husband in ugly.,3
LORELAI,Hey!,3
MICHELorelai,They threw pillows at me!,3
LORELAI,Independence inn.,3
EMILY,You really should identify yourself when you answer the phone at work.,3
LORELAI,"Sorry. Independence Inn, major disappointment speaking. Better?",3
EMILY,"Yes, thank you. Now I wanna talk to you about something.",3
LORELAI,sh**t.,3
EMILY,I'm in charge of the Society Matron's League's annual antique auction next Tuesday and I thought maybe you'd like to come.,3
LORELAI,Society Matron's League? That's quite a name.,3
EMILY,"And what is wrong with that name, Lorelai?",3
LORELAI,"Nothing, it just sounds so serious. Brings to mind a room full of old ladies wearing black dresses and cameos and pushing spoonfuls of cod liver oil on the kids.",3
EMILY,That's a very flattering portrait of my friends you're painting.,3
LORELAI,"I didn't mean your friends. I meant the other old ladies in the league, the ones who don't like you and your friends  cause you guys are so young.",3
EMILY,"Kindly wrap this up soon, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,Consider it wrapped.,3
EMILY,"Thank you. As I was saying, all the proceeds from the auction go to the children's hospital, and we're going to be offering some lovely pieces which I think would like very nice in that inn of yours.",3
LORELAI,What sort of pieces?,3
EMILY,"Basically a lot canes and shawls, a couple of walkers. I believe we finally talked Old Lady Rollins into giving up her teeth.",3
LORELAI,"What sort of pieces, Mom?",3
EMILY,"We have a couple of wonderful writing desks, and some French end tables, rocking chairs, picture frames, lamps, davenports.",3
LORELAI,Well ,3
EMILY,"The worst that can happen is you won't find anything you like and you've wasted a couple of hours. And who knows, you might find something you love. Plus, I will be way too busy to sit with you if that is of concern.",3
LORELAI,That is not a concern. Define  way too busy.',3
EMILY,Are you interested or not?,3
LORELAI,When is this auction?,3
EMILY,Tuesday at one o'clock.,3
LORELAI,I'll think about it.,3
EMILY,I'll see you Tuesday.,3
LORELAI,Bye.,3
MICHELorelai,"I'm sorry, did I hear you mention something about an auction?",3
LORELAI,"Uh, my mother's women's group is having one next week.",3
MICHELorelai,"Oh, well, you know   I love a good auction. The drama, the strategy.",3
LORELAI,The strategy?,3
MICHELorelai,"Oh, yes. First, you mustn't be too eager because that drives the price way up.",3
LORELAI,"Don't be too eager, got it.",3
MICHELorelai,And you must always be extremely careful of your paddle movements.,3
LORELAI,"Well, that certainly calls for a ""Dirty!""",3
MICHELorelai,"Mm, how's your arm raise? Good?",3
LORELAI,Pretty good.,3
MICHELorelai,"Ah, I have an excellent arm raise.",3
LORELAI,That's what it says on the bathroom wall.,3
MICHELorelai,"Yes, well, if you need some tips. . .",3
LORELAI,I'll give you a call.,3
MICHELorelai,Good. Take me to the auction!,3
LORELAI,Michel.,3
MICHELorelai,"Take me, I insist you take me!",3
LORELAI,You don't even know if it's gonna be any good. It's just a bunch of society women.,3
MICHELorelai,"If your mother's involved, it will be impeccable and I haven't been to an impeccable auction in over a year.",3
LORELAI,"Well, I don't know.",3
MICHELorelai,What do you want?,3
LORELAI,"Michel, I don't want anything.",3
MICHELorelai,"Stop playing coy with me. I want into that auction, you name your price.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, you have to work weekends for the rest of this month.",3
MICHELorelai,Done.,3
LORELAI,And you have to answer the phone when it rings.,3
MICHELorelai,Done.,3
LORELAI,"And you have to answer it in English, unless the person is actually foreign.",3
MICHELorelai,Done.,3
LORELAI,And you have to oversee the nature hikers next week.,3
MICHELorelai,No.,3
LORELAI,"Michel, if you wanna go to this auction, you have to be in the lobby at six o'clock Friday morning. You have to hand out towels and water bottles, you have to show them the hiking trails, and you have to let them give you a nature name.",3
MICHELorelai,"Fine, I will let them give me a nature name.",3
LORELAI,"All right, then, you can come.",3
MICHELorelai,Thank you.,3
LORELAI,Buttercup.,3
MICHELorelai,,3
RORY,I can't believe you got into a fight with Pete.,3
LORELAI,"Hey, you do not suddenly decide that garlic is an extra topping, not after five years, not after all we've been through. We single-handedly helped Pete pay for that new delivery truck of his, and I thought he needed to be reminded of that fact.",3
RORY,Very loudly.,3
LORELAI,Not that loudly.,3
RORY,Dogs started barking.,3
LORELAI,"Because they heard about the garlic incident, and no one likes getting screwed, Rory, not even a Schnauzer. Pete's a swindler. He takes advantage of single mothers and their innocent children and for that, he must pay   what?",3
RORY,He gave us free cheesy bread.,3
LORELAI,He did? Oh!,3
RORY,Yeah.,3
LORELAI,I love the cheesy bread.,3
RORY,I know you do.,3
LORELAI,"It's all hot, too.",3
RORY,Now doesn't someone feel a little silly?,3
LORELAI,Me?,3
RORY,Should we call Pete tonight?,3
LORELAI,"Okay, after cheesy bread.",3
RORY,"Fine, after the cheesy bread.",3
LORELAI,I'm gonna go get the mail   go on inside.,3
RORY,"Okay, I'm gonna go melt some mo re cheese on the pizza.",3
LORELAI,Melt away.,3
DWIGHT,"Hey! Hello there, neighbor!",3
LORELAI,"Hi. I'm sorry, are we neighbors?",3
DWIGHT,"Yes, yes we are. I just moved in across the way.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, Beenie Morrison's old place.",3
DWIGHT,"That's right, Beenie Morrison's old place.",3
LORELAI,Aw.,3
DWIGHT,Beenie Morrison's old place. I live in Beenie Morrison's old place. Isn't that great?,3
LORELAI,Only if Beenie Morrison didn't want to live there anymore.,3
DWIGHT,"Oh no, I paid him a very good price. Overpaid, actually, but it was worth it. I've been dreaming about a place like Beenie Morrison's old place for a long time, and then I found it. I'm sorry, I'm just really excited.",3
LORELAI,"That's okay, it's nice.",3
DWIGHT,It's a great neighborhood.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, it is.",3
DWIGHT,Everyone's so friendly. Babette   do you know Babette?,3
LORELAI,Everybody knows Babette.,3
DWIGHT,"Oh, she's a great lady. Oh, uh, anyhow, I'm Dwight.",3
LORELAI,"I'm Lorelai. And if you see a teen walking around with a halo and a book, that's my daughter Rory.",3
DWIGHT,"Very nice to meet you, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,"Nice to meet you too, Dwight. Welcome to the neighborhood. If there's anything I can do to help out, let me know.",3
DWIGHT,Really?,3
LORELAI,Sure.,3
DWIGHT,"Well, that's great. Actually, I have this little favor I'd love to ask.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, right now?",3
DWIGHT,"Well, this week. You know, I just got this beautiful lawn put in, really amazing shade of green, and the guy who put it in for me, he told me that I have to keep each bade of grass very moist for the first few days while the roots take, but I have to go on a business trip for a few days. Huh, last minute, and believe me, I tried to get out of it but my boss said,  Dwight, get off your keister and go make us some mo ney', so I gotta go.",3
LORELAI,"Well, sure, when the word keister's being thrown around, what are you gonna do?",3
DWIGHT,Exactly. So I was wondering if maybe you could water my lawn?,3
LORELAI,Oh.,3
DWIGHT,"Only for a few days. You know, a little in the morning, a little in the late afternoon or evening, depending on your schedule. It would be a really big favor.",3
LORELAI,"Uh, well, I guess, I could water your lawn, Dwight   sure.",3
DWIGHT,"Boy, that is something. If I would have asked somebody back where I used to live to water my lawn, I would've gotten a much more HBO kind of answer. I love it here! Uh, so, uh, can you come on over now?",3
LORELAI,Excuse me?,3
DWIGHT,So I can show you where the on/off nozzle is. It'll only take a second.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, my daughter's waiting inside for me, I  ",3
DWIGHT,"Oh, uh, well, we can do it tomorrow before I leave.",3
LORELAI,Great. What time ar e you leaving tomorrow?,3
DWIGHT,Six a.m.,3
LORELAI,Now sounds fine.,3
DWIGHT,"That's so terrific. Uh, follow me.",3
LORELAI,Okay.,3
DWIGHT,You just gotta go over here and make a right.,3
LORELAI,,3
DWIGHT,"Welcome to The Oasis! That's what I named this place, The Oasis, my oasis, a little slice of heaven right here on Earth. Gosh, I swear, I still can't believe I'm here. I was in a terrible marriage, you know.",3
LORELAI,"Actually, I didn't.",3
DWIGHT,"Oh, yeah, horrible, like a punishment out of Greek mythology. The women had five heads, suffering, agony. You know, I used to be taller?",3
LORELAI,"Really, she shrunk you?",3
DWIGHT,"I used to have more hair, too.",3
LORELAI,Uh huh.,3
DWIGHT,And higher arches.,3
LORELAI,Wow.,3
DWIGHT,"But through all the screaming and the name calling, the berating and the humiliation, somewhere in the back of my mind, I knew someday I would have it   my oasis. Oh, that's what got me through. That's what kept me from sticking my head through a plate glass window every night when I got home.",3
LORELAI,"Well, that's a really nice story, Dwight. It's very inspiring and. . .oh, hey, this looks like it does something.",3
DWIGHT,"Huh? Oh, uh, yeah, this is the on/off spigot.",3
LORELAI,Aha.,3
DWIGHT,You just turn it to the right for on.,3
LORELAI,Oh.,3
DWIGHT,And the left for off.,3
LORELAI,Seems simple.,3
DWIGHT,It's very simple.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, so, twice a day.",3
DWIGHT,"Yeah, for a good fifteen minute soaking.",3
LORELAI,I will soak my best.,3
DWIGHT,I really appreciate it.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, well, you have a good trip.",3
DWIGHT,I owe ya.,3
RORY,Where have you been?,3
LORELAI,Get in the house.,3
RORY,I thought you were gonna go get the mail.,3
LORELAI,"Go, go, go!",3
RORY,What are you doing?,3
LORELAI,"Don't look around, stare straight ahead, no more talking to people ever!",3
RORY,,3
AUCTIONEERory,"Next up, we have an occasional table from a distinguished, family-owned company in Vermont, circa 1912. We shall start the bidding at two hundred-fifty dollars. Do I hear two-fifty? Two hundred fifty, thank you.",3
LORELAI,"Wow, lots of garbage at these things.",3
MICHELorelai,"Always. You've got to be patient and wait for what you want to appear, then pounce.",3
LORELAI,"Hm, true at an auction, true at a singles bar.",3
MICHELorelai,"To put it crudely, yes.",3
LORELAI,"Crap, crap, crap that makes the previous two items not seem like crap.",3
MICHELorelai,Could you keep your crap commentaries to yourself?,3
AUCTIONEERory,"Four hundred dollars, we have four hundred, four hundred   going once, going twice, sold to bidder number sixty-five.",3
LORELAI,"Aw, wow, that was a good table.",3
MICHELorelai,"It was a good table, not a great table.",3
LORELAI,We should've gone for it.,3
MICHELorelai,Too expensive and too many scratches.,3
LORELAI,We could've buffed the scratches out.,3
MICHELorelai,"Look, if you want it that bad, it's quite obvious that the buyer's children will be selling it at his probate in the very near future.",3
LORELAI,You're awful.,3
MICHELorelai,"And he's old, now be quiet.",3
EMILY,Lorelai?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, hey Mom, you rememb er Michel?",3
EMILY,"Yes, from the inn.",3
MICHELorelai,Hello Mrs. Gilmore.,3
EMILY,Didn't you see me w aving at you before?,3
LORELAI,Yeah.,3
EMILY,You didn't wave back.,3
LORELAI,"It's dangerous to wave at an auction. You didn't see before, but when you waved you bought a motorcycle and a sidecar.",3
EMILY,I did not.,3
LORELAI,Circa 1912. Now would you drive it or would you sit in the sidecar?,3
NATALIE,"There she is, the Cobra.",3
EMILY,"Oh, now, Natalie.",3
LORELAI,The what?,3
NATALIE,This woman gets her way or she squeezes  til you comply.,3
LORELAI,Like a superhero.,3
EMILY,"Ignore her, Natalie is just being Natalie. My daughter, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,Nice to meet you.,3
NATALIE,Your mother's got such spunk. You must love her.,3
LORELAI,I think she'd squeeze me to death if I didn't.,3
EMILY,"Natalie, you're embarrassing me.",3
NATALIE,"Oh, hush, Emily. Listen to this. . . our auctioneer calls in sick this morning, they are such flakes, and what is an auction without an auctioneer?",3
LORELAI,Just a bunch of nuts with paddles surrounded by mismatched furniture?,3
NATALIE,Exactly. But your mother got on the horn with that lazy Charlie and she squeezed and squeezed  til   voila   he suddenly felt better. The Cobra.,3
LORELAI,The Cobra.,3
EMILY,"Oh, now, stop it.",3
NATALIE,"You're humble, don't be. Nice to meet you.",3
LORELAI,Same here.,3
NATALIE,"Edna's group wants to give you kudos, too, Emily. Make sure to swing by.",3
EMILY,I will.,3
EMILY,I should make the rounds. Say goodbye before you leave.,3
LORELAI,"Hm, I will, Cobra.",3
EMILY,Stop it.,3
LORELAI,"It goes with the motorcycle thing, too.",3
AUCTIONEERory,"Do I have two hundred-fifty? Two hundred-fifty, thank you. Do I have three hundred? Three hundred, thank you very much.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, is this our end tables?",3
MICHELorelai,Shh!,3
AUCTIONEERory,"Moving on to three-fifty? Three-fifty, do we have four?",3
LORELAI,Let me do the paddle.,3
MICHELorelai,No.,3
LORELAI,"I just wanna hold it, it's still your thing.",3
MICHELorelai,I'm losing my concentration.,3
LORELAI,Fine. I'm gonna go get a drink.,3
MICHELorelai,Please.,3
AUCTIONEERory,Do we have five hundred?,3
PEYTON,"Can I get a Merlot, please?",3
BARTENDERory,Yes sir.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, that sounds great, make it two.",3
BARTENDERory,"Got just enough for one and this is the last of the red, sorry.",3
LORELAI,Aw. I'll give you two bucks for it.,3
BARTENDERory,They're free.,3
LORELAI,"Which makes two bucks a great offer, and this is an auction, right?",3
BARTENDERory,Yes.,3
PEYTON,Three.,3
BARTENDERory,What?,3
PEYTON,I'll give you three for it.,3
LORELAI,Four.,3
PEYTON,Five.,3
LORELAI,Six.,3
PEYTON,Six-fifty,3
LORELAI,"Ooh, losing steam.",3
PEYTON,Just weighing cost versus benefit.,3
LORELAI,"Well, you've gotta think about these things.",3
PEYTON,How about this? Can I get an empty glass?,3
BARTENDERory,"Yes, sir.",3
LORELAI,Aw. You're the Solomon of wine.,3
PEYTON,Everybody's gotta be something. I got a few things coming up that I'm bidding on.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, oh. Great, the bartender and I are the only ones in the building that don't get to hold a paddle.",3
PEYTON,Why don't you put a bid on one of the paddles?,3
LORELAI,What would I use to bid on it?,3
PEYTON,"I'm Solomon, not Einstein.",3
LORELAI,Bye Solomon.,3
BARTENDERory,"Oops, I had a spare bottle all the time.",3
LORELAI,,3
LORELAI,"Hi, yes, I was at your auction yesterday and I was wondering if you could help me. Um, I met a man there and I would like to contact him but I didn't get his name and I wondered if you could look it up for me. He was paddle number seventeen, and. . .Oh right, confidential, got it. . .Well, you know, actually, I misspoke earlier because this isn't a complete stranger I'm trying to contact here, he's an old friend from school. . . Good question. Well, I don't know his name because I only knew him by his nickname. . .Uh, Shamu. We called him Shamu. He was kind of, um, a big guy in high school, but he's slimmed down quite a bit. . .No, see, I don't have time to contact the high school alumni commit tee because time is of the essence. . . See, Shamu and I went to a liquor store after the auction and we bought a lottery ticket together and we tore it and I took half and he took half, and I'll be damned if the thing didn't win! . . .Fourteen million dollars! . . .Really, but see, we have to claim it by four p.m. today or we forfeit. . .Ah, yes. . .Oh, well, but there's one more thing that I forgot to tell you. See, um, my blood type is o-negative and he's o-negative and I have a medical condition that. . .All right, then. Well, thank you anyway. Bye.",3
RORY,So. . .,3
LORELAI,Yes?,3
RORY,You ran into your old friend Shamu?,3
LORELAI,Mmhmm.,3
RORY,And you won millions of dollars?,3
LORELAI,Yup.,3
RORY,And you need a transfusion?,3
LORELAI,"I'm just trying to get the name of a really cool guy I met at this auction, but they won't give it to me.",3
RORY,"Wow, that's a lot of effort. Must've been cute.",3
LORELAI,And witty   you don't meet that everyday.,3
RORY,You know who would have his name?,3
LORELAI,Who?,3
RORY,Grandma.,3
LORELAI,"Ah, no, she only knows the Bitty's, she doesn't know the young ones.",3
RORY,She knows everyone at these kinds of things. You know Grandma.,3
LORELAI,I cannot ask her for this.,3
RORY,Then kiss Shamu goodbye.,3
LORELAI,But maybe you could ask her.,3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,"Come on, ask her, do me a f avor!",3
RORY,You want me to ask Grandma for the name of a man that I didn't meet at a function that I didn't attend?,3
LORELAI,I'll share my lottery winnings with you.,3
RORY,It's ridiculously transparent.,3
LORELAI,Fourteen million dollars.,3
RORY,"But you're sharing half with him and taxes will take a huge chunk, and oh yeah   you didn't win the lottery. Ask her yourself.",3
LORELAI,You're mean.,3
RORY,,3
EMILY,What do you think of the pork? Rory?,3
RORY,It's good.,3
EMILY,I'm not sure. Richard?,3
RICHARD,It's fine.,3
EMILY,I'm not sure.,3
LORELAI,"It's really good, Mom.",3
EMILY,"Yes, well, I'm not sure.",3
RICHARD,"Pork is bred leaner these days. It has a different taste. Less fat equals less flavor. Yet another example of the great advances man has made, flavorless pork. Hurrah for the opposable thumbs.",3
EMILY,"All right, enough talk about pork. Please, someone change the subject.",3
RORY,Mom had a really good time at the auction the other day.,3
EMILY,Did you?,3
LORELAI,"Yes, yes, I did.",3
EMILY,"Well, I'm glad. Did you see anything you liked?",3
RORY,"Yeah, Mom, anything look good to you there?",3
LORELAI,"Yes, actually, I, uh, bought a couple of end tables for the inn.",3
EMILY,I must say I was very impressed with the selection this year. I even wound up purchasing a couple of pieces for myself.,3
RICHARD,"Yes, how nice to have yet another chair you can't sit in.",3
EMILY,It's one hundred years old.,3
RICHARD,Wonderful. We can put it next to the two-hundred-year-old footstool you can't put your foot on.,3
EMILY,"Oh, Richard, please.",3
RICHARD,"I'm only teasing, Emily. It is one of the great pleasures of my life to be able to surround you with a house full of useless objects. No, I'm never happier than when we're standing in the corner staring at our furniture.",3
EMILY,"Eat your pork, please.",3
RORY,"You know, I believe there was something at the auction that Mom wanted but she didn't get. Isn't that right, Mom?",3
EMILY,Oh really? What was that?,3
LORELAI,"I think it was a steamer trunk for Rory to take with her to military school, wasn't it, honey?",3
EMILY,"I don't rememb er a steamer trunk, but I can check on it for you if you like.",3
LORELAI,"That's not necessary, Mom. Uh, so, Mom, it was a very nice bunch of people you had at that auction.",3
EMILY,"Yes, very nice.",3
LORELAI,"I was surprised at how many young people were there. I mean, you know, younger people. Um, in fact, uh, like, for instance, this guy that I talked to for quite awhile, he was. . .younger.",3
EMILY,What man was that?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, I didn't get his name, but he was a nice looking guy. He had a gray suit and he was paddle number seventeen. He likes Merlot.",3
EMILY,Are you talking about Peyton Sanders?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, I don't know, maybe.",3
EMILY,"Wait one second, I'll look it up.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, no no no, Mom, you don't have to . . .she's looking it up.",3
EMILY,"Paddle number seventeen, Peyton Sanders.",3
LORELAI,"Oh great, oh, Peyton Sanders. Well, that's great that it's Peyton Sanders. . .  cause that's, uh, great. How well do you know this Peyton Sanders?",3
EMILY,Why?,3
LORELAI,What?,3
EMILY,Why do you wanna know how well I know Peyton Sanders?,3
LORELAI,"I don't wanna know. I was just mentioning that he was, you know, seemed. . .uh, you know. . .",3
EMILY,Young.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, young. Okay, Mom, uh, Peyton and I kind of hit it off and I wondered if you possibly had his number. . .okay, there, I said it. Pass the flavorless pork.",3
EMILY,You're asking me for his number?,3
LORELAI,"If it's not a big deal, then yes.",3
EMILY,"Well, well, well. Richard, Lorelai's asking me for a man's number.",3
RICHARD,So I heard.,3
LORELAI,"But if it's a big deal, forget it.",3
EMILY,It's not a big deal at all. I don't have his number.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, then, never mind.",3
EMILY,I can get his number. Would you like me to get his number?,3
LORELAI,"Um, it's up to you.",3
EMILY,"It can't be up to me. I didn't ask for his number, you asked for his number, therefore it has to be up to you as to whether or not I get his number.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, Mom.",3
EMILY,Would you like me to get his number?,3
LORELAI,"Yes, if you don't mind.",3
EMILY,I don't mind at all.,3
LORELAI,Thank you.,3
EMILY,You're welcome.,3
LORELAI,,3
LORELAI,"Okay, the clock is right! If we hurry, we still have time to hit Luke's for breakfast. What'd I forget?",3
RORY,Pants.,3
LORELAI,"Uh! Ooh, don't do that. Come on, let's go!",3
RORY,I can't.,3
LORELAI,You can't have breakfast? You have to have breakfast.,3
RORY,"The clock is wrong, I'll miss my bus.",3
LORELAI,"Forget your bus, I'll drive you to school.",3
RORY,You will?,3
LORELAI,Yes. Oh sh**t!,3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,Dwight's lawn.,3
RORY,"Aw, there goes the breakfast sandwich.",3
LORELAI,"No, no, let's hurry, we can still do Luke's.",3
RORY,Mom!,3
LORELAI,Let's go!,3
RORY,"Agh, my shoes!",3
LORELAI,"You don't need shoes! In my day, we walked twenty miles in the snow just to get to our shoes!",3
RORY,,3
LORELAI,"Okay, come on, sprinkle. There, drink up boys, we've got a breakfast to get to.",3
RORY,Mom.,3
LORELAI,What?,3
RORY,I think this is for you.,3
LORELAI,"Lorelai? No, it must be someone else. Hey, don't read that. Do not read that. I'm tellingyou, no good can come from you reading that.",3
RORY, Dear Lorelai. . .',3
LORELAI,And she's reading it.,3
RORY, Just a couple of things that came to mind after we talked.',3
LORELAI,Oh great.,3
RORY," First of all, thank you for this very kind favor you're doing me. I still can't believe that any one person would be so kind to someone they just met.'",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, apparently Dwight's last home was Oz, and not as in  The Wizard Of.'",3
RORY," Second, since you are already coming over to take care of my lawn, I was hoping you wouldn't mind stopping inside and watering my African violets. I have written the directions on a separate piece of paper, there's a key in the planter by the door. Please go in, make yourself at home. I have food in the fridge, satellite TV, and a great collection of board games. My oasis is your oasis.'",3
LORELAI,"I'm not going in that house. Rory, do not pick up that key.",3
RORY,But we have to water the violets.,3
LORELAI,"No, I didn't agree to violets. He threw the violets in after he'd already rooked me into watering his lawn.",3
RORY,Don't you at least wanna see what his house looks like?,3
LORELAI,"Absolutely not. Key, please. Let me just say, if we walk in there and his dead mother is sitting in a rocking chair, not a bit surprised.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, Dwight.",3
RORY,This place is great.,3
LORELAI,Someone took the whole lounge craze very seriously.,3
RORY,Oh my.,3
LORELAI,"Oh geez, he wasn't kidding.",3
RORY,I have never seen this many board games. He's got Monopoly from every country in the world.,3
LORELAI,"Hey, when you finally meet him?",3
RORY,Yeah?,3
LORELAI,Rememb er he owns Twister   there's a great visual awaiting you.,3
RORY,"Got it. Hey, how come w e don't have a tiki bar?",3
LORELAI,"Well, we are not two wild and crazy guys.",3
RORY,You like pina coladas.,3
LORELAI,And getting lost in the rain.,3
RORY,I love it here.,3
LORELAI,"It's quite a statement, I'll give him that.",3
RORY,"Hey, African violets.",3
LORELAI,"Oh yeah, right. Just a sec. Hello?. . .Hi Peyton, thanks for calling me back. . .Well, I hope it was a good surprise. It was a good surprise.",3
RORY,Yay.,3
LORELAI,"You just flew back on your jet, huh? . . .From Maui? Sounds great. . . Yes, I would love to get together with you. . .Um, I'm pretty flexible next week. What'd you have in mind? . . . David Bowie?",3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,"I love David Bowie, I would love to go. . . Oh, well, yeah, it is a ways away, but. . .No, I think that sounds just crazy enough.",3
RORY,What sounds crazy enough?,3
LORELAI,"Well, that sounds great, Peyton. It's a plan. . . I'll see you then, okay, bye. We're having dinner tomorrow.",3
RORY,What were you saying about David Bowie?,3
LORELAI,"Well, first, he asked me to the David Bowie concert next week.",3
RORY,You're so lucky!,3
LORELAI,"I know! And once that was set, he said that a week was an awfully long time to wait.",3
RORY,He did not.,3
LORELAI,So we're having dinner tomorrow.,3
RORY,And Bowie next week.,3
LORELAI,And Bowie next week.,3
RORY,Two dates in one phone call. Talk about not wasting any time.,3
LORELAI,"He sounds very cool, and not just  cause he owns his own jet.",3
RORY,"Well, rememb er to tell him that the way to get to you is through your daughter, who desperately wants to go to Amsterdam.",3
LORELAI,I will rememb er.,3
RORY,I think this place is lucky.,3
LORELAI,,3
LORELAI,The red skirt is not working.,3
RORY,Try the blue.,3
LORELAI,"Blue let me down ten minutes ago, I think it's conspiring with the red.",3
RORY,I wish you'd just wear the dress we picked out this morning.,3
LORELAI,"No, you know as well as I do, the morning butt and evening butt are two completely different butts.",3
RORY,"Well, whatever butt you've got tonight had better hurry because he's gonna be here any minute.",3
LORELAI,"Rats. Fine, okay, striped skirt, burgundy sweater, that's it. What do you think? And rememb er, I'm wearing this no matter what because I cannot spend one more second deciding what to wear, so the answer has to be,  You look fantastic.'",3
RORY,You look fantastic.,3
LORELAI,Pink and black.,3
RORY,With a flippy skirt.,3
LORELAI,Grab a necklace?,3
LORELAI,"Um, okay, here is my concern.",3
RORY,Voice it.,3
LORELAI,"Well, you know, I only saw this guy once for like ten minutes and the lighting was only so- so and I hadn't eaten anything, and, like, what if I'm remembering him a lot cuter than he was?",3
RORY,I'm sure you're not.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, but what if I am? You know how these things are. You get bored, you need a diversion, so you superimpose a really cute guy's face over a really scary looking guy.",3
RORY,"Well, then you'll just have to strike up a conversation with him and find out what kind of a man he is beneath the surface.",3
LORELAI,What? On the first date   what will he think of me?,3
RORY,Just order an extra dessert.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, fine. Well?",3
RORY,I like the brown.,3
LORELAI,"Come here a sec, you've got some dirt on your forehead. I'm sorry, it's just the sign of the devil, my mistake.",3
RORY,You look beautiful.,3
LORELAI,"Thank you. I think that's him. Well, the car sure is pretty.",3
RORY,Come on.,3
LORELAI,"Okay now, if for some reason, he does turn out to have like a horn in the middle of his forehead, you will call me in one hour with a very high fever.",3
RORY,Deal.,3
LORELAI,"God, I'm nervous. Why am I nervous?",3
RORY,Because you're crazy.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, good, thank you.",3
PEYTON,Hi.,3
LORELAI,You're feeling just fine. Hey Peyton.,3
PEYTON,Am I early?,3
LORELAI,"No, you're right on time. Peyton, I want you to meet my daughter, Rory.",3
PEYTON,"It's a pleasure, Rory.",3
RORY,Hi.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, so, don't wait up and remember only two or three crackheads at the most, they eat all the good cereal.",3
RORY,Deal. Have fun.,3
PEYTON,"It was nice meet ing you, Rory. You look wonderful.",3
LORELAI,,3
LORELAI,You up?,3
RORY,What time is it?,3
LORELAI,10:15.,3
RORY,Oops.,3
LORELAI,Yup.,3
RORY,What happened? He was hornless.,3
LORELAI,"No, he had no horns, he also had no personality.",3
RORY,Yikes.,3
LORELAI,And no sense of humor.,3
RORY,Gross.,3
LORELAI,And no idea how boring he was.,3
RORY,I'm sorry.,3
LORELAI,"That's okay. The evening started well enough   that is, until we got to the car. . .a Jaguar XJ8 convertible with a 290 horsepower engine, in case you were wondering. You weren't? Funny, neither was I. However, he told me an yhow. He told me a lot of other things about the car, also. Like, did you know how many inches the pistons are? I do! I also know the correct oil to use for it, how to treat the leather interior, and how to load it onto a flatbed truck in case of a flat tire.",3
RORY,"Geez, did he talk about anything else but the car?",3
LORELAI,Not until we got to the restaurant . . .and the wine list.,3
RORY,"Oh no, he's a wine-y?",3
LORELAI,"Yes, he sniffed, swirled, swished, and did every other pretentious and borderline- disgusting thing that you can do with a glass of wine in a public place, and he did it all while describing to me the vintage discrepancies and the wood they use for the barrels in Palermo and the grape crop projections for the following year. And I, in turn, chimed in with my story about getting sick on Andre Cold Duck in the back of Peter Cutler's car in ninth grade. He didn't find that quite as charming.",3
RORY,I can't believe that. That is one of your best anecdotes.,3
LORELAI,I know! So I stopped talking. He continued talking and I just sat there thinking about Peter Cutler. How was Peter Cutler? Where was Peter Cutler? Was there any chance that Peter Cutler would appear and k*ll the man sitting across from me talking about torque?,3
RORY,Was the food good at least?,3
LORELAI,"Tiny portions, weird sauces.",3
RORY,I'm sorry.,3
LORELAI,"That's okay. You don't know until you try, right? Anyhow, I am going to go to bed now anddream of Peter Cutler. Hopefully, it will be dirty.",3
RORY,What about Bowie?,3
LORELAI,Unh uh! I'm not sharing Peter Cutler with Bowie.,3
RORY,Are you still going?,3
LORELAI,No. There's no way I could stand this guy for another night. I'll catch Bowie the next time he does a farewell tour.,3
RORY,Bummer .,3
LORELAI,I know.,3
RORY,Night Mom.,3
LORELAI,"Night babe. Oh, and hey, tomorrow, I'll fill you in on how many hours you have to clock to get your pilot's license.",3
RORY,,3
LORELAI,"Well, the quilting convention is sitting down to tea.",3
MICHELorelai,"Uh, I'm doing internal cartwheels.",3
LORELAI,Any messages?,3
MICHELorelai,Your mother called. The auction people dropped the lamp that we bought at her place and dropped hers off here and she's desperate to have it for some soiree at her house this evening.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, swell. Well, I guess I can take it to her when I do my other errands. I can pick up Rory, too. This is cool.",3
MICHELorelai,"Yes, it was a personal purchase.",3
LORELAI,"I want it, what is it?",3
MICHELorelai,An eighteenth century bleeding bowl.,3
LORELAI,A bleeding bowl?,3
MICHELorelai,"When doctors bled patients, the blood had to go somewhere, no?",3
LORELAI,,3
LORELAI,"Hey Mom, I think this is yours.",3
EMILY,"Ah! Yes, it is. And I believe this is yours.",3
LORELAI,"Yes, it is.",3
EMILY,That auction house is usually so good with deliveries. I'm surprised at the mix up.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, well, Gilmore and Gilmore   there's kind of a connection there.",3
EMILY,"Yes, I suppose there is.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, well, I have to pick up Rory in a little while, so we'll see you Friday.",3
EMILY,"Would you like to sit down, maybe have some coffee?",3
LORELAI,"Oh, I don't wanna leave her standing there.",3
EMILY,"Well, Rory doesn't get out for another half an hour. You've got a little time.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, I guess I can stay a minute.",3
EMILY,Wonderful. I'll get you a stopwatch so you can keep exact time.,3
LORELAI,"Uh, that won't be necessary, Mom.",3
EMILY,"So, how is everything?",3
LORELAI,Everything's fine.,3
EMILY,And how's everything with Rory?,3
LORELAI,Everything with Rory's fine.,3
EMILY,And how's everything at the inn?,3
LORELAI,Everything at the inn is fine.,3
EMILY,And how was your date?,3
LORELAI,My what?,3
EMILY,Your date with Peyton.,3
LORELAI,"Well, my date was, shockingly enough, fine. How did you know about his date?",3
EMILY,His mother told me.,3
LORELAI,You know his mother?,3
EMILY,A little.,3
LORELAI,Oh good.,3
EMILY,"So, tell me, what did you do?",3
LORELAI,When?,3
EMILY,On your date.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, well, we just went to dinner, that's all.",3
EMILY,I heard you went driving around afterward.,3
LORELAI,"Well, sure, uh, you know, we drove in the direction of my house. I guess you could call that driving around.",3
EMILY,I heard Peyton had a lovely time.,3
LORELAI,"Did he? Well, that's nice, I'm glad. I should really get going, Mom.",3
EMILY,"Oh, you have a little more time. I wanna hear more about your date.",3
LORELAI,"Well, it was just a date, you know, nothing special. Two people eating and talking   one person talking slightly more than the other.",3
EMILY,Had he called you since?,3
LORELAI,"No, but  ",3
EMILY,"Oh, well, it was only last night, there's time. I just think this is so exciting.",3
LORELAI,"You know what, Mom, I wouldn't get too excited if I were you.",3
EMILY,Why not?,3
LORELAI,"Well, because we didn't really hit it off that well.",3
EMILY,What?,3
LORELAI,"No one's fault, he's just not really my type.",3
EMILY,What do you mean he's not your type?,3
LORELAI,"Well, we just don't have any of the same interests, and we didn't find a whole lot to talk about. You know, basically the date was kind of a dud.",3
EMILY,"Oh, well, that's too bad.",3
LORELAI,Yeah.,3
EMILY,"Well, you'll just have to try a little harder on the next date.",3
LORELAI,Excuse me?,3
EMILY,Aren't you going to a concert together next week?,3
LORELAI,"Ah, that Peyton's a real Mama's boy, isn't he?",3
EMILY,"Just because he shares his life with his mother doesn't make him a Mama's boy, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,"I'm not gonna go to the concert with him, Mom.",3
EMILY,But I thought you had a plan.,3
LORELAI,"We did, but that was before we spent any time together and realized we can't spend any time together.",3
EMILY,You're not gonna cancel on him.,3
LORELAI,"Mom, believe me, he won't be surprised. He didn't have that great a time either.",3
EMILY,"Lorelai, you have to go to the concert. You made a commitment to someone, you have to honor it.",3
LORELAI,"Mom, this is my business, okay?",3
EMILY,"Ugh, this is so like you.",3
LORELAI,What is so like me?,3
EMILY,"You spend five seconds with a person and if they say one wrong thing, you turn on them and never give them a second chance.",3
LORELAI,What?,3
EMILY,"You are extremely judgmental, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,"I'm not extremely judgmental of the pot calling the kettle black. I spent two and a half hours with a man who talked about nothing but himself, his place, his car. . .",3
EMILY,He's proud of his accomplishments. What's wrong with that?,3
LORELAI,"He didn't end world hunger, Mom. He simply made the grueling decision to spring for the bigger tires.",3
EMILY,Lorelai.,3
LORELAI,"Mom, you know what, I have to go.",3
EMILY,We're not finished discussing this.,3
LORELAI,,3
LORELAI,"Ooh, I got you a present.",3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,In my purse.,3
RORY,Cardio Salsa.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, they play the Miami Sound Machine and you dance around, you get a really great workout.",3
RORY,Why would you buy me this?,3
LORELAI,Because I'll feel stupid doing in alone.,3
RORY,Too bad.,3
LORELAI,Come on.,3
RORY,No way.,3
LORELAI,Salsa with me. Pretend I'm Antonio Banderas.,3
RORY,"If you were standing in back of Antonio Banderas, I couldn't pretend that you were Antonio Banderas.",3
LORELAI,Don't you want your mother to live a long and healthy life?,3
RORY,Not if I have to do Cardio Salsa.,3
LORELAI,What?,3
RORY,"Nice knowing you, senora. Adios.",3
LORELAI,I would salsa for you.,3
RORY,"Well, luckily, you'll never have to.",3
LORELAI,"Hello. . .oh, Dwight, hi, it's nice to hear from you, too. . .yeah, hey, how did you get my cell phone number? . . . oh, yeah, gotta love that Babette, huh? . . . oh, the lawn's fine. . .okay. . .okay. . .sure, Dwight, you have a safe trip. . .yeah, bye. It seems that Dwight has been checking the weather reports and Stars Hollow is going to be extra sunny for the next few days, so he was wondering if instead of watering the lawn twice a day for fifteen minutes, we could water it three times a day for ten minutes.",3
RORY,He should really get a dog.,3
LORELAI,Only if that dog doesn't mind using the bathroom at the gas station  cause that lawn is definitely off limits.,3
RORY,True.,3
LORELAI,"So, I have to get back to the inn. . .could you, um, water for me?",3
RORY,It was your idea to do it.,3
LORELAI,"I can't, I have a China shipment coming in.",3
RORY,Do it tonight.,3
LORELAI,"Dwight says it needs it now, and if we let that lawn die, he's gonna vibe us for the rest of our lives.",3
RORY,"Not me, I'm going off to college next year.",3
LORELAI,You'll be home for holidays.,3
RORY,Maybe not now.,3
LORELAI,You would stay away from me on holidays just because of Dwight?,3
RORY,"Hey, nobody wants vibing on the holidays.",3
LORELAI,"Rory, please? I'm gonna be seriously late if I have to go all the way home.",3
RORY,Fine.,3
LORELAI,Thank you. You're my favorite daughter.,3
RORY,You say that to all your daughters.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, I do, but I only mean it with you.",3
RORY,Bye.,3
LORELAI,Bye.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, Dwight, please, you are on a business trip   get a hooker. Hello?",3
RICHARD,"Lorelai, good, I'm glad I got you. I just wanted you to know that I am playing golf with Peyton's father Brennan on Sunday.",3
LORELAI,Okay. Wear sunscreen.,3
RICHARD,I will call you afterward and we can evaluate how to proceed from there.,3
LORELAI,What are you talking about?,3
RICHARD,"Well, I'm not sure how much damage has been done so I need some time with the man to assess whether or not a simple apology will work.",3
LORELAI,Apology from who?,3
RICHARD,From you.,3
LORELAI,For what?,3
RICHARD,For the way you treated Peyton.,3
LORELAI,Are you serious?,3
RICHARD,Of course I'm serious.,3
LORELAI,"Dad, this is none of your business.",3
RICHARD,It certainly is my business.,3
LORELAI,"No, who I date or do not date is absolutely none of your business.",3
RICHARD,Peyton's mother is in the DAR with your mother.,3
LORELAI,I know that.,3
RICHARD,"She's also on the Opera Committee with your mother, the hospital board with your mother, the horticultural society with your mother.",3
LORELAI,"I get it, they hang, what's the point?",3
RICHARD,"This woman is a very important person in our social circle. She may have taken what you did the wrong way, which could affect her relationship with your mother.",3
LORELAI,"Dad, all I did was not go on a second date with her fully grown son. There's no way she's gonna be mad at Mom for that.",3
RICHARD,"Lorelai, you obviously do not understand the way things work in your mother's world. There is a certain protocol that must be followed, social rules that dictate proper behavior, and these rules must be very strictly adhered to.",3
LORELAI,"Dad, I'm not going out with Peyton again, period.",3
RICHARD,"Lorelai, let me tell you a little story. Now, two years ago, Sally Wallington's check for the winter formal bounced.",3
LORELAI,So?,3
RICHARD,It took her two weeks to replace the check.,3
LORELAI,So?,3
RICHARD,"When Sally attended the next DAR meeting, she was served the last cup of tea.",3
LORELAI,Soooo?,3
RICHARD,"Before this unfortunate incident, Sally Wallington always received the first cup of tea. When she was suddenly demoted, your mother moved up to the prime tea spot, and she's held that spot ever since. Now, she's very proud of that spot, and now she's afraid that this little incident may jeopardize it.",3
LORELAI,"Dad, I explained this to Mom and I'll explain it to you. I'm not sixteen, I don't live with you anymore, I've been making my own decisions, romantic and otherwise, for a long time now and you can play all the golf you want but the subject better be letting chicks into the Augusta Golf Club because my love life is officially off limits.",3
RICHARD,Didn't you hear what I just said?,3
LORELAI,"About the tea? Yes, I heard it, and I'm sorry, but it sounds insane.",3
RICHARD,"Of course it sounds insane! It is insane, that is not the point.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, then what's the point?",3
RICHARD,,3
DWIGHT,"Hey, it's Dwight, leave a message, I'm listening.",3
WOMAN,"Dwight, hi it's Doris. Doris, your wife, remember me? The woman who was asleep in bed when you snuck out the window like a spineless little worm! How dare you sneak out like that, you sniveling little pond scum sample! I should call Erin Brockovich to bring a lawsuit against your parents, you steaming lump of toxic waste! You really thought you could get away from me? From me? I would've found you sooner if I had bothered to look, but now I have, I found you, and all I can say is this   I want my board games back! I want them back and I want them back now! And I will hunt you down to the ends of the Earth until I get them back   especially the Trivial Pursuit!",3
RORY,,3
JESS,"Whoa, whoa, slow down.",3
RORY,Get out of my way.,3
JESS,I like the new look. It's very Blue Crush.,3
RORY,Hilarious.,3
JESS,What's the matter?,3
RORY,Nothing.,3
JESS,You're walking pretty fast for nothing.,3
RORY,"Well, our president said exercise and I am very patriotic.",3
JESS,And completely soaked.,3
RORY,Where is everyone?,3
JESS,Who are you looking for?,3
RORY,No one.,3
JESS,"Rory, stop. What's the matter   other than the fact that you're obviously out of towels.",3
RORY,,3
RORY,"You don't have to do this. I didn't ask you to do this. I can just find someone else to do it. Aw, you made it look so easy.",3
JESS,"Yeah, it was loose. You just had to press down and give it a good twist, that's all.",3
RORY,"Well, thank you.",3
JESS,You're welcome. So things are good?,3
RORY,"Oh, yeah, really good.",3
JESS,School?,3
RORY,Good.,3
JESS,Still gonna do the Harvard thing?,3
RORY,Yeah.,3
JESS,Good.,3
RORY,"Yeah, good. So. . . My pager.",3
JESS,"Yeah, I figured.",3
JESS,Who is it?,3
RORY,"It's, uh, Dean. I paged him ear lier to come over and help me and he just got the message, so he's. . .",3
JESS,Coming over to help.,3
RORY,Yeah.,3
JESS,,3
LORELAI,Hi Mom.,3
EMILY,Hello Lorelai.,3
RORY,Hi Grandma.,3
EMILY,Hello Rory. That's a pretty sweater.,3
RORY,Thank you.,3
EMILY,"I do love you in blue, you should wear blue more often. Buy her more blue, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, I'll get right on it. So, I brought you something Mom.",3
EMILY,"Oh really? Soda, Rory?",3
RORY,"Yes, please.",3
LORELAI,"Um, these are some pictures from Sookie's wedding. There's a great one of you and Dad dancing. I put them in an album for you.",3
EMILY,"Well, that's very nice, thank you.",3
LORELAI,You wanna see?,3
EMILY,"I'm mak ing drinks right now, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,"Right, later it is.",3
EMILY,Here you go. Here.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, guess I'm having wine.",3
EMILY,You didn't want wine?,3
LORELAI,Wine's fine.,3
EMILY,"Give it back, I'll get you something else.",3
LORELAI,"No, I'm good with wine, Mom.",3
EMILY,"I can make you a martini, would you like a martini?",3
LORELAI,"No, I just   you usually ask me what I want, and tonight you didn't ask me what I wanted so I didn't have a chance to tell you how much I would love some wine.",3
EMILY,I bought some cheese to have before dinner.,3
RORY,"Great, we love cheese.",3
LORELAI,It goes great with wine.,3
EMILY,I will be right back.,3
LORELAI,"Boy, it's cold in here.",3
RORY,It's a lot colder where you're sitting.,3
LORELAI,Ugh. She's mad at me.,3
RORY,Yup.,3
LORELAI,Think she's gonna be mad at me all night?,3
RORY,Yup.,3
LORELAI,I guess I should go in there and talk to her.,3
RORY,Yup.,3
LORELAI,You wouldn't wanna go in there and talk to her for me?,3
RORY,Nope.,3
LORELAI,Good thing you don't get paid by the word.,3
RORY,"The sooner you get in there, the sooner you get cheese.",3
LORELAI,,3
LORELAI,Need some help?,3
EMILY,"No, I'm fine, thank you.",3
LORELAI,"Mom, I just wanted to say I'm sorry.",3
EMILY,Sorry for what?,3
LORELAI,"Sorry about the whole Peyton thing. When I asked you for his number, I didn't think. . .",3
EMILY,Think about what?,3
LORELAI,"Think about what would happen if things didn't work out with us. I mean, I know his mom is your friend, and I shouldn't have even gotten mixed up in this whole thing if I wasn't prepared to rememb er that what I do will affect you, and to me it's just a Bowie concert, but to you, it's not. I was a little thoughtless and I'm sorry, but you have to understand that I was not lying when I said we had a bad time. We had a really, really, really, really, really bad time. I swear, it was one of the worst times I've ever had, it was awful. Do you remember skiing with the Danners and their Dobermans?",3
EMILY,"Oh, God, yes.",3
LORELAI,,3
EMILY,"Well, your saying that means a lot.",3
LORELAI,Hm.,3
EMILY,"Thank you, Lorelai. Borrow Rory's sweater when you go.",3

RORY,Morning.,3
LORELAI,Morning.,3
RORY,"Wow, someone woke up in project mode today.",3
LORELAI,"I'm like the army, baby. I get more done before nine o'clock in the morning than others get done all day.",3
RORY,"Well, as long as you don't abandon it mid-project.",3
LORELAI,I do not do that.,3
RORY,Make your own seashell candles.,3
LORELAI,"Aw, not fair.",3
RORY,The place smelled like melted crayons for three weeks.,3
LORELAI,This is different.,3
RORY,"Fine, what's the project?",3
LORELAI,This is a pile of every catalog we have received for the last three months.,3
RORY,Okay.,3
LORELAI,"I have gathered them all together, and I will now proceed to call all the companies that are sending us duplicates and tell them to stop.",3
RORY,That's very environmental of you.,3
LORELAI,"It's getting ridiculous. We get, like, eight of some of these.",3
Posted,11/17/02 16:34,3
RORY,You're kidding.,3
LORELAI,"Check this out. This is a stack of identical catalogs mailed to Lorelai Gilmore, Rory Gilmore, Lorelai Rory Gilmore, Lorelai V. Gilmore, Lorelai Victoria Gilmore, Lorelai Gilmo, Lorelai Gil, and Squeegy Beckinheim.",3
RORY,How'd that get in there?,3
LORELAI,"I once told a store my name w as Squeegy Beckinheim just to see how many catalogs they would sell my name to, and apparently my name is to catalog companies what Brooke Shields' picture is to Chinese restaurants.",3
RORY,How many?,3
LORELAI,Ten.,3
RORY,Wow.,3
LORELAI,Including one we were already getting seven catalogs from.,3
RORY,So apparently you made the problem worse.,3
LORELAI,Unintentionally.,3
RORY,This one is addressed to Tookie Clothespin.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, I forgot my code name at the second store I tested, so I told them it was Tookie Clothespin.",3
RORY,Which means we get even more catalogs.,3
LORELAI,"Again, it was unintentional.",3
RORY,"When you start a forest fire unintentionally, it's still your fault.",3
LORELAI,You're putting calling myself Squeegy Beckinheim and Tookie Clothespin on a level with starting a forest fire?,3
RORY,It's k*lling trees.,3
LORELAI,You're depressing me now.,3
RORY,"Well, get on the phone and stop the madness. That'll cheer you up.",3
LORELAI,I need coffee.,3
RORY,There's more coffee.,3
LORELAI,"I should get ready, too.",3
RORY,You're stopping mid-project.,3
LORELAI,I'm bored.,3
RORY,Then don't start these projects.,3
LORELAI,I promise I'll finish. I just wanna check on the seashells.,3
RORY,These catalogs will be sitting here forever.,3
LORELAI,"No, they won't. They're biodegradable.",3
RORY,"Come on, I'll call half, you call half, okay?",3
LORELAI,Okay.,3
RORY,Okay.,3
LORELAI,"You do yours first, then I'll do mine.",3
RORY,Hey!,3
LORELAI,We only have one phone. You're young. You'll dial faster.,3
RORY,,3
TAYLORory,The bottom line is that too many birds are landing atop the street lights and relieving themselves on helpless passersby. And I dare say that some of these birds seem to be doing it on purpose.,3
BABETTE,"You get dumped on, Taylor?",3
TAYLORory,It's not just me. . .,3
LUKE,"Hey, if anybody has a picture of Taylor getting dumped on, I'll pay top dollar.",3
KIRK,,3
PATTY,"Taylor, all animals have to. . .you know. How are you gonna stop birds from doing that?",3
TAYLORory,"Easy. Put sharp metal spikes on the top of the fixtures, then when they land, pow   they're shish-kabobs.",3
RORY,That's cruel.,3
BABETTE,You can't do that.,3
ANDREW,I'd rather have bird crap fall on my head.,3
LORELAI,There it is   our new town slogan.,3
RORY,I like it.,3
LORELAI,"I see coffee mugs, T-shirts.",3
RORY,Don't forget stuffed shish-kabobbed birds.,3
LORELAI,That moan when you squeeze them.,3
JESUS,Excuse me.,3
TAYLORory,"May I help you, sir?",3
JESUS,"Yes, I was looking for. . .ah, there she is. . .uh, Patricia.",3
LORELAI,"Patricia. . .well, well, well.",3
EVERYONE,,3
PATTY,Now stop it.,3
JESUS,,3
PATTY,"I'm right in the middle of something, Jesus, but I'll be right out. Patience.",3
JESUS,Okay.,3
TAYLORory,"Now, as we were saying. . .",3
BABETTE,"Who's the fox, Patty?",3
TAYLORory,,3
PATTY,"I met him at a funeral. Great guy, good dancer, Latin. . .",3
EVERYONE,Wooooooo!,3
TAYLORory,"People, order please.",3
LORELAI,"He better treat you right, this guy.",3
BABETTE,,3
PATTY,"Well, I just met him.",3
KIRK,I could look him up on the internet.,3
TAYLORory,"People, please! Now, due to the lack of response, we'll hold off on the bird spikes.",3
LUKE,Good.,3
LORELAI,Let Miss Patty's date begin.,3
BABETTE,It's a digital. I want a full visual account.,3
TAYLORory,"Hold it. There's one more issue that must be addressed before we can adjourn. All right. Now, that weird, taciturn fellow who's always walking around with his backpack has put in an absurd request to stage a protest in the town square.",3
LORELAI,The town loner?,3
LUKE,That guy still lives around here?,3
BABETTE,"Somewhere in the hills, right?",3
LUKE,I thought he was long gone.,3
ANDREW,,3
PATTY,He's a bit creepy.,3
TAYLORory,Very creepy.,3
LORELAI,"But he's our Boo Radley, and we don't have a Boo Radley, unless you count the troubadour or Pete the pizza guy or the guy who talks to mailboxes.",3
RORY,"Well, I think the point is that every town needs as many Boo Radleys as they can get.",3
LORELAI,,3
PATTY,"What's he protesting, Taylor?",3
TAYLORory,"Well, that's not indicated here, but it doesn't matter, because protesting is not allowed in the town square, period. It's un-American.",3
LUKE,You mean like the Revolutionary w*r?,3
BABETTE,And Rosa Parks?,3
TAYLORory,,3
PATTY,"Yes, dear, what is it?",3
JESUS,,3
PATTY,"No, he said buses, dear, not Jesus.",3
JESUS,Sounded like Jesus.,3
TAYLORory,Could this meet ing be more disrupted?,3
LORELAI,I could do a soft shoe.,3
RORY,"Yeah, while I pound out a beat on the bongos.",3
BABETTE,,3
PATTY,I got bongos in the back.,3
TAYLORory,"Seeing as how our attention spans are gnat-like tonight, as town Selectman I am refusing the town loner's request to protest and I am adjourning this meeting.",3
LORELAI,"She's all yours, Jesus!",3
LUKE,We got nothing of substance done in this meeting.,3
LORELAI,And the tradition stands.,3
LORELAI,"Hey, what do you know about this town loner guy?",3
LUKE,"Same as everyone. Just kind of skulks around with that backpack, never smiles.",3
LORELAI,Does he also make cheeseburgers and secretly harbor a desire to wear a backwards baseball cap?,3
LUKE,What?,3
LORELAI,"They're cousins, identical cousins. . .",3
LUKE,Stop it.,3
LORELAI,Well. . . look who's back behind the wheel. Lovely.,3
RORY,"Mom, I'm gonna get going. I've got some studying to do.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, babe. I'll catch up with you.",3
LORELAI,When did Jess get a car?,3
LUKE,"Oh, uh. . .recently.",3
LORELAI,Where'd he get it?,3
LUKE,"He got it from a guy around here, at a place.",3
LORELAI,A guy at a place?,3
LUKE,Yeah.,3
LORELAI,"You had no idea he had a car, did you?",3
LUKE,Not in the least.,3
LORELAI,"Ah, way to have a handle on things, Luke.",3
LUKE,"Well, he doesn't share a lot with me, you know? And he's got a license. What can I do?",3
LORELAI,Stop him before he kills.,3
LUKE,He's not gonna k*ll anyone.,3
LORELAI,He's got a bad track record with cars.,3
LUKE,"Yeah, I know, okay? I'm not exactly thrilled with this.",3
LORELAI,Okay. I'm sorry. It's your thing. I'll just butt out now.,3
LUKE,Where'd he get the money?,3
LORELAI,What?,3
LUKE,For the car. Where'd he get it?,3
LORELAI,I don't know. Working at the diner?,3
LUKE,I can barely afford a car on the money I get working at the diner.,3
LORELAI,Maybe it was a gift from someone. . .who doesn't know it's gone yet.,3
LUKE,Thanks.,3
LORELAI,"I'm helpful, aren't I?",3
LUKE,Bye.,3
LORELAI,Bye.,3
LUKE,Hey.,3
JESS,Hey.,3
LUKE,So. . .you got a car.,3
JESS,"Motor Trend's not gonna be giving it any awards, but it'll get me from point A to point B.",3
LUKE,"Yeah, I guess it'll get you around. So, uh. . .where'd you get the money for it?",3
JESS,Mugged an old lady.,3
LUKE,Jess.,3
JESS,It didn't cost that much.,3
LUKE,What's not much?,3
JESS,Less than a lot?,3
LUKE,"Jess, where did you get the money?",3
JESS,You know that hash you sling at the diner? I scrape it off the plates in the back. Remember I work for you?,3
LUKE,"Yeah, I know you do.",3
JESS,"Okay, then.",3
LUKE,I also know I don't pay you enough to buy the car.,3
JESS,I saved up my pennies and I bought the car from Gypsy. She gave me a good deal. That's how I got the car.,3
LUKE,"Okay, so you bought a car. Now, the price of the car is just one small thing. It's just the beginning.",3
JESS,"Oh, yeah?",3
LUKE,Did you take the additional expenses into account?,3
JESS,Like. . .,3
LUKE,Insurance?,3
JESS,I'm in good hands.,3
LUKE,"Liability, uninsured motorist?",3
JESS,All the paperwork's in the glove compartment. Feel free to check it out.,3
LUKE,Money for gas?,3
JESS,You mean this didn't come w ith a never empty magical t*nk?,3
LUKE,Jess.,3
JESS,I factored that in.,3
LUKE,You're gonna have repairs.,3
JESS,"Yeah, and I can fix most of them my self and save up for the rest. Plus, I'm gonna make sure to replace the oil every couple months.",3
LUKE,"Right, I bet you didn't think of that, the oil. That costs money.",3
JESS,I'm the one that brought it up. You're the one that didn't think of it.,3
LUKE,"No, but. . .I just. . .",3
JESS,Sign this.,3
LUKE,The registration?,3
JESS,I'm still a minor.,3
LUKE,I don't have a pen.,3
LUKE,I guess it's okay that someone else's name is crossed out on it and that yours it written in.,3
JESS,Yup.,3
LUKE,Just checking.,3
JESS,Thanks. I'm glad we had this talk.,3
LUKE,,3
LORELAI,Hello!,3
RORY,I'm in here!,3
LORELAI,"Wow, you beat me home by two minutes and your nose is already in the books.",3
RORY,I can go from zero to studying in less than sixty seconds.,3
LORELAI,Very impressive. Mail call.,3
RORY,What's this?,3
LORELAI,"Mortgage payment. You mind picking it up this month sweetie, baby, cookie, honey?",3
RORY,"No, not at all.",3
LORELAI,It's just something addressed to you.,3
RORY,It's an invitation.,3
LORELAI,Hm.,3
RORY,Oh.,3
LORELAI,"An invitation to what? Oh, is it the White House again? Those boys never give up.",3
RORY,It's to Sherry's baby shower.,3
LORELAI,Who?,3
RORY,Sherry. Sherry Tinsdale. Dad's Sherry?,3
LORELAI,You're kidding.,3
RORY,It's at her and Dad's house on Sunday.,3
LORELAI,"Wow, that is very weird. We haven't had contact with Christopher in months. She must know we're on the outs with him, right?",3
RORY,"Yeah, but she may not know how on the outs.",3
LORELAI,"Well, zero contact is maximum on the outs.",3
RORY,Yeah. . .although there may have been some.,3
LORELAI,Some w hat?,3
RORY,Some contact.,3
LORELAI,Oh. . .you've been in contact with Christopher?,3
RORY,"Yeah, I'm sorry.",3
LORELAI,"On, no, hon, don't apologize. You've always been totally free to talk to him whenever you want. I've told you that. I mean, he's your dad, right? So don't apologize.",3
RORY,"Okay, I take the apology back.",3
LORELAI,"I think it's good you've been talking to him. It is a little weird you didn't tell me, though.",3
RORY,"Yeah, sorry.",3
LORELAI,Will you stop apologizing?,3
RORY,"Even when I feel like I should apologize, I can't apologize?",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, it's a little annoying.",3
RORY,Sorry.,3
LORELAI,Rory.,3
RORY,I'm just trying to lighten the mood here.,3
LORELAI,The mood is light. I just hate that you thought you had to hide something like that from me.,3
RORY,I just kind of felt like I was betraying you or something.,3
LORELAI,"Well, you weren't.",3
RORY,I know that now.,3
LORELAI,"So, how much contact have you had with him?",3
RORY,"Not tons. He emailed me a mo nth or so ago, I emailed him back, and now we occasionally talk on the phone.",3
LORELAI,Does he ever ask about me?,3
RORY,What answer will freak you out the least?,3
LORELAI,The honest one.,3
RORY,"Yes, he asks about you because Dad will always care for you very much, you know that. Do you want me to say hello for you next time we talk?",3
LORELAI,No.,3
RORY,Fine. What should I do about this?,3
LORELAI,It's your call.,3
RORY,I guess being in Dad's world automatically means being in Sherry's.,3
LORELAI,And it is your little half brother or sister she's carrying.,3
RORY,"I know, it's weird.",3
LORELAI,Sort of a good reason to make some connection with her.,3
RORY,"Yeah, but it's gonna be one of those brunchy quichey things where I don't know anyone, and it's all the way in Boston.",3
LORELAI,I'll drive you there if you want.,3
RORY,Really?,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, I'll do some Bo ston shopping while you quiche it.",3
RORY,And we can set up some sort of SOS signal that I can page you with if I want to bail early?,3
LORELAI,Sure.,3
RORY,What should the SOS signal be?,3
LORELAI,How about. . .SOS?,3
RORY,Perfect.,3
LORELAI,So you're going.,3
RORY,I guess I'm going.,3
LORELAI,"Good, I think you've made the right decision.",3
RORY,So do I. And I shouldn't have hid that I'm talking to Dad. I'm really s ,3
LORELAI,Ah!,3
RORY,Starving.,3
LORELAI,,3
LUKE,You're up early.,3
JESS,I got a few errands to run.,3
LUKE,You got time before school?,3
JESS,I got wheels.,3
LUKE,"Right, right, you got wheels. Lid.",3
JESS,"By the way, I owe you ten bucks.",3
LUKE,When did I loan you ten bucks?,3
JESS,Last night.,3
LUKE,I wasn't here last night.,3
JESS,"You're always here, Uncle Luke   in my heart.",3
LUKE,You took money out of the register,3
JESS,I'm going to the bank now. You'll get it back today.,3
LUKE,"I told you a hundred times, do not take money out of the register.",3
JESS,Gotta run.,3
LUKE,Lid.,3
LUKE,"Oh, uh, what can I get you, Kirk?",3
KIRK,Patty melt and a coke.,3
LUKE,You want the melt cut into squares or stars today?,3
KIRK,Half and half?,3
LUKE,"Okay, coming right up.",3
KIRK,"Thanks. Man, that car's a honey. Duel piston cams, diplex overdrive with maximum torque, sixteen liter side by side, firing three on one. . . sweet.",3
LUKE,"Kirk, none of that makes any sense.",3
KIRK,What?,3
LUKE,"I know a little about cars, that was all gibberish.",3
KIRK,"Oh, well, would you mind not telling people about this? I've cultivated a reputation as sort of a car aficionado and in reality, all I have is a Jan and Dean record.",3
LUKE,I'll keep it to myself.,3
KIRK,I should probably listen to it again.,3
LUKE,"Yeah, I would.",3
KIRK,,3
GYPSY,You don't take care of it.,3
JACKSON,I take great care of it.,3
GYPSY,This truck doesn't like you.,3
JACKSON,"Oh, is it talking to you now?",3
GYPSY,Your transmission's shot.,3
JACKSON,I shift up and down a lot.,3
GYPSY,"Mr. Grind-it- til-you-find-it, huh?",3
JACKSON,Just tell me w hat needs doing.,3
GYPSY,Be faster to say what doesn't need doing.,3
JACKSON,Whatever you want.,3
GYPSY,"You ride your breaks. Bad for the truck, good for me. I like replacing brakes. Pays for the cable TV.",3
JACKSON,"No problem. How  bout I just make the check out directly to your cable company, would that be easier for you?",3
GYPSY,"Yeah, thanks. And get some ext ra checks  cause you're gonna be making one out to my milkman, too. Oh, and looky here, you just bought me a couch. Hey Luke.",3
LUKE,Hey Gypsy. I don't wanna interrupt.,3
JACKSON,"No, please, interrupt. I need a little break from the gaiety.",3
GYPSY,What can I do for you?,3
LUKE,"Uh, well, uh, Jess came home w ith this car and it says on the slip that he bought it from you.",3
GYPSY,"Yup, it's working great, if that's what you're wondering.",3
LUKE,"No, I know that, it's just, uh. . . he paid you for it, right?",3
GYPSY,Nothing's free at Gypsy's.,3
LUKE,And he paid cash?,3
GYPSY,Mostly twenties.,3
LUKE,"Did you make sure Andrew Jackson was on the bills, not Alfred E. Newman or someone?",3
GYPSY,Looked real to me.,3
LUKE,"Well, when he took the money out of wherever he had it, did a mask or a g*n fall out?",3
GYPSY,"No, but he was carrying it in a canvas bag with a big dollar sign on it.",3
LUKE,Really?,3
GYPSY,No.,3
LUKE,Good.,3
GYPSY,Guys are stupid.,3
LUKE,What?,3
GYPSY,"You strip your gears, you ride your breaks, and if we don't laugh after we make a joke, you think we're serious.",3
JACKSON,I don't ride my brakes!,3
LUKE,I just want to make sure it was on the up and up.,3
GYPSY,"Hey, when people come in with cash, I don't ask where it comes from, do you?",3
LUKE,"Nah, I guess I don't. Thanks.",3
GYPSY,Anytime.,3
GYPSY,,3
TAYLORory,This is outrageous. The town unanimously refused to let that loner freak protest in the square. Why would the two of you consider allowing him to do it from the steps of your church?,3
REVEREND,"The town didn't refuse him, Taylor   you did.",3
TAYLORory,"So you're spearheading this revolt, Reverend?",3
RABBI,"Reverend Skinner and I share the church for services, Taylor, so if there's gonna be a protest, it'll be a joint decision. Ugh, I can't even look at this mayonnaise.",3
REVEREND,"I got it, David.",3
RABBI,"Thanks, Archie.",3
TAYLORory,"I could still ban it. I could get the town council together, find something on the books. I'm sure there's a way.",3
REVEREND,"The church is exempt from your town statutes, Taylor.",3
RABBI,We answer to a higher authority. . . like the hot dog.,3
REVEREND,I laugh every time you say that.,3
RABBI,I know. Funny is funny.,3
TAYLORory,"Well, I can guarantee that God does not want this either.",3
REVEREND,"Did you hear that, David? Taylor Doose is in direct communication with God.",3
RABBI,"Thirty years I'm working for God, I haven't received so much as a card.",3
REVEREND,"Is it by phone that you speak with him, Taylor?",3
RABBI,"Do you have a God phone, Taylor?",3
TAYLORory,"Rabbi, please.",3
REVEREND,What's he like? For us common folk who've never met him?,3
RABBI,"Is he short, is he tall?",3
REVEREND,Does he like to laugh?,3
RABBI,"Is the whole shellfish thing really serious? Because, I gotta tell you, some of these Red Lobster commer cials. . .",3
REVEREND,"They look good, huh?",3
RABBI,"Oh, with the melted butter? Oh my God.",3
TAYLORory,Can we stay serious for a minute here?,3
REVEREND,"You're too uptight, Taylor.",3
RABBI,"And no matter how much steam blows out of your ears, our decision will be final.",3
TAYLORory,"So it's hardball, huh? Well, the council gave you special permission to run bingo out of that building. We could withdraw it.",3
RABBI,At your peril.,3
TAYLORory,Meaning?,3
RABBI,"You're gonna tell my little old ladies, my bubbies, you're shutting down their bingo?",3
TAYLORory,"I'm not afraid of your bubbies, Rabbi.",3
REVEREND,"Oh, God, thank you for letting me be in the room when Taylor said that.",3
TAYLORory,"Well, gentlemen, I would sincerely like to thank you for wasting my time.",3
REVEREND,"Our pleasure, Taylor.",3
TAYLORory,"I can't believe that you, Reverend Skinner, of all people, would do this to me after all the support I've given you over the years.",3
REVEREND,"All the support? Taylor, you're a Sunday Protestant. You come in, you say  Hi God', you sing a song, and you leave.",3
TAYLORory,I always leave a dollar!,3
REVEREND,"For your singing voice, you should leave two.",3
TAYLORory,"Well, fine, if you feel like that, maybe I will just stop showing up altogether. Maybe I'll convert to something else and give them my generous weekly donation.",3
REVEREND,Do you want him?,3
RABBI,Not after the whole bubbies thing.,3
REVEREND,Maybe the Shakers in Woodbury would take him.,3
RABBI,"Yeah, he's already got the beard. Can you make furniture, Taylor?",3
TAYLORory,Goodbye gentlemen.,3
LUKE,How's it going?,3
CAESARory,"Ah, pretty slow.",3
LUKE,"Hey, is Jess upstairs?",3
CAESARory,I haven't seen him.,3
LUKE,"Okay, thanks.",3
LUKE,Jess?,3
LUKE,,3
RORY,So do you think I got a good gift?,3
LANE,It's foolproof.,3
RORY,It's not very original.,3
LANE,A new mother can't have too many baby blankets. Not with the insane amount of stuff constantly oozing out of a baby's every orifice.,3
RORY,Ew.,3
LANE,I just call it like I see it.,3
RORY,"Well, call it less graphically.",3
LANE,The very concept of childbirth is vaguely disturbing.,3
RORY,"Yeah. Kids are cool and all, but getting there seems like a big cosmic joke.",3
LANE,Definitely thought up by a man.,3
RORY,My mom said that when she told me where babies come from.,3
LANE,My mom still hasn't told me.,3
RORY,Really?,3
LANE,"When my cousin got pregnant, she said it's because an angel brushed its wings against her face.",3
RORY,I could fill you in on the details sometime if you want.,3
LANE,"No thanks, I've picked it up off the streets.",3
LANE,That's new.,3
RORY,Is it?,3
LANE,"I've never seen it before, and I'm very into the minutia around here.",3
RORY,That's for sure.,3
LANE,Do you know whose it is?,3
RORY,Yup.,3
LANE,Whose?,3
RORY,Jess'.,3
LANE,"Jess? Jess, the guy who wrecked your car? He's got a car now?",3
RORY,"Mmhmm, looks that way.",3
LANE,That's outrageous! That's a travesty!,3
RORY,It's not that big a deal.,3
LANE,"Oh, it's a humongous deal.",3
RORY,You're taking this very hard.,3
LANE,"Because we're best friends, Rory. We're linked. I feel what you feel. Except for right now because you don't seem to be feeling anything and I'm incensed.",3
RORY,It's just a car. It's nothing to get excited about.,3
JESS,Hey.,3
RORY,Hey.,3
JESS,Hey Lane.,3
LANE,"Hey back at ya, tough guy.",3
JESS,What?,3
RORY,Lane. . .,3
JESS,Something wrong?,3
RORY,No. . .,3
LANE,Yes! You have a car.,3
JESS,I know.,3
LANE,Don't give me lip!,3
JESS,Lip?,3
RORY,Lane. . .,3
LANE,"How'd you get the car, Jess?",3
JESS,I bought it.,3
LANE,"Really, I thought you might've built it from parts left over from cars you've totaled.",3
JESS,What is your problem?,3
LANE,Don't play dumb. You know what you did.,3
JESS,I gotta go.,3
LANE,"Yes, drive on away, we'll just keep walking. That's all Rory's been able to do these past few months   lots of walking. She's got bunions because of you, mister!",3
JESS,Bunions?,3
RORY,I don't have bunions.,3
LANE,She's too nice to complain about her foot ailments.,3
JESS,"Knock if off, Lane.",3
RORY,"Just get in the car and go, Jess.",3
JESS,I didn't start this.,3
LANE,"Well, you started it when you wrecked Rory's car.",3
JESS,Tell your friend to walk it off.,3
RORY,You walk it off.,3
JESS,I'm trying to drive off.,3
RORY,Then go.,3
JESS,"Geez, how Andy Griffith is this town that people get so excited by a car?",3
RORY,"It's not the car, it's who's got the car.",3
JESS,"Okay, fine, you want it? Take it, I'm sick of this.",3
RORY,I don't want this piece of junk.,3
JESS,"Right. I suppose Dean is already building you another car, something really snazzy.",3
RORY,Shut up and go.,3
JESS,Gladly.,3
RORY,Let's go.,3
LANE,Gladly.,3
RORY,,3
LORELAI,This must be the place.,3
RORY,I think the balloons confirm it.,3
LORELAI,"No pink, no blue.",3
RORY,All green.,3
LORELAI,"Aren't baby shower balloons supposed to reflect the sex of the baby? Blue for boys, pink for girls.",3
RORY,You would think.,3
LORELAI,"What's green for, aliens?",3
RORY,I'll ask when I go in.,3
LORELAI,"We're all set, right? Anytime you want out, just send up a flare.",3
RORY,I will.,3
LORELAI,"Even if I'm half-naked in a changing room, I'll just grab everything and rush out.",3
RORY,You making a half-naked entrance would be funny.,3
SHERRY,Hi!,3
RORY,Whoa!,3
SHERRY,"Oh, I'm sorry, I totally snuck up on you.",3
RORY,"It's okay, hi.",3
SHERRY,"Hi, Rory. Lorelai, I'm so excited you came.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, I'm just dropping Rory off.",3
SHERRY,"Oh, don't go. Stay.",3
LORELAI,What?,3
SHERRY,"Come to the party, please?",3
LORELAI,"Oh, I don't know.",3
SHERRY,"I know that you weren't invited, but it's just  cause my friends didn't think that you'd be comfortable. I told them not to worry.",3
LORELAI,"Thanks, but I'm not really dressed for a party.",3
SHERRY,"Oh, please. We're not formal here, you look fine.",3
LORELAI,Well. . .um. . .,3
RORY,"Um, Mom kind of has plans.",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, I got a couple credit cards burning a hole in my wallet.",3
SHERRY,"Oh, go shopping some other time and come play with us. Please? There's just a bunch of people in there that Rory doesn't know, and having you here would make her so much more comfortable.",3
RORY,"Oh, I don't mind not knowing anyone at the party, really.",3
SHERRY,"That's nice, honey, but very unconvincing. Lorelai, I meant to extend the invitation to both of you. I just wasn't sure if you'd. . . Well, you know, there's lots of food, and booze for the lucky non-pregnant ones, and cake. . .it'll be fun.",3
LORELAI,Well. . .,3
SHERRY,I'll block your car with my stomach.,3
LORELAI,,3
SHERRY,"Please, it would mean so much.",3
LORELAI,"Well. . . um, okay, sure.",3
SHERRY,Really?,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, let's have a party.",3
SHERRY,Yay!,3
LORELAI,"Ooh, watch it, you'll jiggle that thing right out of you.",3
SHERRY,,3
SHERRY,"Come in , come in .",3
LORELAI,Nice place.,3
RORY,Very nice.,3
SHERRY,"Well, it's a work-in-progress. It was so bachelor pad",3

LUKE,What about that one?,3
LORELAI,"Hm, no.",3
LUKE,Why not?,3
LORELAI,Too pale.,3
LUKE,So what?,3
LORELAI,Pale means sickly.,3
LUKE,Or sunscreen.,3
LORELAI,Or Mad Cow Disease.,3
LUKE,Pale does not mean Mad Cow Disease.,3
LORELAI,Have you ever had Mad Cow Disease?,3
LUKE,Twice last week and my coloring was wonderful.,3
LORELAI,"I need a great dance partner this year. Someone strong, non-clutzy, with lots of stamina. Ooh, how tall is that guy?",3
LUKE,"Mrs. Coulter's about 6'2"".",3
LORELAI,"Oh. Four years in a row, I have come this close to winning. Last year, I swear to God, I had it!",3
LUKE,I know the story.,3
LORELAI,It was hour twenty-three.,3
Posted,11/23/02 23:46,3
LUKE,I know the story.,3
LORELAI,I'm dancing with Henry Ho-Ho McAphie the third.,3
LUKE,How many people heard me say I know the story?,3
LORELAI,"And Ho-Ho's fading, so I'm trying to buck him up, saying ""Come on, Ho-Ho. Stay with me Ho-Ho,"" and then all of a sudden he starts yelling, ""Stop calling me Ho-Ho, it's making me hungry!""",3
LUKE,"Oh, hey, look, there goes Tommy Tune.",3
LORELAI,"And out of nowhere, Kirk comes dancing by, waving a McDonald's hot apple pie in the air and of course Ho-Ho lunges for the pie and drops my hand and that was it. Kirk wins, I'm out. I'm gonna get that Ho-Ho someday.",3
LUKE,I'll help ya.,3
LORELAI,I wanna win.,3
LUKE,I know you do.,3
LORELAI,I need a partner.,3
LUKE,You'll get one. Keep looking.,3
LORELAI,Mm.,3

LUKE,"Pancakes, right? Coming right up.",3
TAYLORory,"Breathe in deep, folks. Smells like fall.",3
LUKE,"Get out, Taylor.",3
TAYLORory,Why?,3
LUKE,Just a code I live by.,3
TAYLORory,"Oh. . .pffft. . .you. Listen, I'd like to run a little something by you.",3
LUKE,"I'm busy, Taylor.",3
TAYLORory,I was just thinking how nice it would be if you could set up a little coffee stand at the marathon.,3
LUKE,Coffee stand.,3
TAYLORory,"Yes. I mean, these people have to try and stay up for twenty-four hours. What better tohelp you stay up than a cup of nice strong cup of coffee, huh? What do you say?",3
LUKE,Sure.,3
TAYLORory,Really?,3
LUKE,For a buck a cup.,3
TAYLORory,"Luke, this marathon is a charitable event.",3
LUKE,"Taylor, we have been raising money to restore that stupid bridge for eight years.",3
TAYLORory,We're not raising money to restore the bridge.,3
LUKE,We're not?,3
TAYLORory,"No, we have that money. The Tennessee Williams lookalike contest last month put us right over the top.",3
LUKE,Then what the hell is this dumb thing for?,3
TAYLORory,A tarp.,3
LUKE,A what?,3
TAYLORory,To cover the bridge.,3
LUKE,"This is a first, Taylor. I actually need to sit down.",3
TAYLORory,"Well, Luke, you know as well as I do that if we start renovations now, heading right into the snow and rainy part of the season, then everything we do is gonna get ruined, and there we are   back at square one. If we are gonna do this right, then we are going to need a tarp.",3
LUKE,"Taylor, you are asking me to donate free coffee to hundreds of people so you can raise money to buy a tarp.",3
TAYLORory,How  bout fifty cents a cup?,3
LUKE,How  bout I charge for cream?,3
TAYLORory,"You would kick Tiny Tim's crutch out from under him, wouldn't you?",3
LUKE,"If he asks for a free cup of coffee, gimpy's going down.",3
LORELAI,,3
LORELAI,"This is amazing chicken, Mom. I mean it, really great.",3
EMILY,"Thank you, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,It's like super chicken. I bet it could fly. Have you tried tossing it out the window?,3
EMILY,"All right, what's going on?",3
LORELAI,What? I like the chicken.,3
EMILY,"Nobody likes the chicken that much, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,I'm in a good mood.,3
EMILY,Why?,3
LORELAI,"My God, it's my ninth grade homecoming dance all over again.",3
RORY,Homecoming dance?,3
LORELAI,"In ninth grade, I got asked to the homecoming dance and I didn't think I would, and I was in a really good mood, and Mom got so annoyed that she made me go to my room.",3
RORY,Grandma?,3
EMILY,She was sitting at the table giving all the peas voices.,3
LORELAI,"With a little encouragement, I could've been the Senor Wences of the vegetable set.",3
EMILY,Lorelai.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, okay, okay. It'll come out soon enough. Today, ladies and gentlemen, I found a dance partner.",3
RORY,You did?,3
LORELAI,A good one.,3
EMILY,"What are you talking about, a dance partner? A dance partner for what?",3
LORELAI,Our town is having a dance marathon this weekend.,3
RORY,It lasts twenty-four hours and the last couple left standing gets a trophy.,3
LORELAI,A big trophy.,3
EMILY,"Well, that sounds very nice.",3
RORY,All the proceeds go to charity.,3
LORELAI,Which is great   but did I mention the trophy?,3
RORY,I believe you did.,3
LORELAI, Cause it's big.,3
EMILY,Charitable events are wonderful things to take part in. There's nothing more rewarding than devoting yourself to making someone else's life better.,3
LORELAI,And whose life isn't better with a truly gigantic trophy around?,3
RORY,So who'd you get to dance with you?,3
LORELAI,Stanley Appleman.,3
RORY,Who's Stanley Appleman?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, he's brand new in town. He works over at the hardware store, and the best part is, he used to be part of the touring company. . .of Riverdance.",3
RORY,Score!,3
LORELAI,"I know! I'm completely jazzed. How  bout you, Mr. Potato? I'm completely jazzed, too.",3
EMILY,What's that?,3
LORELAI,I think that's me.,3
EMILY,"Lorelai, I've told you a hundred times to turn that thing off when you come to dinner here.",3
LORELAI,"I know, Mom. I'm sorry.",3
EMILY,Can't you let it go to voice mail?,3
LORELAI,"Well, see, I left Michel alone at the inn, and he's dealing with the roofers. I told him to call me if there was any trouble.",3
EMILY,Is that true?,3
RORY,I'm gonna let Mr. Potato field this one.,3
EMILY,I thought so.,3
LORELAI,"Hello? . . . What? . . . Oh, no no, no no, don't tell me that. . .Well, did you tell her how big the trophy is, because I am really not exaggerating here. . . How did your wife get a picture of me? Stanley, that is crazy! I don't wanna sleep with you. . . Did you tell her I don't wanna sleep with you? . . . Well, put her on the phone. I'll tell her I don't wanna sleep with you. . . Well, somebody has to tell her I don't wanna sleep with you. . . Why are you insulted all of a sudden? . . . Stanley? . . .",3
LORELAI,Great.,3
RORY,What happened?,3
LORELAI,Stanley bailed.,3
RORY,No! Why?,3
LORELAI,"Apparently, Miss Patty showed his wife a picture of me, and she thinks I look like Elizabeth Taylor, which makes her Debbie Reynolds, and Stanley Eddie Fisher.",3
RORY,That's crazy.,3
LORELAI,"Especially if you've seen Stanley. He's no Eddie Fisher, trust me. Fisher Stevens, maybe.",3
RORY,Can't you talk to her?,3
LORELAI,"Apparently, only at my own risk.",3
EMILY,"Well, at least she thought you looked like Elizabeth Taylor. That was nice.",3
LORELAI,I have no partner.,3
RORY,You'll find another one.,3
EMILY,Elizabeth Taylor always did.,3
RORY,"There's someone else out there, trust me.",3
LORELAI,I guess.,3
EMILY,Here. Have some mo re chicken.,3
LORELAI,"Thanks, Mom.",3
EMILY,"And if you'd like, later on, you can make my asparagus talk.",3
LORELAI,,3
PARIS,"Okay, so, let's talk about Saturday.",3
RORY,What about Saturday?,3
PARIS,I think we need to work. The seventy-fifth anniversary issue of the Franklin comes out next month and I want it to be amazing.,3
RORY,I've got some great cover art lined up.,3
PARIS,"Old pictures, new pictures?",3
RORY,Collage style with kind of a sepia-toned finish to it. Very classy.,3
PARIS,"Okay, I like it. Time!",3
LOUISE,See ya.,3
MADELINE,Bye.,3
MADELINE,"So, what were we talking about?",3
PARIS,Working Saturday on the seventy-fifth anniversary issue.,3
LOUISE,Thanks for asking.,3
MADELINE,"But you guys already have some decent stuff planned out, right?",3
PARIS,Madeline -- or may I call you Spicoli?,3
MADELINE,If you have to.,3
PARIS,"This is the seventy-fifth anniversary issue. There is only going to be one seventy-fifth anniversary issue ever, and it's on our watch. We screw this up and we basically mooned a piece of history. Is that what you want? To B.A. history?",3
MADELINE,But I don't understand. Last year was the seventy-fourth anniversary issue of the Franklin.,3
PARIS,So?,3
MADELINE,So there's only gonna be one seventy-fourth anniversary issue ever and we didn't do anything special for it.,3
LOUISE,I think the cover was of a deep-fried Mars bar.,3
PARIS,That's because nobody cares about the seventy-fourth anniversary issue.,3
MADELINE,I bet the person who worked on it seventy-four years ago did.,3
PARIS,We're working Saturday!,3
PARIS,"""Why are we working Saturday, Paris? What's so special about the seventy-fifth issue, Paris? Why does my head feel so light and yet not float away, Paris?""",3
RORY,What?,3
PARIS,What's he doing here?,3
RORY,I bet he's here to see you.,3
PARIS,He hasn't called me once. I haven't seen or heard from him since we had our date in Washington three months ago.,3
RORY,Maybe he wants to explain why.,3
PARIS,He was supposed to go away and never come back. I already wrote his name in my revenge notebook.,3
RORY,"Paris, he knows you're standing here talking about him.",3
PARIS,What does he want?,3
RORY,Go over there and find out.,3
PARIS,What do you want?,3
JAMIE,"I'm on break from school, I thought I'd come down and see you.",3
PARIS,But you never called.,3
JAMIE,I know.,3
PARIS,You lost my number?,3
JAMIE,"Nope, I memo rized your number.",3
PARIS,You didn't wanna use my number?,3
JAMIE,I was starting classes.,3
PARIS,In phone dialing? How's it going?,3
JAMIE,"Look, Paris, this year's very important for me. I thought the last thing I needed was a distraction.",3
PARIS,"Well, I totally understand. This year's very important for me, too. I'm focusing on getting into Harvard, and the last thing that I need is a distraction. . . so, good move. You saved us both a lot of distractions. Thank you, and good luck. I need my hand.",3
JAMIE,"If I let go, how fast will you run away?",3
PARIS,3.2 seconds.,3
JAMIE,I thought so. Hey Rory.,3
RORY,Hey Jamie. How's Princeton?,3
JAMIE,"It's good. Crazy, but  ",3
PARIS,Let go.,3
JAMIE,No.,3
PARIS,Yes.,3
JAMIE,Paris.,3
PARIS,"Look, you don't have to be nice, you don't have to tie up loose ends. I get it, I'm a distraction. Now either pull a Boxing Helena, or give me back my hand.",3
JAMIE,"Yes, talking to you would've been a distraction.",3
PARIS,"I know. I heard you already. My God, find a pirate to sit on, okay?",3
JAMIE,"However, not talking to you has turned out to be impossible.",3
PARIS,What?,3
JAMIE,I flunked a pop quiz in poli-sci because I couldn't stop thinking about you. Still want your hand back?,3
PARIS,I've got another.,3
JAMIE,"I've thought a lot about this, and apparently you're a distraction that I'm supposed to have.",3
PARIS,You didn't have a bad time on the date?,3
JAMIE,Are you busy right now?,3
PARIS,Well  ,3
RORY,"No, we're done. She's free.",3
JAMIE,Good. Let's go get some coffee. Bye Rory.,3
RORY,Bye Jamie.,3
PARIS,He took my books.,3
RORY,,3
RORY,Well?,3
LANE,Still ringing. He's home.,3
RORY,How'd he sound?,3
LANE,Homey.,3
RORY,Nice.,3
DEAN,"I know this is a stupid question, but why can't you just talk to him?",3
LANE,"Because yesterday he called to say that they were still looking for a rehearsal space and, uh, that he'd call when he had more news. So now I have to wait until he calls about the band   and in between, I call and hang up on him. Pathetic.",3
RORY,Not so pathetic. I used to hang up on Dean all the time.,3
DEAN,You did?,3
LANE,I rememb er that.,3
DEAN,When did you hang up on me?,3
RORY,Right when we first met.,3
DEAN,You should've just said something.,3
RORY,I couldn't do that.,3
DEAN,Why not?,3
RORY,Because then you would've known that I was calling and therefore that I liked you.,3
DEAN,"Yes, but I liked you, too.",3
RORY,"Well, I know that now.",3
DEAN,You could've known that then.,3
RORY,"Dean, please. This is a girl thing.",3
DEAN,"Uh, okay. Tell me w hen I'm supposed to pay attention again.",3
LANE,I'm gonna love him forever and he's never gonna know it.,3
DEAN,He would if you coughed.,3
RORY,Dean.,3
DEAN,Sorry.,3
LANE,At least he's at home an d not out with a girl.,3
RORY,Very true.,3
DEAN,He could be home w ith a girl.,3
RORY,Dean.,3
DEAN,"Sitting here, staring at my pizza.",3
LANE,You think he was at home w ith a girl?,3
RORY,"No, no, I don't.",3
LANE,I'm gonna call again.,3
RORY,"Good idea, and pay attention to the background noise this time.",3
LORELAI,"Ooh, cool, pizza.",3
RORY,Shh. She's calling Dave to see if she can hear a girl in the background.,3
LORELAI,Oh.,3
DEAN,I voted that she actually say something.,3
LORELAI,"You're a boy, you know nothing about this.",3
RORY,"Well, what'd you hear?",3
LANE,Quadrophenia.,3
RORY,"Classy, but not date-like.",3
LANE,You think?,3
RORY,Definitely.,3
DEAN,What if he met a girl who's a major Who fan?,3
LANE,What?,3
RORY,Why are you causing trouble?,3
LORELAI,"Rory, can I talk to you in the kitchen?",3
RORY,"Oh, sure. Be good.",3
DEAN,Go ahead.,3
RORY,"Okay, so, what's on your mind?",3
LORELAI,I think I figured out who can be my dance partner for the marathon.,3
RORY,Great! Who?,3
RORY,Bye.,3
LORELAI,Come on!,3
RORY,Forget it.,3
LORELAI,"Just hear me out. First of all, you love me.",3
RORY,"Not right at this moment, I don't.",3
LORELAI,You know how much this contest means to me. You'd never fall asleep or chase a pie.,3
RORY,I do not dance.,3
LORELAI,"It'll be fun. We'll get all dressed up, and you're light   easy to hold up when you get tired.",3
RORY,Mom.,3
LORELAI,"Plus, we got the whole mother/daughter gimmic k going for us. The crowd'll eat that up.",3
RORY,I cannot dance with you.,3
LORELAI,Why not?,3
RORY,"Because this is Dean's first marathon. We were gonna go and watch and hang out, he's totally looking forward to it. I told him about how Andrew gets in a fight with his date in the first fifteen minutes and storms off the floor. I told him about Taylor getting punch-drunk at hour fifteen and telling stories about how he always wanted to be a magician.",3
LORELAI,"Rory, please.",3
RORY,"And ooh, I told him about how when Kirk wins, he likes to take his victory lap around the floor to the theme from Rocky. I was gonna show him all those things, and I was gonna show them to him sitting down.",3
LORELAI,"He can still come, and he can still see all those things, except if you dance, maybe that victory lap will be you and me in stead of Kirk.",3
RORY,"Okay, I'll tell you what. I was supposed to work on the Franklin this weekend with Paris.",3
LORELAI,But?,3
RORY,"I will ask her if we can reschedule. If she says yes, then I will dance with you.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, I love ya!",3
RORY,You should sell cars.,3
LORELAI,,3
TEACHERory,"Take note of its form before treated. Make sure that your notes are completely legible since you will be turning them in with your result. Miss Gellar, hello.",3
PARIS,"Sorry I'm late, Mrs. Savitt.",3
TEACHERory,Is everything okay?,3
PARIS,Yes. I overslept.,3
TEACHERory,You're kidding.,3
PARIS,"No, it won't happen again.",3
TEACHERory,"Well, good. Okay, everyone, let's get to work.",3
RORY,"Paris, hi. Listen, I need to ask you something.",3
PARIS,sh**t.,3
RORY,"Well, there's this big event that's happening in my town. . .",3
PARIS,Pig race?,3
RORY,Dance marathon.,3
PARIS,I was close.,3
RORY,"It's on Saturday, and it's a twenty-four hour thing and my mother really wants to win, and her partner bailed on her and, long story short, I was wondering if there was anyway we could move this Saturday's Franklin thing to next Saturday.",3
PARIS,Okay.,3
MADELINE,What did she say?,3
LOUISE,I don't know. What did you say?,3
PARIS,I said yes.,3
LOUISE,She said yes.,3
MADELINE,She said yes.,3
LOUISE,Are you free on Saturday?,3
GUY,"Uh, no.",3
LOUISE,What about you? Come on   speak.,3
MADELINE,"Louise, I got two over here!",3
PARIS,"So, we're done, right?",3
RORY,You had a good time yesterday.,3
PARIS,What was yesterday?,3
RORY,Yesterday was the day that you were all freaked out about the seventy-fifth anniversary issue of the Franklin and today's the day you're not.,3
PARIS,"Rory, just because I agreed to postpone a newspaper session does in no way imply  ",3
RORY,You can't even stop smiling.,3
PARIS,"I can, too.",3
RORY,Tell me.,3
PARIS,"Okay. Well, we went for coffee, and he talked about how he had a great time on our date, and how he finds me fascinating, and how he thought about me all the time. Okay, there, happy?",3
RORY,"Wow, he likes you.",3
PARIS,I left an impression.,3
RORY,You sure did.,3
PARIS,"I still don't understand why he'd wanna date me. He's surrounded by college girls all day long who must be prettier than I am, and more experienced than I am. I mean, I'm sure they're all idiots, but usually that's the last thing a guy thinks about when he's looking for a date for the big game.",3
RORY,"Well, Jamie mu st be special.",3
PARIS,Or Ted Bundy.,3
RORY,Absolutely. It's either one or the other.,3
PARIS,Hey. Can you do me a f avor?,3
RORY,Okay.,3
PARIS,Don't say anything to Madeline or Louise about this.,3
RORY,About Jamie?,3
PARIS,Yeah.,3
RORY,But they're your best friends.,3
PARIS,"Theoretically, yes, but the second I mention a guy they're gonna both start singing the theme from the Trojan Man commer cial, and I just can't take that, okay?",3
RORY,No one knows until you give the word.,3
PARIS,,3
LORELAI,"I have to say, for a couple of modern girls, we have time-warped with the best of them.",3
RORY,Mm.,3
LORELAI,"How ya doing there, champ?",3
RORY,Early.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, it's a tad early.",3
RORY,No sun.,3
LORELAI,"Well, he's not up yet.",3
RORY,I can't even open my eyes.,3
LORELAI,"That's okay, there's nothing to see. Kirk's in a Speedo, Taylor's in a skirt, Al's in assless chaps.",3
RORY,"Oh my God, stop. I'm never gonna be able to close my eyes again.",3
LORELAI,Morning Babette.,3
BABETTE,"Oh, morning sugar. You guys look terrific.",3
LORELAI,Thank you.,3
RORY,"Babette, can I lay down on the table while Mom signs in?",3
BABETTE,"Not an early bird, huh?",3
LORELAI,"I need to get some coffee in her and we'll be fine. Kirk, however, is gonna be crying like a little teeny girl.",3
BABETTE,"So what else is new? Okay, now you two go get your physicals, bring your release forms inside, and they'll get you a number.",3
LORELAI,"Thanks. Come on, Snoozy.",3
SOOKIE,"Hey, wait up!",3
LORELAI,"Oh, wow, look at you!",3
SOOKIE,Is it fabulous?,3
LORELAI,It is fabulous.,3
SOOKIE,Wait  til you see Jackson's suit. It makes me want to ration sugar.,3
LORELAI,Where is Jackson?,3
SOOKIE,"Oh, we already had our checkups, so he's going to sign us in and scope out a good spot on the floor.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, it's so cool to be married. You have your own spot-scoper.",3
RORY,I'm gonna go say hi to Lane.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, hon, hurry back. Rememb er, the sooner we get inspected, the sooner we get coffee.",3
RORY,"Yeah, coffee.",3
SOOKIE,"Okay, I have a problem.",3
LORELAI,"Sookie, it's five-thirty in the morning. How can you already have a problem?",3
SOOKIE,Because I'm a multi-tasker.,3
LORELAI,Hit me.,3
SOOKIE,"Last night, I made coq au vin for dinner, so of course the subject of children came up.",3
LORELAI,Of course.,3
SOOKIE,"All of a sudden, completely out of the blue, Jackson announces he wants four in four.",3
LORELAI,He wants what?,3
SOOKIE,Four in four. Four kids in four years.,3
LORELAI,Good Lord!,3
SOOKIE,I know!,3
LORELAI,"Well, who's he gonna have these kids with?",3
SOOKIE,"Me, apparently.",3
LORELAI,What did you say?,3
SOOKIE,"See, here's where, uh, the problem comes in.",3
LORELAI,What?,3
SOOKIE,I think I said yes.,3
LORELAI,How is that possible?,3
SOOKIE,"Well, I was totally shocked when he announced it and I sort of said, ""O. . kay"" and . . but I think he took it as, ""Okay!"" So, apparently, now I have to get busy.",3
LORELAI,Do you want four in four?,3
SOOKIE,"No. But, I mean, I want kids. You know I want kids.",3
LORELAI,I know you want kids.,3
SOOKIE,But I thought maybe one. Two if the first one is really quiet.,3
LORELAI,"Well, honey, you have to tell Jackson that.",3
SOOKIE,I can't.,3
LORELAI,"Sookie, this is not like the fruit bowl his mother gave you. You can't stick four kids in the attic and just pull them out at Christmas.",3
SOOKIE,"I know, but Jackson and I have never had a real fight. We're still newlyweds. We still sneak out of bed in the morning to brush our teeth, then get back in bed and pretend we just woke up smelling like that.",3
LORELAI,You don't have much of a marriage if you can't talk about the important things.,3
SOOKIE,I know. Do you think I'm crazy to not want four in four?,3
LORELAI,"Four kids is a lot, and four years without a cocktail . . .",3
SOOKIE,"Wow, hadn't thought of that.",3
LORELAI,Glad to shed some mu ch-needed perspective on the situation.,3
SOOKIE,,3
RORY,Are you sure you don't need some help?,3
LANE,"Yeah, it's okay. I finally got a really good footing.",3
RORY,What is that stuff?,3
LANE,Eggless egg salad. Though this year my mom added food coloring to make the egg-like product look more eggy.,3
RORY,Smart.,3
LANE,"And every sandwich comes with your own personal pamphlet ""Dancing for the Devil,"" an illustrated look at the effect of dancing on your chances of spending all eternity in hell.",3
RORY,"Boy, her flames are getting really good.",3
LANE,"Well, she just bought a new color printer. You can do a ton of stuff with it.",3
RORY,,3
KIM,"Lane, get scooping! The minute air hits the bread, it starts to stale.",3
LANE,"Okay, Mama.",3
RORY,I'm gonna stop by later and say hi.,3
LANE,Please do.,3
RORY,,3
KIM,You have a pamphlet?,3
RORY,,3
KIM,Take one to your mother.,3
NURSE,Next.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, good, just in time.",3
RORY,Sorry.,3
LORELAI,"Hi there. Um, this is Rory Gilmore and I'm Lorelai Gilmore.",3
NURSE,Lorelai Gilmore?,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, L   o   r . . .",3
NURSE,You don't look like you've recently suffered a face-altering car crash.,3
LORELAI,"Uh, excuse me?",3
NURSE,"You're also supposed to have buck teeth, a club foot, and alopecia.",3
LORELAI,"Oh. I'm sorry, who told you this?",3
NURSE,My husband.,3
LORELAI,"Your husband? Well, who's . . .Stanley Appleman. Your husband is Stanley Appleman.",3
NURSE,Mmhmm.,3
LORELAI,,3
TAYLORory,"Any couple without a number will be disqualified. All couples must be touching at all times. All couples must remain moving at all times. The only time you may stop moving or stop touching is when you hear this horn. That sound means you have ten minutes. Ten minutes to get a drink, to eat a snack, take a rest, or whatever it is you can do in ten minutes. And in addition to the ten-minute rest periods, every person participating has been issued a yellow emergency card. In case of emergency, a contestant may hold up the card and leave the floor for ten minutes. If your partner remains on the floor and moving the entire time, then the owner of the yellow card may rejoin them and the contest. First aid is available in Miss Patty's. Please, rememb er, that if you feel yourself getting lightheaded or having sh**ting pains or any other stroke- like symptoms, please move off to the side so that your collapse will not get in the way of the other dancers. All right, people, lace your shoes, pin those curls, because we only have three minutes left until we start.",3
LORELAI,"Well, I believe three minutes is plenty of time for some coffee.",3
RORY,"Yes, coffee, please.",3
LORELAI,"Hey, we're dying, load us up.",3
LUKE,It isn't ready yet.,3
LORELAI,What?,3
RORY,Mommy.,3
LORELAI,What do you mean it's not ready? It's six in the morning. Nothing says coffee like six in the morning.,3
LUKE,You did not get this from me.,3
LORELAI,Then who do we send our kisses of gratitude to?,3
LUKE,The eternal question asked yet again.,3
RORY,Thanks Luke. Strong.,3
LORELAI,Yeah? Hello.,3
TAYLORory,"All right, folks. Everybody on the floor. We're two minutes away. I repeat, everybody on the floor, we are two minutes away.",3
KIRK,Lorelai.,3
LORELAI,Kirk.,3
KIRK,Good luck to you.,3
LORELAI,And to you.,3
LORELAI,He's going down.,3
RORY,I hate to bring this up.,3
LORELAI,What?,3
RORY,Kirk has very little in his life.,3
LORELAI,Uh huh.,3
RORY,"He has no career, no girlfriend, no pet, no car. He lives with his mother, she won't even let him have his own key. The only thing he does have in his whole lonely pathetic existence is this marathon. If we win, if we take him down, if we take away that last little piece of dignity, then we leave him with nothing.",3
LORELAI,I wonder if he'll cry.,3
RORY,"My mother, the Howard Roark of Stars Hollow.",3
TAYLORory,"All right, everybody, grab your partners, make sure your numbers are securely fastened,and let the countdown begin!",3
EVERYONE,"Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!",3
TAYLORory,It's showtime!,3
BABETTE,"I'm done, let's go.",3
MOREY,,3
LORELAI,"Hey Kirk, relax. Dancing's supposed to be fun.",3
KIRK,"You know what will be fun, Lorelai? Jogging around your prostrate body with that shiny temple of silver importance hoisted in the air for all to see. That will be fun.",3
LORELAI,Do you think serious Kirk is more disturbing than non-serious Kirk?,3
RORY,"Actually, I think they're both about the same.",3
LORELAI,Come on.,3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,Follow me.,3
DEAN,"Wow, you guys look great.",3
RORY,"Hey, you came.",3
DEAN,"Hey, you're standing.",3
LORELAI,"Hey, we had coffee.",3
DEAN,"I can tell. So, how's it going?",3
RORY,"Oh, it's been pretty quiet so far. However, I do believe  ",3
ANDREW,You went out with Liam Neeson! Are you kidding me?,3
LORELAI,Right on time!,3
ANDREW,Why would you ever tell me that you went out with Liam Neeson? Why would you do that?,3
WOMAN,Because I was trying to be honest.,3
ANDREW,"I don't believe that A, you actually went out with Liam Neeson, and B, that you would choose to tell me now at this moment that you went out with Liam Neeson!",3
WOMAN,Andrew!,3
ANDREW,No!,3
WOMAN,Andrew!,3
ANDREW,I can't stand Liam Neeson!,3
RORY,"See, fun!",3
LORELAI,And no one's even thrown up yet.,3
DEAN,"Okay, well, uh, I'm just gonna go sit over there and watch for awhile. Maybe I'll get lucky.",3
RORY,Great.,3
LORELAI,"Well, that's sweet. Spectator Ken.",3
RORY,"Just keep dancing, you.",3
LORELAI,"Flip all you want, pal. This ain't the Olympics. It's who's left standing at the end that matters, not how fancy you are getting there.",3
LORELAI,Let me flip you.,3
RORY,No way.,3
LORELAI,Come on!,3
RORY,You are not flipping me.,3
LORELAI,Fine.,3
RORY,Fine.,3
LORELAI,You flip me.,3
RORY,"No need, you've already flipped.",3
LORELAI,One cartwheel.,3
RORY,Silence.,3
TAYLORory,Unauthorized persons on the dance floor. Unauthorized persons on the dance floor. Security! Security! Security!,3
LORELAI,"Well, look who's suddenly interested in dance.",3
RORY,,3
LORELAI,Kirk.,3
RORY,Mm?,3
RORY,How much longer?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, chin up soldier. We should be getting a break pretty soon.",3
RORY,I hope so.,3
JACKSON,"Oh good, there she is.",3
SOOKIE,"Jackson, please.",3
LORELAI,Hey guys.,3
JACKSON,"Well, hey to you, too. Listen, I wanted to ask you, what do you think of my hair?",3
LORELAI,What?,3
JACKSON,My hair. How's it look to you? Any opinion?,3
LORELAI,It looks fine.,3
SOOKIE,"Jackson, you're overacting.",3
JACKSON,"You think? How  bout you, Lorelai? You think I'm overreacting?",3
LORELAI,"Jackson, what?",3
LORELAI,Oh my God.,3
RORY,"What, what?",3
LORELAI,The runaround.,3
RORY,The runaround? That does not sound good.,3
LORELAI,"I'm sorry, baby. I'm so, so sorry.",3
TAYLORory,"Ladies and Gentlemen, on your marks. . .get set. . .and go!",3
TAYLORory,,3
PATTY,"You're getting too much pleasure out of this, Taylor.",3
JACKSON,"Hey Lorelai, just wondering, how's my running? Got an opinion on that?",3
LORELAI,"Jackson, what's going on?",3
SOOKIE,Nothing. He's mad at me an d he's taking it out on you.,3
JACKSON,"Oh, I'm not mad. I just didn't realize that when I married Sookie, I also married you. I didn't realize I was a Mormon, my mistake.",3
RORY,I need to interject for one second to tell you that I hate you!,3
LORELAI,"Thanks, honey.",3
SOOKIE,Quit trying to drag Lorelai into this.,3
JACKSON,"Fine, I will.",3
SOOKIE,"Jackson, wait! Yellow cards, right here! I've got them for the both of us. We'll be right back!",3
TAYLORory,One of you is supposed to stay here. Hey!,3
RORY,I think I'm going to die.,3
LORELAI,Me first.,3
RORY,How much longer?,3
LORELAI,I don't know. I just know that every year I block this part out.,3
RORY,From now on I'm going to remind you of it.,3
LORELAI,"Kirk, what are you doing?",3
KIRK,I'm drafting you.,3
LORELAI,"Well, stop it!",3
KIRK,You can't tell me w here to run!,3
LORELAI,"Kirk, I swear to God, don't make me come back there!",3
TAYLORory,"Ten minute break everyone, ten minute break. Well run. Ten minute break, everyone. Ten minute break.",3
LORELAI,What are you doing?,3
RORY,I'm trying to kick you but I can't reach.,3
LORELAI,I would help you but I can't move.,3
RORY,Can I owe you one?,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, no problem. Okay, okay, heart returning to normal. I have to go find Jackson and Sookie.",3
RORY,I'll get us a couple of sandwiches.,3
LORELAI,"Good idea. This is fun, huh?",3
RORY,,3
JESS,"So, not dancing?",3
LANE,Nope.,3
JESS,Why not? Too cool?,3
LANE,"Go away, Jess. No one asked for a Tony Manero wannabe to drop by.",3
JESS,"Hey, I'm just here for the food.",3
LANE,"Here, enjoy, buh-bye.",3
JESS,I noticed Rory's not dancing with Dean.,3
LANE,"Nothing gets past you, does it.",3
JESS,How come? Trouble in paradise?,3
LANE,"Rory's dancing with her mother. Nothing's wrong with her and Dean, and you're blocking my sandwiches from the rest of the room.",3
JESS,,3
KIM,Who are you?,3
JESS,,3
KIM,Scoop more.,3
RORY,The sandwiches are for the dancers.,3
JESS,I'm dancing on the inside.,3
RORY,What are you doing here?,3
JESS,I live here.,3
RORY,You have nothing better to do than to sit around inside a gymnasium all day staring at a dance marathon?,3
JESS,I don't know. Do you have nothing better to do than sit inside a gymnasium all day staring at a dance marathon?,3
DEAN,I wouldn't direct any sort of comment toward me if I were you.,3
JESS,I'm just trying to support my town.,3
RORY,"Good, then go back to New York.",3
JESS,Ooh. Zing. I've been snapped.,3
RORY,You think you're bugging me sitting in front of me staring like that?,3
JESS,You think you're bugging me dancing in front of me staring like that?,3
RORY,I'm not staring at you.,3
JESS,Then how do you know I'm staring at you?,3
RORY,"I am dancing. I cannot control where my glance goes. And the few moments that I can control it, my glance goes to Dean, not to you.",3
JESS,"So you can't control when you look at me, but you have to force yourself to look at him? Sorry, man. That's cold.",3
DEAN,My former commen t still stands.,3
RORY,Go home.,3
JESS,"No, thanks.",3
RORY,Then get out of my way.,3
JESS,Didn't realize I was in your way. There you go. It's all yours. God help you.,3
SHANE,Where did you go? I've been sitting out there for twenty minutes.,3
JESS,The break's only for ten.,3
SHANE,It's just a saying.,3
JESS,I came to get food.,3
SHANE,"Good, I'm starved.",3
RORY,The food is for the dancers.,3
SHANE,"Who are you, Bobby Brady? Get a life.",3
JESS,Rory's feeling a little territorial today.,3
SHANE,"Whatever. God, what is this thing?",3
DEAN,"Rory, get your stuff and let's go.",3
JESS,"Ooh, that was good. Now say  then get in there and make me my supper.'",3
RORY,I got them.,3
DEAN,Come on.,3
JESS,,3
LORELAI,Have you seen Sookie and Jackson?,3
LUKE,Nope.,3
LORELAI,I've looked everywhere for them.,3
LUKE,Have you tried the insane asylum where everybody in this room is supposed to be?,3
JACKSON,"Okay, I need to say something here.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, I've been looking all over for you.",3
SOOKIE,I wish you would just drop this.,3
JACKSON,"Contrary to your belief, there are some things in life that you do not have the right to have an opinion on.",3
LORELAI,What?,3
JACKSON,And the rate at which I have kids and the amount of kids I wish to have falls directly under that category,3
LORELAI,"Sookie, what did you tell him?",3
SOOKIE,"Okay, you see, once again, my communication skills   not so good.",3
LORELAI,"Jackson, I didn't mean to get involved in any of this.",3
JACKSON,No? Telling Sookie that she needs to immediately inform me that four in four is crazy?,3
LORELAI,"Aw, Sookie.",3
SOOKIE,"Yeah, it did come out something like that.",3
LORELAI,Aw man.,3
LUKE,What's four in four?,3
LORELAI,Four kids in four years.,3
LUKE,That is crazy.,3
JACKSON,"Oh good, yes, let's open this up to even more discussion.",3
LUKE,One kid in four years is crazy.,3
JACKSON,Hey.,3
LUKE,"Sorry, go ahead, drop another sucker in this mess.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, raise your hand if you're not helping.",3
JACKSON,Does anyone here understand that a man has a right not to have his personal life debated in a public forum? I am not Winona Ryder.,3
SOOKIE,"Well, I know that.",3
LORELAI,"I'm sorry, Jackson, I didn't mean  ",3
JACKSON,My child-bearing arrangements are between me and Sookie.,3
LUKE,And the Lord. Still not helping?,3
SOOKIE,"Jackson, just please calm down.",3
JACKSON,I will calm down. I'll calm down at home.,3
SOOKIE,But what about the contest?,3
JACKSON,"To hell with the contest! I'm quitting the contest. That is, if it's okay with Lorelai, or Luke, or that strange man in the corner who I've never met. Excuse me, strange man in the corner? Is it okay if I quit this contest?",3
SOOKIE,I'm so sorry. I got tongue-tied and things just started coming out and I couldn't stop them and. . .,3
LORELAI,Go.,3
SOOKIE,"Jackson, honey, wait!",3
LUKE,"Oh, they're gonna make great parents.",3

RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,My heel broke.,3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,"My heel just broke off. Damn, these are brand new shoes, too.",3
RORY,They were made in 1943.,3
LORELAI,"Well, I just bought them Tuesday.",3
RORY,I told you not to wear vintage shoes.,3
LORELAI,But the lady at the store said that they hadn't been worn a lot.,3
RORY,"Yeah, but not a lot in sixty years is still a lot.",3
LORELAI,I gotta fix them. I'll use my emergency card. I'll be right back.,3
RORY,"No, stop. If you leave, there's no way I'll be able to stand up on my own.",3

LORELAI,"I need you, Dean. The team needs you.",3
DEAN,What team?,3
LORELAI,Pick a team   it needs you. I'll be right back.,3
RORY,I'm really sorry about this.,3
DEAN,"Yeah, uh, it's okay.",3
RORY,Are you sure?,3
DEAN,"Yeah. Actually, it's not bad at all.",3
LUKE,"I think that one's a goner, Miss.",3
LORELAI,"Hey, my shoe broke.",3
LUKE,What?,3
LORELAI,I need you to fix it.,3
LUKE,Do I look like a cobbler to you?,3
LORELAI,"If I say yes, will you fix my shoe?",3
LUKE,Let me see it.,3
LORELAI,I only have ten minutes   please.,3
LUKE,I think I have some glue back at the diner.,3
LORELAI,"Glue, yes   we love glue!",3
LUKE,I wouldn't say that too loudly if I were you.,3
LORELAI,Thank you.,3
SOOKIE,Hey. Are you guys out?,3
LORELAI,"No, my shoe broke. Luke's fixing it.",3
SOOKIE,"Oh, good. Listen, I just feel terrible about what happened.",3
LORELAI,I know. How's Jackson?,3
SOOKIE,"Oh, he's fine. We went home, and he calmed down, and we talked. He totally understands and he's open to anything I want.",3
LORELAI,That's great.,3
SOOKIE,"Now, tell me w hat I want.",3
LORELAI,No way.,3
SOOKIE,But I'm not sure.,3
LORELAI,Then flip a coin  cause I am staying so far out of this.,3
SOOKIE,You're my best friend.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, I am, and I can only remain your best friend as long as Jackson doesn't k*ll me.",3
SOOKIE,Lorelai. . .,3
LORELAI,"Sookie, he's a produce man. They'll never find the body, but the squash will be especially chatty that year.",3
SOOKIE,"Okay, fair enough.",3
LORELAI,"Hey, take your time. That's it. That's all I have to say.",3
SOOKIE,Thank you.,3
LUKE,Got it.,3
LORELAI,"Ah, good.",3
SOOKIE,"Well, I'm going home to figure out what I want. Good luck. Call me tomorrow.",3
LORELAI,I will.,3
LUKE,"So, how's that situation going?",3
LORELAI,"Oh, it'll be okay.",3
LUKE,"Good. Uh, listen, uh, I didn't really mean all that stuff I said earlier.",3
LORELAI,What stuff?,3
LUKE,"Uh, the kid stuff, you know.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, it's no big deal.",3
LUKE,"Yeah, I know, I just. . .I'm not really as anti-kid as I might have come off.",3
LORELAI,Drop another sucker in. . .,3
LUKE,"Okay, yes. I don't always have the patience for them. They tend to be a little squishy, and that freaks me out a little.",3
LORELAI,"You don't have to want kids, Luke. Or like kids. It's not for everybody.",3
LUKE,"I know, but. . .although I'm quite happy going an entire day without having to deal with somebody else's bodily functions, if I ever happen to meet the right person. . .well, it would be a discussion.",3
LORELAI,A discussion.,3
LUKE,"Yes. Probably a short discussion, but still. Here, hold this. So what about you   you ever think about having another kid?",3
LORELAI,"Oh, I don't know how much fun it would be without biology finals and headgear. . . but sure, if I ever happen to meet the right person, another kid might be nice.",3
LUKE,Your shoe'll be ready in a minute,3

DAVE,One sandwich please.,3
LANE,Hi.,3
DAVE,Hi.,3
LANE,What are you doing here?,3
DAVE,"Uh, well, you mentioned this thing last time we talked and it sounded very Blue Velvet so I figured I would come by and check it out.",3
LANE,What do you think?,3
DAVE,"Uh, I think you held back.",3
LANE,"Yeah, well. . .",3
DAVE,"Anyhow, I hadn't seen you in awhile, and I thought I'd come down and maybe we could figure something out on this band issue.",3
LANE,"Sure, we could do that.",3
DAVE,"Plus, I missed you.",3
LANE,You did? You missed me?,3
DAVE,"Well, yeah. Did you miss me?",3

KIM,"Who are you, what do you want?",3
LANE,,3
KIM,Do you know this boy?,3
LANE,Well  ,3
DAVE,"Uh, no, actually, I just heard a bunch of people talking outside about the sandwiches and I thought that I would come in and maybe try one. I'm sorry, may I? Thank you. That's delicious.",3
LANE,Really?,3
DAVE,,3
KIM,"Yes, that's fine. Take another one.",3
DAVE,,3
KIM,Bible study?,3
DAVE,,3
KIM,Why?,3
DAVE,,3

RORY,He's still there.,3
DEAN,What?,3
RORY,Jess. He's still there. I can't believe he's still there.,3
DEAN,Just ignore him.,3
RORY,"Yeah. You know, this is a dance marathon. You're not supposed to come and sit and watch, you're supposed to dance. He's just trying to bug me, sitting there right in front of me, staring. Jerk.",3
SHANE,I'm bored.,3
JESS,Okay.,3
RORY,"There they go again! God, I swear, why can't they just get a room? Or forget a room   get a park bench, or a doorway, or even a strategically placed telephone pole would probably suffice. I mean, girls like Shane   what is it with them? Don't they see what they look like? I know they have mirrors.",3
JESS,"Hey, you talking about me?",3
RORY,No.,3
JESS,I heard you mention Shane.,3
RORY,Shane isn't you.,3
JESS,Shane concerns me.,3
RORY,"Shane concerns me, too   and all women, for that matter.",3
JESS,You got a problem here?,3
RORY,"Nope. Just a little sick of seeing the two of you sitting there. If you're not gonna participate, then why don't you just leave?",3
SHANE,That works for me. Let's go.,3
JESS,No.,3
RORY,Why not?,3
JESS,Because I'm not ready to go.,3
RORY,Oh really?,3
JESS,"Yes, really. I'm gonna sit here as long as I like, and I'm gonna do whatever I like, and if you don't like it, then just ignore me an d pay attention to your boyfriend.",3
DEAN,"Sorry, she can't. I'm not her boyfriend anymore.",3
RORY,What?,3
DEAN,"You know, I tried to ignore this. I really did, but I don't know what the hell I was thinking.",3
RORY,What are you talking about?,3
DEAN,"You don't wanna be with me, Rory.",3
RORY,"Yes, I do.",3
DEAN,"Oh, please! You've been into him since he got to town, and I have spent weeks   months, actually   trying to convince myself that it wasn't true, that everything was fine between us. But now I know that I was an idiot. You're into him and he's into you, and Shane, who by the way, should be listening to this  cause it's so damn obvious.",3
RORY,What's obvious? What did I do?,3
DEAN,"Everyone can see, Rory! Everyone. And I'm tired, but I'm over it, so go ahead, go. Be together. There's nothing standing in your way now,  cause I'm out.",3
TAYLORory,,3
PATTY,,3
JESS,"Dean's a jerk. Yelling at you like that, breaking up in front of everybody. . .the guy's a total jerk.",3
RORY,"No, he's not. He's right. Everything he said. All those things about you and me, all those things about me lying to him, and messing with his head. He was right. Well, wasn't he? Fine, he was right about me, then. Now go away.",3
JESS,He was right. . . about all of it.,3
RORY,"So, what now?",3
JESS,You're definitely broken up with Dean?,3

RORY,How are you?,3
LORELAI,I should probably keep moving.,3
RORY,"God, my feet have never been in this much pain before.",3
LORELAI,"Oh yeah, what about that time?",3
RORY,What time?,3
LORELAI,The time w hen I did the thing and your feet were . . .gotta stop.,3
RORY,Gotta sit.,3
RORY,Ugh. What were you saying?,3
LORELAI,About what?,3
RORY,About my feet.,3
LORELAI,What about your feet?,3
RORY,I don't know. You were talking about the thing you did to my feet.,3
LORELAI,What thing?,3
RORY,The thing that you. . .you and. . .huh?,3
LORELAI,What?,3
Posted,11/30/02 21:35,3
RORY,I don't know.,3
LORELAI,Just an observation   you and I do not function well on a funky sleeping pattern.,3
RORY,I feel jet-lagged.,3
LORELAI,You've been up twenty-four hours straight.,3
RORY,"Yes, why did I do that?",3
LORELAI,Because I asked you to.,3
RORY,And that worked?,3
LORELAI,At the time. I don't expect it to again.,3
RORY,"A realist, I like that.",3
LORELAI,How far is Luke's?,3
RORY,It's right over there.,3
LORELAI,It looks far.,3
RORY,Very far.,3
LORELAI,"Maybe if we concentrate really hard, our combined psychic powers will move it closer.",3
RORY,I don't think it's working.,3
LORELAI,"It's my fault, I'm not focusing.",3
RORY,"Yes, that must be why we can't move a half a city block closer to us.",3
LORELAI,,3
LORELAI,Oh my God. Thank you.,3
RORY,I never realized Luke's was a hundred miles away.,3
LORELAI,"We're lucky it wasn't snowing. It would've been The Donner Party all over again, but with slightly better hair. Why are you sitting over there?",3
RORY,Where?,3
LORELAI,At that table.,3
RORY,Huh. How did I get here?,3
LORELAI,You sat there.,3
RORY,"Well, this chair's very close to that chair, so you understand how I could've made the mistake.",3
LORELAI,Move over here with me.,3
RORY,Why don't you move over here with me?,3
LORELAI,Because I'm not the one who sat in the wrong chair.,3
RORY,I think it's a little presumptuous to assume that my chair is the wrong chair when my chair could just as easily be the right chair.,3
LORELAI,No.,3
RORY,Why?,3
LORELAI,"Because I'm the leader of the clan, the provider of the household, the alpha male, and the one whose feet just fell asleep so there's absolutely no chance of movement.",3
RORY,Fine.,3
LORELAI,"Thank you. See, it's nice sitting at the grown-up table, isn't it?",3
RORY,Uh huh.,3
KIRK,"Oh, excuse me, did my trophy bump you?",3
LORELAI,"No, Kirk, it didn't.",3
KIRK,"Good, because the size of it is so large that sometimes I can't judge where the exact end of it is.",3
LORELAI,"We're fine, Kirk.",3
KIRK,"I'm glad, because these shiny golden edges are actually very sharp. They could take an eye out or cause a deep gash completely unintentionally.",3
LORELAI,Uh huh.,3
KIRK,It's almost more a w*apon than a trophy.,3
LORELAI,"Really? Can I hold it, then?",3
LUKE,"Get out of the way, Kirk. You're blocking the door.",3
KIRK,"Luke, I'll be needing one of your larger tables this morning, since your smaller tables simply cannot accommodate the sheer size of my massive trophy.",3
LUKE,Put it on the floor.,3
KIRK,It needs its own chair.,3
LUKE,It's gonna need some glue if you don't sit down pretty soon.,3
KIRK,Everybody hates a winner.,3
LORELAI,"Hey, how  bout one person gets pancakes and one person gets eggs and then we can share?",3
RORY,"I can't, I have to go.",3
LORELAI,What are you talking about? It's  ,3
LORELAI,It took us thirty minutes to get here?,3
RORY,Lots of limping.,3
LORELAI,"Wow, sh**t. Well, at least grab a donut before you go. Hey, unh, Luke, uh, we need a couple of donuts, and, uh, some of those extra legs Heather Mills is sending over to Croatia.",3
LUKE,Coming right up.,3
JESS,Hi.,3
RORY,Hey.,3
JESS,Hi.,3
LORELAI,Hi.,3
JESS,Hi.,3
LUKE,Hi.,3
RORY,I have to get to school.,3
JESS,"Yeah, me too.",3
RORY,Bye,3
JESS,Bye. Bye.,3
LORELAI,Bye.,3
RORY,Bye.,3
LORELAI,Bye.,3
RORY,Bye.,3
LUKE,Bye.,3
LUKE,What the hell was that?,3
LORELAI,That was episode one of Rory and,3
Jess,The Early Years.,3
LUKE,What?,3
LORELAI,Rory and Jess are together.,3
LUKE,Are you serious? What about Dean?,3
LORELAI,Dean and Rory broke up at the dance.,3
LUKE,"They did? I was at the dance, how come I didn't know about this?",3
LORELAI,Because you're you.,3
LUKE,"But why, what happened?",3
LORELAI,Jess happened.,3
LUKE,"Wow, wow. So. . .",3
LORELAI,Yup.,3
LUKE,"Wow. Well, this is great.",3
LORELAI,I'll tell Dean you said that.,3
LUKE,"You know what I mean, Rory and Jess, Jess and Rory. I think this is great. Don't you think this is great?",3
LORELAI,I think Rory's seventeen and it's probably about time for a Jess.,3
LUKE,"Look, I know Jess is a little tough sometimes, but he likes Rory and Rory's a good kid, hopefully she'll rub off on him.",3
LORELAI,"You know what, I've spent a lot of time and energy fighting the whole Jess thing. Rory's made her choice, I want her to be happy. I'm just hoping for the best at this point.",3
LUKE,Very romantic.,3
LORELAI,"Says the man who yelled ""Finally!"" at the end of Love Story.",3
LUKE,I'll get you coffee.,3

EMILY,"Do it again, please! I'm not quite sure what other way there is to say  no walnuts in the salad' except to say  no walnuts in the salad.'",3
LORELAI,"Mom, she just made a mistake.",3
EMILY,"She doesn't listen, she doesn't care, she has no work ethic.",3
LORELAI,She has some w ork ethic. You made her remake the salad four times.,3
EMILY,I like things done correctly.,3
RICHARD,Preferably the first time.,3
EMILY,"Thank you, Richard.",3
LORELAI,"You know, Mom, in Europe, they eat the salad last and the main course first.",3
EMILY,We're not in Europe.,3
LORELAI,We could pretend.,3
EMILY,"Really, Lorelai, you can't wait ten minutes for another salad? The situation's that dire?",3
LORELAI,"Four salads ago, no, not dire. Right now it's  your money for nothing and your chicks for free.'",3
EMILY,Rory?,3
RORY,She didn't have lunch.,3
EMILY,Fine.,3
RICHARD,Where are you going?,3
EMILY,"Apparently, we're going to be European tonight.",3
RICHARD,"Oh, wonderful. I was getting so tired of being American day after day after day.",3
LORELAI,"God, I'm starved.",3
RORY,Think about something else.,3
LORELAI,Like what?,3
RORY,Something disgusting that will take your appetite away.,3
LORELAI,Ari Fleischer?,3
RICHARD,"Ari Fleischer is our nation's mouthpiece, young lady.",3
LORELAI,Officially not hungry now.,3
EMILY,"Liliana will be right out with the sand dabs. I'm afraid we're going to have to let her go, Richard.",3
RICHARD,"Oh, if that's how you feel, Emily.",3
LORELAI,You're firing someone over putting walnuts in a salad?,3
EMILY,I'm going to fire someone over putting walnuts in the salad after she was told not to put walnuts in the salad.,3
LORELAI,"Mom, you know, if you're not a little nicer to your help, you might find yourself in a Frank Lloyd Wright situation.",3
RICHARD,Frank Lloyd Wright?,3
EMILY,What on earth does Frank Lloyd Wright have to do with my salad?,3
RICHARD,And your walnuts.,3
LORELAI,"Mrs. Wright apparently had this major problem with her help. She was very rough on them and they totally hated her. So this guy who had worked for her forever, he had finally had enough. I believe the incident was over walnuts, wasn't it, honey?",3
RORY,The exact cause has not been proven.,3
LORELAI,"Anyhow, Mrs. Wright invites this whole posse of people over for dinner and they're all sitting around eating, and Mr. Disgruntled Servant Guy goes outside and locks all the doors and windows and douses the whole house in gasoline and sets the place on fire.",3
EMILY,My goodness.,3
LORELAI,"So the house is on fire, and people are freaking out, so they run to the doors but the doors are locked, so a few of them try to get out through the windows, but Mr. Angry-Puss is standing outside with an ax hacking them to death and so they all died.",3
EMILY,Why on earth would you tell me that story?,3
LORELAI,All I'm saying is sometimes eating a walnut is preferable to getting hacked to death or set on fire during dinner.,3
EMILY,One of these days I'm going to make you eat in your room.,3
RORY,I'm going to go get myself another soda. Would anyone else like something?,3
LORELAI,"I'd like a big bag of walnuts, and make sure you tell her they're for me.",3
RICHARD,"I believe I need a little more ice. Emily, are you fine?",3
EMILY,"Yes, Richard, I'm fine, thank you.",3
EMILY,,3
RICHARD,Did you find it?,3
RORY,"Yes, I did.",3
RICHARD,"Good, good. Ah, here we are, ice. And. . .chocolates.",3
RORY,Bless you.,3
RICHARD,"So, tell me, how's it going at school?",3
RORY,It's good. It's crazy.,3
RICHARD,Senior year.,3
RORY,Yup.,3
RICHARD,Preparing for college can be a daunting task. I remember when I was preparing for Yale.,3
RORY,Bad?,3
RICHARD,I don't believe I slept the entire year. I didn't even cut my hair for two months.,3
RORY,Grandpa!,3
RICHARD,"Oh, yes, it was quite a scandal. But in the end, it was all worth it.",3
RORY,Yeah?,3
RICHARD,"My years at Yale were absolutely the most gratifying ones of my life. Just the sheer freedom of knowing that anything I wanted to learn, I could learn right there. Plus, the history of the place, the heritage. . .my father went to Yale.",3
RORY,I know.,3
RICHARD,I also made wonderful friends there. Friends I still have today.,3
RORY,That must be nice.,3
RICHARD,I'm going to be going back there next week. There's going to be a little reunion of the Whiffenpoofs.,3
RORY,"I'm sorry, the what?",3
RICHARD,It's an a cappella singing group I belonged to at Yale.,3
RORY,A singing group?,3
RICHARD,"A very famous singing group, actually. Like the Beatles, but with better table manners.",3
RORY,I've never heard you sing.,3
RICHARD,"Well, I'm no Perry Como, but my shower hasn't kicked me out yet. Anyway, a group of us are going to get together at the old alma mater and have a little dinner, swap some w*r stories.",3
RORY,Sounds fun.,3
MAID,Excuse me.,3
RORY,"Uh, did you see what I just saw?",3
RICHARD,Walnuts.,3
RORY,Poor Grandma.,3
RICHARD,"Poor us. You know, you might wanna come with me next week.",3
RORY,Come w ith you where?,3
RICHARD,To Yale.,3
RORY,What?,3
RICHARD,"Oh, I don't mean to the dinner, that would be boring for you, but you might enjoy seeing the school.",3
RORY,Well  ,3
RICHARD,Your mother could come to. It would be a fun little adventure.,3
RORY,Wow.,3
RICHARD,"We could drive down, have a little roadside snack, get there about noon. Have a little tour, and then the two of you girls could go off and have fun, and the old folks can have a somber little dinner. I think you'd love to see it. I certainly would love to show it to you.",3
RORY,"Well. . .sure, Grandpa. That would be nice.",3
RICHARD,"Wonderful. Oh, I'm thrilled. Uh, do you wanna tell your mother or shall I?",3
RORY,"Oh, you know what, I can tell her.",3
RICHARD,"All right, you tell her. Looks like we're gonna need a few more of these.",3
RORY,,3
LORELAI,"Okay, I officially vote that we send my mother an anonymous note requesting that she never make us the sand dabs again.",3
RORY,I'm not sure how anonymous it would be considering she said we were the first people she ever made them for.,3
RORY,I have to tell you something.,3
LORELAI,Okay.,3
RORY,Grandpa talked to me tonight.,3
RORY,Why'd you turn the car off?,3
LORELAI,I'm just getting the sense that I shouldn't be driving a large vehicle when you tell me this.,3
RORY,It's no big deal.,3
LORELAI,Uh huh.,3
RORY,It's not.,3
LORELAI,Then tell me.,3
RORY,"Okay. Um, well, Grandpa was mentioning that he and Grandma are going on a trip next week, a driving trip somewhere, and he invited me to go. And you. He invited you and me to go on a trip with him and Grandma.",3
LORELAI,Where?,3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,Where's the driving trip to?,3
RORY,Yale.,3
RORY,"Mom? Mom, wait.",3
LORELAI,"No, it's okay, I got it.",3
RORY,"He's going for some nostalgia thing. For a reunion of, I don't know, the Whiffenhoofs.",3
LORELAI,Poofs.,3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,Whiffenpoofs.,3
RORY,Not much better.,3
LORELAI,I totally agree.,3
RORY,"Well, he got all sentimental and he really just wants to show me the campus. It's no big deal.",3
LORELAI,It's a huge deal.,3
RORY,Mom.,3
LORELAI,"There's a reason he wants to drag you out there, Rory. He's manipulating you. Trust me, I know, he's a master at it.",3
RORY,"Okay, fine, maybe he is, but he really wants me to go, I can tell. And you don't have to go. I mean, he invited you and I would really love it if you could come, but really, you can stay home. Just please don't make a big thing out of this. This doesn't have to be a fight.",3
LORELAI,Rory.,3
RORY,"We go. We look. Hi Yale. Bye Yale. It's over. No harm, no foul.",3
LORELAI,How many more two-word sentences can you come up with?,3
RORY,"You know, it doesn't have to be a total loss.",3
LORELAI,"Look, as she's leading me back to the car.",3
RORY,"I'm sure you and I can figure out a fun thing to do while they're off at dinner, some cool road trip thing.",3
LORELAI,In New Haven?,3
RORY,"Well, yeah.",3
LORELAI,"Sweetie, have you ever been to New Haven?",3
RORY,No.,3
LORELAI,"Take a look at the coffee pot tomorrow before I clean it, that's New Haven.",3
RORY,"We can make it fun. It would mean a lot to the grandparents, everybody wins.",3
LORELAI,"Rory, listen to me.",3
RORY,"I know, I am being manipulated. This is part of Grandpa's evil plan to take over my life, abolish my free will, pull me in into the Gilmore world, dress me in pearls, and ruin my life. Did I leave anything out?",3
LORELAI,"Mm, let me see. . . manipulate, evil plan, no free will, pearls   no, I think you about covered it. Oh, wait   did you call my father the Puppet Master?",3
RORY,"No, I did not.",3
LORELAI,Always call him the Puppet Master.,3
RORY,,3
KIRK,"Luke, where's your lost and found?",3
LUKE,Out back in the dumpster.,3
KIRK,I need your help. I don't know what to do. I'm shaking like a spastic colon.,3
LUKE,"What's the matter, Kirk?",3
KIRK,My trophy's gone.,3
LUKE,What?,3
KIRK,Someone took her.,3
LUKE,Kirk.,3
KIRK,"The last time I rememb er seeing her, she was next to me at the movies.",3
LUKE,Stop calling it she.,3
KIRK,I retraced my steps all day and nothing. I suspect foul play.,3
LUKE,Foul play?,3
KIRK,"Kidnapping, possibly.",3
LUKE,"Well, then, I think you should go to the police, and if they mention something about staying somewhere for observation, it's just routine.",3
RORY,Hey Kirk.,3
KIRK,Rory.,3
RORY,What are you doing?,3
KIRK,Where were you this morning at about ten?,3
RORY,At school.,3
KIRK,Do you have any witnesses?,3
RORY,Yes.,3
KIRK,Can you get them to make a short statement?,3
RORY,No.,3
KIRK,"Oh, well, okay.",3
RORY,Someone took his statue again.,3
LUKE,"Yeah, yeah.",3
RORY,Every year.,3
LUKE,"Well, there's some things in life that never let you down. So. . .",3
RORY,So. . .,3
LUKE,"It's nice to see you, Rory.",3
RORY,"It's nice to see you, too, Luke.",3
LUKE,"So, table for one?",3
RORY,"Um, I'll just sit at the counter.",3
LUKE,Okay. What can I get you?,3
RORY,"Um, I guess I'll have a cheeseburger.",3
LUKE,"Hey Jess, look who's here   Rory.",3
JESS,Hi.,3
RORY,Hi.,3
LUKE,"Okay, time to add another word. Jess, you want something to eat?",3
JESS,I'm not hungry.,3
RORY,"Oh, yeah, I'm not hungry either.",3
LUKE,What about the burger?,3
RORY,"Oh, well. . .could you wrap it up? I'm gonna eat it later. I actually prefer burgers after they've been sitting around for awhile. Let's them age.",3
LUKE,Okay.,3
JESS,"You know, I've got that book upstairs.",3
RORY,"Oh, the book we talked about?",3
JESS,Yup.,3
RORY,Great.,3
JESS,We could go upstairs and look at it.,3
RORY,"Look at the book, sure. Let's go upstairs and look at the book.",3
JESS,Okay.,3
RORY,,3
JESS,"So, here we are.",3
RORY,"Yup, here we are. Wow, I haven't seen it since you guys redid it.",3
JESS,Oh yeah.,3
RORY,It's bigger.,3
JESS,Ripping a wall down can have that effect on a,3
roomRORY,"Yeah. That part, over there.",3
JESS,That's mine.,3
RORY,Yeah.,3
JESS,Yeah. You want a soda?,3
RORY,"No, I'm fine.",3
JESS,Okay. You sure you don't want a soda?,3
RORY,"Yeah, I'm sure.",3
JESS,Please let me get you a soda. I gotta do something other than stand here like a moron.,3
RORY,Take comfort in the fact that you are not doing it alone.,3
JESS,"Okay, let's just regroup here.",3
RORY,"Yeah, regroup.",3
JESS,"First of all, we should try to get within, say, a foot of each other.",3
RORY,Okay. I think that's about a foot.,3
JESS,"Huh, that school of yours is really paying off.",3
RORY,"So, now what?",3
JESS,Now we should. . .,3
RORY,"Well, I think we either need to get a little closer or need to warm up.",3
JESS,Okay. Hi.,3
RORY,Hi.,3
LUKE,I got the burger.,3
RORY,Thank you.,3
LUKE,I also threw in some fries.,3
RORY,"Fries, great. I love fries. Okay, um, Jess, thank you for. . .um, your. . .um   I gotta go.",3
LUKE,What was going on up here?,3
JESS,Nothing.,3
LUKE,Nothing? I walk in here and the two of you are like shrapnel.,3
JESS,"Your timing is perfect, by the way. Next time I'll hang a sock on the door.",3
LUKE,"Hey, there will be no hanging of socks on the door in my house, do you hear me?",3
JESS,"Relax, I was kidding.",3
LUKE,"Oh, really? Hanging socks on doors   that's your idea of funny.",3
JESS,"Depending on the sock design, could be hilarious.",3
LUKE,"Okay, that's it, sit down.",3
JESS,Why?,3
LUKE,"It's time to lay down a few ground rules, sit. All right, first off, when she is up here, that door stays open.",3
JESS,Excuse me?,3
LUKE,"You are not allowed on either end of this apartment. You are, instead, to remain here in the middle portion of the room. You may sit on the couch or on the chair, as long as you two are sitting on separate seats, i.e. when you're on the couch, then she's on the chair. When she's on the couch, then you're on the chair.",3
JESS,"I get it, thank you.",3
LUKE,"On weekdays, you will have her home by nine. On weekends, you will have her home by eleven. Any evidence of alcohol, cigarette smoke, or anything else that Nancy Reagan would find unacceptable and you will not be allowed near her without an adult present. Are these rules clear?",3
JESS,Yes.,3
LUKE,Good.,3
JESS,May I speak?,3
LUKE,If you must.,3
JESS,Do you want me to have you committed or would you prefer to check yourself in?,3
LUKE,"I'm not joking here, mister.",3
JESS,"You know you're my guardian, not hers, right?",3
LUKE,You don't need a guardian.,3
JESS,She tried to kiss me.,3
LUKE,Jess.,3
JESS,She did that thing where you stretch and then you put your arm around the other person's shoulder and then you sneeze and then your hand falls and you try to grab  ,3
LUKE,"Jess, stop it.",3
JESS,What do you think is gonna happen?,3
LUKE,You know what I think is gonna happen.,3
JESS,"No, I don't. Tell me. Tell me w hat I'm gonna do to her.",3
LUKE,"You're not gonna do anything to her because when you're at her place, there's Lorelai, and when you're here, there's me, and when you're out there, there's Taylor.",3
JESS,"Romeo and Juliet had warring families and they still managed to do a little damage, you know?",3
LUKE,,3
LORELAI,"Rory, let's move! They'll be here any minute.",3
RORY,I'll be right there.,3
LORELAI,And make sure to bring an extra coat.,3
RORY,Why?,3
LORELAI,"Do not ask why. It's Gilmore road rules, trust me.",3
RORY,But that doesn't make any sense. We're only gonna be gone for one day.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, do me a f avor, say those exact words to my mother when she shows up.",3
RORY,Taking the coat.,3
LORELAI,"Now, I have been doing some research on our trip.",3
RORY,Oh yeah?,3
LORELAI,Yeah. I went to the bookstore and I found this.,3
RORY,"""The Best of New Haven.""",3
LORELAI,Yeah.,3
RORY,It's light.,3
LORELAI,"It's New Haven. Anyhow, I looked through it and it just so happens that one of the best taco places on the East Coast is ten minutes from campus.",3
RORY,We like tacos.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, we do. ""You haven't had a taco until you've spent some time at Hector's, crisp and meaty   """,3
RORY,Dirty.,3
LORELAI,"Thank you. ""Not greasy. With homemade tortillas, it elevates this fast finger food to the level of haute cuisine.""",3
RORY,Sounds good.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, so I thought maybe when Dad was busy poofing it up, we could go say hello to Hector.",3
RORY,I like your thinking.,3
LORELAI,Good. Where's your stuff?,3
RORY,I put the extra coat by the door.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, I know, but where's your stuff?",3
RORY,What stuff?,3
LORELAI,"Rory, I left a list on your dresser last night.",3
RORY,I thought you were kidding.,3
LORELAI,You didn't pack?,3
RORY,Well  ,3
LORELAI,"Rory, let me exp lain something to you. The way you survive a road trip with my mother is to make sure you have all your bases covered, leave nothing to chance. Never give her the opportunity to give you a thirty-minute lecture on how, if you'd brought the second bathing suit like she told you to, it wouldn't have mattered that the first one's strap broke in a freak poolslide incident that no one, including the Amazing Kreskin, could've predicted, you would've been covered.",3
RORY,I have to bring a bathing suit? It's thirty degrees outside.,3
LORELAI,"This was an example based on a true story. Now, get a skirt to go with this.",3
RORY,But I'm still confused. When are we changing?,3
LORELAI,Not the point.,3
RORY,"We're driving, we're walking, we're eating tacos, and we're driving again.",3
LORELAI,Check the list.,3
RORY,Why do I need rain boots?,3
LORELAI,Why are you still questioning me?,3
RORY,"Should I bring both a rain hat and an umbrella, or will one or the other do? Forget it, stupid question.",3
LORELAI,"Oh wow. I guess this means there really isn't a Dean anymore, huh?",3
RORY,"Yeah, that and it broke in the shower this morning. Though I probably would've taken it off anyway.",3
LORELAI,Or Jess would've done it for you.,3
RORY,What did that mean?,3
LORELAI,It just meant Jess wouldn't want you wearing another guy's bracelet.,3
RORY,Or that Jess is a thief and he would've stolen it.,3
LORELAI,"It does work on both levels, doesn't it?",3
RORY,So this is how it's gonna be from now on?,3
LORELAI,What does that mean?,3
RORY,You like Dean and you hate Jess.,3
LORELAI,Rory.,3
RORY,Jess will always be the evil guy who mouthed off to you and wrecked my car and Dean will always be the perfect guy who would come over and change the water bottle.,3
LORELAI,"Aw, I forgot about the water bottle.",3
RORY,Mom.,3
LORELAI,"Rory, I said nothing. I didn't mean what you thought I meant about Jess. I'm trying to be supportive about this.",3
RORY,How supportive?,3
LORELAI,"Supportive. You know, go team.",3
RORY,"I'm serious, I wanna know how it's gonna be. Like, can I invite him over?",3
LORELAI,Of course you can invite him over.,3
RORY,"Well, can he actually come in to the house?",3
LORELAI,"Yes, he can come in to the house.",3
RORY,Are you going to talk to him?,3
LORELAI,Oh my God.,3
RORY,Are you going to talk to him?,3
LORELAI,I'll at least match him grunt for grunt.,3
RORY,"Okay. Now, let's say he's in the house and there's a fire, and you can either save him or your shoes   which is it?",3
LORELAI,That depends   did he start the fire?,3
RORY,Mom.,3
LORELAI,"Rory, I promised you before and I'm promising you again, I will cut this kid all kinds of slack. Did I like Dean? Yes. Did I worry about you less when you were with Dean? Yes. But I never expected you to be with Dean forever, just like I don't expect you to be with Jess forever.",3
RORY,"Oh, so now you're just waiting for the day I'm not with Jess anymore, is that it?",3
LORELAI,"You know what, I'm actually looking forward to my mother getting here.",3
RORY,I'm kidding and thank you.,3
LORELAI,,3
EMILY,Your drivers have arrived.,3
RORY,"Hi Grandma, hi Grandpa.",3
RICHARD,"Hello Rory, hello Lorelai. What a perfect day for a drive.",3
LORELAI,Sure is.,3
EMILY,You brought an umbrella?,3
RORY,And a rain cap.,3
EMILY,Excellent!,3
RICHARD,"Here, let me help you with those.",3
LORELAI,Okay.,3
EMILY,Where are you going with that?,3
LORELAI,To the car.,3
EMILY,You can't have that in the car.,3
LORELAI,I know.,3
EMILY,"Well, then, what are you doing with it?",3
LORELAI,Walking it.,3
EMILY,Lorelai.,3
LORELAI,"Mom, I know I can't have it in the car. It will not be in the car.",3
RICHARD,Is that everything?,3
LORELAI,"Yes, I think so.",3
RICHARD,"All right, then. Let's get this show on the road.",3
EMILY,Now let's see you drink it.,3
LORELAI,"Mm, good to the last drop.",3
EMILY,You stay that way until it's gone.,3
LORELAI,"Aye, aye, captain.",3
EMILY,Let's go Richard.,3
RICHARD,,3
LORELAI,"Wow, does that guy look smart. I mean it, he's got the smart look down. The glasses, the furrowed brow, the ticky walk.",3
RORY,The Kierkergaard.,3
LORELAI,I really think it's the walk.,3
RORY,"Well, we are at Yale, you know. There are smart people here.",3
LORELAI,"I know there are smart people here. I just didn't realize how many. I bet if I pulled my checkbook out now, twelve guys could help me balance it.",3
RICHARD,Thirteen if you were near the right building.,3
RORY,"Grandpa, that art gallery was amazing. Thank you.",3
RICHARD,Yale has one of the finest collections of British art in the world.,3
LORELAI,"Louvre, schmouvre.",3
RICHARD,"Oh, I spent a lot of time in that gallery as a young man.",3
EMILY,I'll say you did.,3
LORELAI,What was that  I'll say you did'?,3
EMILY,I just rememb er that that gallery was one of your father's favorite places to bring the ladies.,3
RORY,What?,3
RICHARD,Emily.,3
EMILY,It's where you took me on our first date.,3
LORELAI,"So, Dad liked to impress them with the paintings.",3
RICHARD,Why did you bring this up?,3
EMILY,"He was a master of the frown, step back, wrinkle and sigh.",3
LORELAI,The what?,3
EMILY,Frown. Step back. Wrinkle. And sigh.,3
RICHARD,I did no such thing.,3
EMILY,"And then he'd talk about the paintings he had seen in Paris and the colors of Titian, and by the end of the date, you thought he was the most brilliant man in the entire world.",3
LORELAI,Using Titian to score. Even Titian didn't do that.,3
RICHARD,You shouldn't tell them this. They'll think I was some kind of lothario.,3
EMILY,"Well, you were.",3
RICHARD,I was just a young single man who wanted to experience life.,3
LORELAI,Don't ever fall for that line.,3
RORY,I promise.,3
RICHARD,"You know, Emily, you weren't such an innocent little doe lost in the woods yourself.",3
EMILY,I beg your pardon?,3
LORELAI,"They're turning on each other, I love it.",3
RICHARD,"I'll have you know, I was happily involved in a very serious relationship when your mother decided she simply had to have me.",3
EMILY,"Oh, the size of your ego, I swear.",3
RICHARD,Linny Lott.,3
EMILY,That mouse?,3
RICHARD,"Oh, that mouse and I were engaged.",3
EMILY,"Oh, you were not.",3
RICHARD,"I'd given her my pin, I'd introduced her to my parents.",3
EMILY,So?,3
RICHARD,"The date was set, invitations mailed out.",3
LORELAI,Mom.,3
EMILY,"Well, you couldn't marry Linny Lott. That woman needed directions to get to a point.",3
LORELAI,Rawr!,3
EMILY,"Richard Gilmore, you are going to give these girls the wrong impression.",3
RORY,"What impression is that, Grandma?",3
LORELAI,That you were the Helena Bonham Carter of the society set?,3
EMILY,"I did not steal your grandfather, I simply gave him a choice.",3
RICHARD,"When you showed up at my fraternity party in that blue dress, I had no choice.",3
LORELAI,You stole my father with fashion.,3
EMILY,I can't believe you rememb er the dress.,3
LORELAI,I can't believe you were the other woman.,3
EMILY,"Oh, this is ridiculous.",3
LORELAI,Another woman should be saying this is ridiculous.,3
EMILY,Will you stop?,3
RICHARD,Well. . .,3
EMILY,Well what?,3
RICHARD,You mean you don't rememb er?,3
EMILY,Oh my God! There was a bench here.,3
RICHARD,They moved it last year.,3
EMILY,I can't believe this.,3
LORELAI,Me either. What if we wanted to sit down?,3
EMILY,This is where your father proposed?,3
RORY,Really?,3
RICHARD,That's right.,3
LORELAI,By the trash can.,3
EMILY,That's right.,3
LORELAI,"Well, that's very romantic. . .especially if you need to spit your gum out.",3
EMILY,We were going to meet my girlfriends who were going to drive me back to school.,3
RICHARD,And you were angry with me.,3
EMILY,Because you wouldn't commit to plans for the holidays.,3
RICHARD,Because I was going to invite you to the house to meet my parents after I proposed.,3
EMILY,Which I didn't know because you gave me no indication whatsoever.,3
RICHARD,"Anyway, you had just finished calling me a spineless jellyfish.",3
EMILY,"And you got very annoyed, reached in your pocket, pulled out a box and said, ""Here.""",3
RICHARD,"And you opened the box, showed no emotion, slammed it close and said, ""Fine.""",3
EMILY,"Yes, I did.",3
RORY,That's so sweet.,3
EMILY,"Oh no, my button broke.",3
LORELAI,Oh yeah? Let me see.,3
EMILY,It just broke in two and fell.,3
LORELAI,"Well, let me look, Mom.",3
EMILY,"It's a broken button, what is there to look at?",3
LORELAI,"All right, then, I think there's a bathroom over there.",3
EMILY,What can we do in a bathroom?,3
LORELAI,Meet George Michael.,3
EMILY,What?,3
LORELAI,Let's go.,3
EMILY,I don't believe it. This is a brand new skirt.,3
LORELAI,"Mom, let me see.",3
EMILY,I have this dinner to go tonight. What am I going to do?,3
LORELAI,Drink a lot. It's easier to explain not wearing a skirt if you're falling down drunk.,3
EMILY,Thank you for the advice.,3
LORELAI,"You know, I can rig this  til you get home.",3
EMILY,You can?,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, just give me five seconds here.",3
EMILY,What is that?,3
LORELAI,It's a paper clip.,3
EMILY,And what do you intend to do with that paper clip?,3
LORELAI,I intend to carve something really dirty into the bathroom door.,3
EMILY,Lorelai.,3
LORELAI,What rhymes with Nantucket?,3
EMILY,I'm standing here holding my skirt.,3
LORELAI,"I'm gonna put this paper clip through the buttonhole and then through the thread that used to hold the button, and then you're gonna put your jacket back on and there you go.",3
EMILY,That's ingenious.,3
LORELAI,"I know. If I had a thumbtack, I could make a scud m*ssile.",3
EMILY,"You know, your father's having a wonderful time.",3
LORELAI,"Well, good.",3
EMILY,It means a lot to him to share this with Rory.,3
LORELAI,I know.,3
EMILY,"Actually, it means a lot to him to share this with you and Rory. It's very nice that you're here.",3
LORELAI,"Nice for you. I just found out you're not supposed to be my real mother, so I'm a little scarred.",3
RICHARD,See that? That is my favorite building in the whole school.,3
RORY,It is?,3
RICHARD,"Yes, it is.",3
RORY,Why?,3
RICHARD,Because that's where the Timothy Dwight Dining Hall is.,3
RORY,I thought campus food was supposed to be disgusting.,3
RICHARD,Not Yale food. They have the most delicious pot roast you've ever tasted.,3
RORY,I love pot roast.,3
RICHARD,Who doesn't love pot roast? Are you having a good time?,3
RORY,I'm having a very good time.,3
RICHARD,"I'm glad. It's nice being able to show this place to another Gilmore generation. You know, one day, when your mother was ten years old, she ran into my office and she said, ""I'm going to go to Yale, just like you."" She actually took my diploma out of my office and put it in her room. She wouldn't give it back to me for about six months. This place makes you remember things. Hopefully, things you're being graded on.",3
EMILY,"All right, we're all in one piece again.",3
RICHARD,"Oh, glad to hear it. Shall we continue?",3
LORELAI,,3
RORY,Wow.,3
LORELAI,Lions and tigers and bears. . .,3
RORY,Oh my.,3
RICHARD,"It's impressive, isn't it?",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, I'd like to open a checking account, please.",3
RORY,What is this place?,3
RICHARD,"This is the main administration building. Professors' offices, the dean's office. Some of the best scotch in the country can be found behind those doors.",3
LORELAI,"Not sure how to take that, Dad.",3
RICHARD,"Come on. Ah, follow me, please.",3
LORELAI,What's he so excited about?,3
EMILY,"Oh, who knows? Dickens must have dropped a pencil here at some point.",3
RICHARD,"Rory, this is the office of a very dear friend of mine. His name is Harris Fellows, and he just happens to be the Dean of Admissions.",3
LORELAI,Really?,3
RICHARD,That's right. And I called him just before we came down and I asked him if he had a little time to squeeze you in and he said yes.,3
RORY,Squeeze me in ?,3
RICHARD,For an interview.,3
LORELAI,"An interview for what, Dad?",3
RICHARD,An interview for Yale.,3
RORY,Grandpa.,3
RICHARD,"Oh, I told him all about you and your grades and how well you were doing at Chilton. Well, of course, he insisted on seeing you. He wouldn't let me off the hook.",3
RORY,But I haven't applied to Yale.,3
RICHARD,"Oh, I told him that you weren't finished deciding, that you were being very picky. I think that made him want you even more. They can be very competitive, these Ivy League schools. He's expecting you at three. Oh, look, it's three now. Well, we timed this perfectly now, didn't we? Come on, I'll walk you in. Uh, we'll be right back.",3
LORELAI,"Rory, honey, you don't have to go in there.",3
RICHARD,"What? Well, of course she's going to go in there.",3
LORELAI,"Rory, honey, the only person I'm talking to, you don't have to go in there if you don't want to.",3
RICHARD,"Lorelai, the man is waiting.",3
LORELAI,You wanna leave?  Cause we could just leave.,3
RORY,"No, it's okay. I'll go in.",3
RICHARD,"Harris is a very nice man, Rory. I think you two are really going to hit it off. Come on, I'll walk you in.",3
EMILY,My skirt seems to be holding up very well. Lorelai  ,3
LORELAI,No.,3
RICHARD,"She shook his hand. She just reached out and shook his hand. It completely threw him off. I swear, that girl.",3
LORELAI,"You know what, I almost feel like a standing ovation is in order.",3
RICHARD,"If you're going to get dramatic, let's go outside. It echoes in here.",3
LORELAI,What did you think you were doing?,3
RICHARD,"I thought I was helping my granddaughter get into what is, in my opinion, the best Ivy League school in America.",3
LORELAI,Even though she doesn't wanna go here?,3
RICHARD,She doesn't know she doesn't want to go here.,3
LORELAI,"You're unbelievable, Dad. You corner her alone the other night, without me there.",3
RICHARD,Of course I did. You wouldn't let her go.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, I wouldn't?",3
RICHARD,I knew that the last thing in the world that you could want would be for Rory to go to Yale.,3
LORELAI,And the reason for that would be?,3
RICHARD,"I went to Yale, therefore Rory can't.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, that's right, the crazy reason.",3
RICHARD,That's all right. It's your prerogative to feel that way. It's mine to make sure that Rory at least knows all her options.,3
LORELAI,Aren't you supposed to slap my face with a glove before you do this?,3
RICHARD,I'm not going to discuss this with you.,3
LORELAI,"Well, you lied to everybody, Dad. You lied to me, you lied to Rory, I'm looking at Mom and I'm thinking you lied to her, too.",3
EMILY,"Lorelai, please, let's try and calm down.",3
RICHARD,This is for Rory's own good.,3
LORELAI,Rory's going to Harvard.,3
RICHARD,We'll see.,3
LORELAI,"No, Rory's going to Harvard. It's already been decided without you, get it? You don't control it. And that little stunt of yours doesn't change that fact one bit.",3
RICHARD,"I'm sorry about the way it had to be done, but I didn't want to argue with you about it.",3
LORELAI,"My whole life, you have tried to control everything, and if you didn't get to control something, then you just didn't deal with it.",3
RICHARD,That's ridiculous.,3
LORELAI,"When you couldn't control me, you didn't deal with me.",3
RICHARD,This has nothing to do with you.,3
LORELAI,No?,3
RICHARD,"This is about Rory and Rory's education. Which, frankly Lorelai, is something you know nothing about.",3
LORELAI,Excuse me?,3
RICHARD,"You never went to college, let alone an Ivy League college. You don't know the first thing about the system, the way it works. I do, I went through it. You want Rory to go to Harvard that badly? Well, so do thousands of other mothers. Yale is an excellent school, the equal of Harvard in every way except one   I went here. I'm an alumnus. That makes it easier for Rory to get in. And if you had any idea about the way the system works, you'd know this.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, so, here it is. I knew we would eventually get to the big ""my daughter's a loser, poor me, the future squandered, the Gilmore name's sullied"" speech.",3
RICHARD,"I am not going to leave Rory's education to chance simply because I might risk offending you. Her future is more important than your pride. If you don't like that, I'm sorry. If it makes you angry, well, what else is new? But that, my dear girl, is the way it is.",3
LORELAI,I'm calling a cab. We're leaving.,3
EMILY,"Lorelai, come back inside. Lorelai, put the phone away and come back inside.",3
LORELAI,"Yes, hi, in New Haven, I need a number of a cab company. Um, anyone, pick one. Thanks.",3
EMILY,You are not going to take a cab all the way back to Stars Hollow.,3
LORELAI,"He lied to you, too, Mom. Don't you care about that?",3
EMILY,That is between me an d your father.,3
LORELAI,"Great, whatever. Damn, I just forgot the number.",3
EMILY,If you would just calm down and look at it from his point of view.,3
LORELAI,"Hi, um, uh, in New Haven, I need a cab company, any cab company.",3
EMILY,"Your father is a very strong-willed man, Lorelai. You know this, you take after him.",3
LORELAI,Thank you.,3
EMILY,He wants the best for Rory. He thinks this is the best.,3
LORELAI,It doesn't really matter what he thinks. It matters what I think and what Rory thinks and the list ends there.,3
EMILY,So Rory takes a meet ing at Yale. That doesn't mean she still won't go to Harvard.,3
LORELAI,"I know it doesn't, because she is still going to Harvard.",3
EMILY,If she applies to Yale  ,3
LORELAI,She's not applying to Yale!,3
EMILY,"And gets into Yale, that might even make her more appealing to Harvard. Have you thought about that?",3
LORELAI,"No, I haven't, because I'm not trying to reason away a crazy man's actions.",3
EMILY,"Oh, don't do this. Don't turn this into yet another one of your crusades against your childhood. Just let it go. Realize that despite the matter in which your father did this, his intentions were honorable.",3
LORELAI,"You know what, Mom? Sometimes I literally sit around and try to figure out why Dad and I have such an awful relationship. I try to figure out why we can't communicate and why we can't seem to break through whatever crap it is that stands between us, and then something like this happens and suddenly it's like,  Oh yeah. That's why.'",3
EMILY,"Fine, Lorelai, your father's a demon. He's cruel and out to destroy your happiness. But think about this   you're fighting so hard to send Rory off to Harvard no matter what that you haven't even stopped for one second to consider that if she went to Yale, she could live at home. Consider that on your cab ride.",3
LORELAI,,3
HARRIS,It was a pleasure to meet you. I'll read that book you recommended.,3
RORY,"And don't be fooled by the Oprah seal on the cover, it's actually very good.",3
RICHARD,"Well, how did it go? I see that everyone is smiling.",3
HARRIS,"Richard, your granddaughter is everything you said and more. You should be very proud.",3
RICHARD,"I am, very proud.",3
HARRIS,It was very nice meet ing you.,3
RORY,Same here.,3
HARRIS,"I'll see you at dinner later, Richard.",3
RICHARD,"Thanks, Harris.",3
RICHARD,"Well, that   that sounded like it went very well. Uh, what did you tell him to read?",3
RORY,Why did you do that?,3
RICHARD,Do what?,3
RORY,Why did you make this appointment without telling me about it?,3
RICHARD,"Rory, I know this appointment upset your mother, but this was an important opportunity.",3
RORY,"I know it was an important opportunity. That's why I can't believe you didn't prepare me for it. I didn't have my transcripts, my letters of recommendation. I couldn't even remember what I wanted to major in when he asked.",3
RICHARD,I'm sure he knew you were nervous.,3
RORY,But I didn't have to be that nervous. I could've been calm. I could've brushed my hair. I never would've worn this.,3
RICHARD,"Oh, Rory, none of this matters.",3
RORY,"It matters to me. I like to be prepared. This has nothing to do with Mom. If you had really wanted me to take this meet ing, I would've done it just because you asked me to. And I would've done it right.",3
LORELAI,"Rory, a cab is meet ing us at the main gate. Let's go.",3
RORY,I'm coming. Bye Grandma.,3
EMILY,Goodbye Rory.,3
EMILY,,3
LORELAI,"Thanks. Uh, well, here's the good news. You no longer have to worry about which college to go to  cause that cab ride was your college tuition.",3
RORY,Can we not say the word college for at least forty-eight hours?,3
LORELAI,Fine.,3
RORY,Thank you.,3
LORELAI,"How  bout collage, can we say collage?  Cause it sounds the same but it's actually very different.",3
RORY,Collage is fine.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, good,  cause I don't even know how to get through a conversation without the word collage.",3
RORY,I should've listened to you about today.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, no. There's no way even I could've seen this one coming.",3
RORY,I can't believe I had a meet ing at Yale today.,3
LORELAI,I know.,3
RORY,And I can't believe the only name that popped into my head when he asked for my role model was Gloria Estefan.,3
LORELAI,"Well, you don't work great under pressure.",3
RORY,Sucky day.,3
LORELAI,But excellent tacos.,3
RORY,"Yeah, Hector really came through.",3
LUKE,What are you doing?,3
LORELAI,We're coming from a day with my parents. Want a taco?,3
LUKE,"Uh, no thanks. See, I already have food here. We sell it to the other customers who don't come quite as prepared as the two of you.",3
LORELAI,"Mm, be nice and get us some salsa.",3
LUKE,At least order a cup of coffee.,3
RORY,Coffee and tacos?,3
LORELAI,Sounds just gross enough to work.,3
JESS,Hi.,3
RORY,Hi.,3
LUKE,"Please, I'll finish it   hi, hi, hi, hi, hi. I'm getting the coffee.",3
JESS,I gotta run out for a second and get a part for my car.,3
LUKE,Get a receipt this time.,3
JESS,I'll be back.,3
LORELAI,"Hey Luke, what's the record for most tacos eaten in a diner that doesn't actually sell tacos?",3
LUKE,I have no idea.,3
LORELAI,"Find out, will you,  cause if it's less than five, we're famous.",3
LUKE,Where'd you get those things anyhow?,3
LORELAI,New Haven.,3
LUKE,Really? That dump was close?,3
LORELAI,We paid a little visit to Yale today.,3
RORY,"Yes, one that I would prefer not to relive, thank you very much. I'm gonna go study.",3
LORELAI,"Okay hon, see you back home.",3
RORY,Bye Luke.,3
LUKE,Bye.,3
LUKE,"Uh, listen, I just want you to know that I had a little talk with Jess earlier.",3
LORELAI,You did?,3
LUKE,"Yes, I did, and I really laid down the rules concerning him and Rory. Trust me, he now knows that I am going to be watching them every second they are together.",3
LORELAI,Oh good.,3
LUKE,Yup.,3
LORELAI,"You know, they're together now.",3
LUKE,What?,3
LORELAI,"Oh yeah.  I have to get a part for my car',  I'm going to go study'   that's kid code for  Meet me at the previously agreed upon location far away from my clueless uncle.'",3
LUKE,"You're kidding me, right? You don't really think that. . .damn, they are! They're together. They used the kid code and now they're together!",3
LORELAI,"It's okay, Luke.",3
LUKE,"It's okay, Luke? They are out there right now doing God knows what, completely unsupervised. How did you let this happen?",3
LORELAI,Me?,3
LUKE,"Yes, you. I thought you were against this.",3
LORELAI,"I thought you were all,  This is so great and Rory's gonna change Jess.'",3
LUKE,"What is she, a miracle worker? Come on, Lorelai, wake up   the guy's trouble. I have to find them. Caesar, I'll be back in a little while.",3
LORELAI,You're seriously gonna run all over town looking for Jess and Rory?,3
LUKE,"If I have to, yes. And if you were really a concerned mother, you'd go out there with me.",3
LORELAI,"No, I can't do that. But if you like, I'll let you sniff Rory's sweater. Maybe her scent will help you track them down.",3
LUKE,The things you find amusing astound me sometimes.,3
LORELAI,You're not really gonna sniff it.,3
LUKE,,3
RORY,You going to smoke that or mind meld with it?,3
JESS,It depends.,3
RORY,So where's the part for your car?,3
JESS,"Huh, I don't know. Gypsy said she was gonna leave it for me somewhere. Guess she forgot.",3
RORY,She's bad that way.,3
JESS,I'm just gonna have to take my business elsewhere.,3
RORY,Looks that way.,3
JESS,So.,3
RORY,So.,3
JESS,Here we are.,3
RORY,"Yeah, here we are. So, tell me, what's your decision about smoking that depending on?",3
JESS,On what's gonna happen.,3
RORY,When?,3
JESS,Now.,3
RORY,I'm glad you didn't smoke it.,3
JESS,Oh yeah?,3
RORY,Yeah.,3
JESS,"Well, whatever else happens between us, at least we know that part works. What?",3
RORY,I have to go.,3
JESS,What? Did I do something or  ,3
RORY,"No, no. This was. . . you were   are. . .it was wonderful, and I look forward to many similar occurrences in the future, but right now, I have to go. Understand?",3
JESS,Not at all.,3
RORY,"It's more fun that way, isn't it?",3
JESS,Come here. Beat it.,3
RORY,,3
RORY,Hey.,3
DEAN,What are you doing?,3
RORY,I climbed a tree.,3
DEAN,Why?,3
RORY,"Well, I was afraid to ring the doorbell  cause your mom would answer and I assume she knows, so I assume she hates me an d I just wanted to talk to you, so. . .",3
DEAN,She doesn't know.,3
RORY,She doesn't.,3
DEAN,I haven't really been in the mood to talk about it.,3
RORY,"But you're going to have to tell her eventually, so if she did answer the door and was nice to me, then I would've known that she was going to be hating me soon, and that just would've been really hard because I like your mom. I guess you're probably gonna tell your sister also, so she's probably gonna hate me, too.",3
DEAN,"Well, too bad, Rory. Somebody doesn't like you for once.",3
RORY,I didn't mean  ,3
DEAN,What do you want?,3
RORY,Do you rememb er that girl Butterfly who lived in a tree for a year? I can officially attest that she was nuts.,3
DEAN,I have to go.,3
RORY,I wanna say that I'm sorry.,3
DEAN,For what?,3
RORY,"For treating you the way I did. For doing all the things you said I did. I am so, so sorry. It's all my fault. I don't know what's wrong with me. You were the most amazing boyfriend in the world. You made me so happy. You made me laugh, you made my mother like you, you were nice to my friends, you protected me, you even came with me to that stupid debutante ball.",3
DEAN,I don't need the list.,3
RORY,I really did love you. Please believe that.,3
DEAN,You with him now?,3
RORY,"I don't wanna talk about him. I just came to tell you that I'm truly sorry that I hurt you, and that I'm going to miss you so much, and I just hope that someday you won't hate me anymore.",3
DEAN,,3
LORELAI,Coffee and Ovaltine.,3
RORY,Thanks.,3
LORELAI,"It's getting late, you almost done?",3
RORY,Almost.,3
LORELAI,"Don't study so much that you get brilliant, go mad, grow a big bald egghead and try to take over the world, okay,  cause I wanna go shoe shopping this weekend.",3
RORY,"Promise, I will not go mad until we get you some boots.",3
LORELAI,Thank you. Hey.,3
RORY,Yeah?,3
LORELAI,How was the rest of the evening?,3
RORY,It was eventful.,3
LORELAI,"Eventful. . . well, okay. Goodnight hon.",3
RORY,Mom?,3
LORELAI,Yeah?,3
RORY,Details tomorrow.,3
LORELAI,"Ah, thank God.  Cause you know what not knowing these things does to me.",3
RORY,I know.,3
LORELAI,I can't sleep. I wonder what I did wrong. Should I not have left you that first day in kindergarten when you begged me not to? Are you holding it against me?,3
RORY,I was fine staying at kindergarten. You were the one that had trouble leaving.,3
LORELAI,"See, see how irrational I get when you hold out on me? I invent crazy reasons why you hold out on me.",3
RORY,Night Mom.,3

RORY,I like these women.,3
LORELAI,I love these women.,3
RORY,Poor Edie.,3
LORELAI,Which Edie?,3
RORY,Little Edie. She's just trying to sing and her mom won't stop talking.,3
LORELAI,Big Edie was so beautiful in her day.,3
RORY,They were both pretty.,3
LORELAI,I can't believe they were related to Jackie.,3
RORY,"Well, the Kennedy's kind of hid them in the background for many years.",3
LORELAI,"Well, when you're a Kennedy, how do you even choose who in the family to hide?",3
RORY,It's a tough choice.,3
LORELAI,"Something beautiful about them though. They're cool, they're free.",3
RORY,"Yeah, and they're memo rable. Most people are very forgettable. And they're happy.",3
LORELAI,They had their cats.,3
RORY,And their raccoons.,3
LORELAI,And their pretty house.,3
RORY,And each other.,3
Posted,12/08/02 19:12,3
LORELAI,Add a few years and they're us.,3
RORY,Yeah. . .yeah.,3
LORELAI,,3
SOOKIE,"Rhiana, run it through the sieve again, I want it smooth as glass. Don't cut corners, people!",3
LORELAI,Is she melting down?,3
MICHELorelai,Like butter on a skillet.,3
LORELAI,Sookie. . .,3
SOOKIE,"Just a sec, hon. How's your love life, Pete? A little frustrated, I bet. Wondering how I know that?  Cause you're taking it out on my egg whites. Gently, fold them gently. Cheryl   you're slicing not dicing, I can hear it in the chop. Adjust, my friend.",3
LORELAI,"Sookie, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, let's talk.",3
SOOKIE,I'm extremely lacking in time here.,3
LORELAI,What's going on?,3
SOOKIE,"Uh, chaos? Uh, a travesty of cooking? It's a salmonella laboratory in here!",3
LORELAI,"Sookie, the kitchen will be in good hands.",3
SOOKIE,But not in my hands.,3
LORELAI,It'll be in Bob hands. Bob has great hands.,3
SOOKIE,"No, you know what Bob has? Bob has two seconds to get the hollandaise off the flame before I break his neck!",3
LORELAI,"Sookie, listen, you hired Bob. You trained him in your image. He's great, and he's subbed for you before.",3
SOOKIE,"But this is Thanksgiving, he has never done Thanksgiving.",3
LORELAI,"He's ready, he'll sub for you seamlessly. Even Big Joe Newsanchor's have substitutes.",3
SOOKIE,"And that's the thing. They still say,  And now the CBS Evening News with Dan Rather.' You see? Dan is still associated with it even though he's off snorkeling or something, just like I'm gonna be associated with the dinner because Bob is substituting for Sookie. Excuse me one minute.",3
MICHELorelai,"Oh, this can only be good.",3
LORELAI,"Sookie, that's the garbage. Stop rooting through the garbage.",3
SOOKIE,I will when people stop throwing away useful stuff!,3
LORELAI,"Drop, drop the, drop the tops, drop them, drop them. Come here, come here, come here. Now, Sookie, listen to me because you're torturing yourself here.",3
SOOKIE,"Emily, hi.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, that's nice. That's very high school. Stick with me here.",3
SOOKIE,Good to see you.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, ah, that's funny. You know who's behind you? It's Joseph Stalin, my good friend. What are you doing back from the dead, Joe?",3
EMILY,Lorelai.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, Mom! Ah, geez, you scared me.",3
EMILY,You heard Sookie greet me.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, I thought it was a joke.",3
EMILY,Like comparing me to Joseph Stalin?,3
LORELAI,I wasn't comparing you to Joseph Stalin.,3
EMILY,I'm in a hurry. Can we speak for a minute?,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, I guess, for a minute. So, were you in the area or something?",3
EMILY,Not really.,3
LORELAI,Then what are you doing here?,3
EMILY,I wanted to talk to you.,3
LORELAI,Phone's out of order?,3
EMILY,Let's not play games here.,3
LORELAI,Games?,3
EMILY,I've called several times the past few weeks and you've skillfully avoided every call.,3
LORELAI,"No, that's not true. I've left messages on your machine.",3
EMILY,"Yes, messages. And then if I happened to pick up, you'd hang up. Or if the maid picked up, you'd ask for me, then claim you were driving through a tunnel so you might get cut off, and then you'd make garbling noises and hang up.",3
LORELAI,"Fine, Mom, we're talking now. What's up?",3
EMILY,Are you feeling well?,3
LORELAI,You came al l the way out here to ask me that?,3
EMILY,"Well, you've been sick these past few Friday's for dinner, so I was concerned. That's why you didn't come, right, because you were sick? So are you better? You look fine.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, it's the makeup. I'm still. . .uh, these allergies really just hit me like a ton of bricks.",3
EMILY,I've never heard you mention allergies before.,3
LORELAI,I'm a silent sufferer.,3
EMILY,"Well, I certainly hope you're feeling better now because I want you to come to dinner tomorrow night.",3
LORELAI,Tomorrow? Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.,3
EMILY,"Yes, it is Thanksgiving. And before you sift through the dozen or so excuses you always have on hand, let me have my say. You've missed two dinners and avoided my calls because you're mad at us about what happened at Yale. But I want you and Rory at Thanksgiving this year.",3
LORELAI,Mom  ,3
EMILY,If you have plans  ,3
LORELAI,We do have plans.,3
EMILY,"Alter them. Now, there'll be other people there, so the focus won't be on you, and you may even be able to get by without saying more than  hello',  goodbye', and  pass the gravy'.",3
LORELAI,We already have plans.,3
EMILY,"Your father and I are going out of town the next day and we'll be gone all of December, including Christmas, so it's the last chance for the family to be together for the rest of the year.",3
LORELAI,Look  ,3
EMILY,"And I want you to rememb er that I am not the one who set the meeting for Rory behind your back. I want you there, Lorelai. And if you're still sick, I don't want a doctor's note. I want your doctor himself to come to my house and convince me that it's true, got it?",3
LORELAI,Got it.,3
EMILY,,3
TEACHERory,"The multi-layered memb rane systems of the cytoplasm are the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and the golgi body. Now, the smooth endoplasmic reticulum is concerned with the manufacture of lipid molecules. We'll continue on this next week. Keep up on your reading please.",3
MADELINE,That was really distracting.,3
PARIS,"Oh. Well, by all means, Madeline, you should point out to the faculty that their annoyingcustom of teaching is distracting you from more important things like nail filing and daydreaming about marrying Ryan Phillippe.",3
LOUISE,"Uh, he's already married.",3
PARIS,Then whatever strawhead actor isn't.,3
MADELINE,"This was bad. For the last five minutes, every single thing she said sounded dirty.",3
LOUISE,"Yeah, same here.",3
PARIS,Good God.,3
MADELINE,"I mean, reticulum? Come on.",3
LOUISE,"Plus, the golgi body. I mean, is it me or is that majorly pornographic?",3
PARIS,My life with the Banger sisters.,3
RORY,"So, changing the subject. . .",3
PARIS,Hallelujah.,3
RORY,What's everybody doing for Thanksgiving?,3
PARIS,I can't even talk about Thanksgiving.,3
RORY,Louise?,3
LOUISE,I m having dinner with my dad.,3
MADELINE,Isn't he still in jail?,3
LOUISE,"Yes, but his company donated some treadmills for the inmates so he swung a special trailer for dinner that they're gonna set up for us in the parking lot. We have it for about two hours and then one of the Manson girls gets us.",3
MADELINE,You're lucky it's in that order.,3
PARIS,My Thanksgiving is turning into a Wes Craven movie.,3
RORY,How so?,3
PARIS,I called shelters to volunteer to serve food. It's Thanksgiving   you'd think they have needs. Nope. Every stupid soup kitchen in town turned me down because they have enough volunteers.,3
MADELINE,Bummer .,3
PARIS,"I'm on a couple waiting lists, but it doesn't look good.",3
RORY,I've never heard of too many volunteers.,3
PARIS,Who are all these jackasses who volunteered anyway? They can't all be students like me. They're not all putting it on a college application. I get something out of it and these other people don't get a thing. Talk about selfish.,3
LOUISE,Sore subject.,3
RORY,"What are you up to, Madeline?",3
MADELINE,"I've got more college applications to fill out. Backups, safety schools.",3
LOUISE,"I've got some of that, too. I'm so behind.",3
PARIS,I told you guys to have those things done by now.,3
LOUISE,"Sorry, Mom.",3
PARIS,It's not about being sorry. It's about being prepared. I got Harvard and my backups in weeks ago.,3
MADELINE,"Okay, all you're doing is making me more nervous. I'll see you guys Monday.",3
LOUISE,Same here.,3
RORY,"Yup, see you guys Monday.",3
PARIS,"Harvard is going to be expecting Thanksgiving shelter work. They'll know I called too late and it will totally impugn my organizational skills. By the way, you know I ultimately do all these things for the good of mankind, right?",3
RORY,Oh yeah.,3
PARIS,Sometimes I don't think I come of f that way.,3
RORY,No.,3
PARIS,,3
RORY,"So she coldcocked you, huh?",3
LORELAI,"She bit me, incapacitated me with her poison, and devoured me whole.",3
RORY,But how are we going to go to four Thanksgiving dinners?,3
LORELAI,"It's not four, is it?",3
RORY,"Lane's house, Sookie's, and we always stop by Luke's. . .that's three, and Grandma and Grandpa is four.",3
LORELAI,"Ah, we're mad, Edie.",3
RORY,"We're us, Edie.",3
LORELAI,"Well, we've gotta go to my parents' or we'll be brought up on w*r crimes. Lane's is always super early, so that's easy to catch. Sookie's is mid afternoon.",3
RORY,Luke's the toughie.,3
LORELAI,Guess that's the one we'll have to skip.,3
RORY,Bummer .,3
LORELAI,"I know, but he won't care. Holidays are nothing to him anyway.",3
LORELAI,Hey Kirk. Discover a new freaky fetish?,3
KIRK,What?,3
LORELAI,Nothing. You buy a cat?,3
KIRK,Yup. I'm very excited.,3
LORELAI,You seem it. So what's all this?,3
RORY,I'm assuming there's nothing left in the store.,3
KIRK,"Actually, there are a number of things left.",3
RORY,"No, I meant you seem to be buying a lot of stuff.",3
KIRK,"Oh, sorry. My excitement must be clouding my ability to judge comedic hyperbole.",3
LORELAI,So where'd you get the cat?,3
KIRK,A lady had a bunch of them at the grocery store and Kirk seemed to take an instant liking to me.,3
LORELAI,Kirk?,3
KIRK,Yes?,3
LORELAI,"No, I mean, the cat's name is Kirk?",3
KIRK,Yup.,3
LORELAI,Weird coincidence or. . .,3
KIRK,I named him Kirk.,3
LORELAI,Isn't that confusing?,3
KIRK,Not when you think about it.,3
LORELAI,"No, it's still confusing.",3
KIRK,"I like the name, and whenever I call Kirk's name, I obviously won't be calling myself.",3
LORELAI,True.,3
KIRK,"Although when my mom calls for Kirk, that may be confusing. Maybe I can get her to say CatKirk when she's calling Kirk, and HumanKirk when she's calling me.",3
RORY,That would keep it straight.,3
KIRK,I'm glad I ran into you. See ya.,3
LORELAI,"See ya, HumanKirk.",3
RORY,Bye HumanKirk.,3
RORY,"He's always been a cat person, he's just never had a cat.",3
LORELAI,,3
LORELAI,Hey. Anywhere?,3
LUKE,Anywhere.,3
LORELAI,"Hm, would you mind moving?",3
LUKE,I hate when you do that.,3
LORELAI,It's my showstopper.,3
LUKE,An empty table.,3
LORELAI,Ah. You ready to order?,3
RORY,I'm ready.,3
LUKE,"Don't bother, saw you coming, already ordered your Wednesday usual   the French dip, extra fries, the every-Wednesday cherry pie.",3
RORY,Such service.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, and such a food rut we're in.",3
RORY,"Thank you, Luke.",3
LUKE,I gotta get back to stuffing my turkey.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, honey, do you have time to do that and prep your Thanksgiving food?",3
LUKE,Stop it.,3
RORY,"Here, here.",3
LUKE,It's a tedious job.,3
LORELAI,"Well, what if we told you you could stuff one less?",3
LUKE,What do you mean?,3
LORELAI,"We got jammed . Shanghaied by my mother and what with the other things we have going. . .well, too many commit ments, not enough us.",3
LUKE,So?,3
RORY,We can't make it tomorrow.,3
LUKE,"Oh, okay, fine.",3
LORELAI,It was beyond our control.,3
LUKE,"That's fine, whatever. I'll be right back.",3
LORELAI,"Um, okay, I may be crazy, but he almost looked. . . .",3
RORY,Disappointed.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, disappointed. We disappointed Luke.",3
RORY,I didn't think it was possible.,3
LORELAI,Our powers are greater than we know.,3
RORY,He actually likes it when we come for Thanksgiving. All these years and we never knew.,3
LORELAI,"Hm, he's the Grinch and we're Cindy Lou Who.",3
RORY,"So Cindy Lou, what do we do?",3
LORELAI,I got it.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, uh, perfect. That works great. Okay, bye now. Sorry, I'm just clarifying the schedule for tomorrow. As luck has it, we can make it. We'll definitely be here.",3
LUKE,It's okay.,3
LORELAI,"No, it's all cleared. That was my mom, and, uh, the time's just gonna work out just fine.",3
LUKE,"Really, you don't have to. I already stopped prepping the last turkey.",3
LORELAI,"Well, start prepping it again  cause we are coming.",3
LUKE,I don't want you to feel like you have to come.,3
LORELAI,This is tiring.,3
RORY,I can kneel behind him and you can push him over.,3
LORELAI,It may come to that.,3
LUKE,It won't be a hassle?,3
LORELAI,It won't be a hassle.,3
LUKE,You sure?,3
LORELAI,"We're coming, now go away and let us eat. Shoo, shoo.",3
RORY,That was very nice.,3
LORELAI,"Well, I hate disappointing people.",3
RORY,"Okay, now, practical question. . . how are we going to eat four Thanksgiving dinners?",3
LORELAI,"How? Rory, what are we if not world champion eaters?",3
RORY,It's too much food.,3
LORELAI,It's not too much food. This is what we've been training for our whole lives. This is our destiny. This is our finest hour.,3
RORY,Or final hour.,3
LORELAI,"No, no. Get inspired and tomorrow I guarantee you, we will be standing on the Olympic platform receiving our gold medals for eating. We are not Michelle Kwan-ing this.",3
RORY,"Okay, okay, four dinners.",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, we'll skip the rolls.",3
RORY,"That'll help. You know, we might wanna consider not eating much now in preparation for our finest hour. A little fasting so that we can enjoy more tomorrow, hm?",3
LORELAI,Unnecessary.,3
RORY,,3
RORY,What's on the list?,3
LORELAI,Flowers for everyone we're visiting and cranberry sauce for the Kims.,3
RORY,Tums.,3
LORELAI,You mean amateur pills?,3
RORY,Just in case.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, Tums.",3
RORY,I'll do the flowers.,3
LORELAI,I'll do Doose's.,3
RORY,Thank you.,3
JESS,Hey there.,3
RORY,"Hey. Wait, stop.",3
JESS,What?,3
RORY,Stop.,3
JESS,What are you doing?,3
RORY,Come on.,3
JESS,What was that?,3
RORY,That was a kiss.,3
JESS,What's with the relocation before the kiss?,3
RORY,It's too early.,3
JESS,Too early? Too early for what?,3
RORY,For kissing like that.,3
JESS,"What's the rule, no kissing before noon?",3
RORY,"No, it's too early to do this here.",3
JESS,"Where, in the street?",3
RORY,"In the street, with people watching...",3
JESS,What people?,3
RORY,In front of Doose's.,3
JESS,"Ah, Doose's.",3
RORY,We shouldn't flaunt it.,3
JESS,But I want to flaunt it.,3
RORY,It doesn't feel right.,3
JESS,He's a big boy Rory.,3
RORY,I know.,3
JESS,It's not the first time a c ouple's broken up.,3
RORY,It is for us.,3
JESS,This is insane.,3
RORY,"Please, let's not flaunt it, please?",3
JESS,For how long?,3
RORY,Until it's comfortable.,3
JESS,Before we're on Social Security?,3
RORY,"I promise, we can kiss secretly.",3
JESS,"Yeah, or we can wear Three Stooges masks all the time, that way no one will know who we are.",3
RORY,I can be Curly.,3
JESS,I'll be Moe.,3
RORY,Probably too silly.,3
JESS,"Yeah, probably.",3
RORY,"This will get better over time, I promise. But until then, let's just play it cool.",3
JESS,"Hey, I'm Frank at the Sands.",3
RORY,,3
LORELAI,"Oh, hey, Kirk. Doing your holiday shopping?",3
KIRK,"Well, shopping, yes, and it is a holiday, but my shopping isn't holiday related, so technically no.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, what happened there?",3
KIRK,"Oh, nothing, just a little scratch.",3
LORELAI,"Looks like a big scratch. Wow, Bactine, Neosporin, Mercurochrome   what's with all the pharmacologicals?",3
KIRK,"Oh, well, Kirk and I are going through a little adjustment period, that's all.",3
LORELAI,CatKirk?,3
KIRK,"It's no biggie, and this looks a lot worse than it is.",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, I can see that. So how'd it happen? Were you playing or something?",3
KIRK,We haven't actually played yet. This happened when I accidentally walked into the room without announcing myself.,3
LORELAI,Excuse me?,3
KIRK,I've discovered Kirk likes my presence announced before I enter any room that he's in.,3
LORELAI,You have to announce yourself?,3
KIRK,"Yeah, just a quick,  Is it okay if I come in?' from the adjacent room. Otherwise, he gets a little testy.",3
LORELAI,Hence the scratch.,3
KIRK,"It's just a small laceration. Again, no biggie.",3
LORELAI,"Kirk, he got your neck!",3
KIRK,That was another mistake of mine. I put his food bowl down in front of him. He doesn't like that. Or she doesn't.,3
LORELAI,She? I thought Kirk was a boy.,3
KIRK,That was just a guess. He actually hasn't exposed his underside to me yet. Or hers.,3
LORELAI,"Well, here's hoping your cat exposes itself to you soon.",3
KIRK,From your mouth to God's ears. See ya.,3
LORELAI,See ya.,3
LORELAI,Hi there.,3
DEAN,Hi.,3
LORELAI,"So you pulled the Thanksgiving shift, huh?",3
DEAN,"Yeah, I get time an d a half.",3
LORELAI,"Well, good, good. It's good to see you.",3
DEAN,"Same here. Um, so, I gotta work.",3
LORELAI,"Right, right. That Taylor's a dictator.",3
DEAN,Yeah.,3
LORELAI,"Dean, wait. Um, look, we live in a teeny tiny little hamlet here. I mean, stick it in anenvelope and we could mail the whole town for a buck-forty. It makes avoiding people tough and uncomfortable.",3
DEAN,I know.,3
LORELAI,"I hate hiding from people, especially when I don't wanna hide from them. You were a pal. You were so good to Rory. You were the best first boyfriend a mother could've hoped for.",3
DEAN,Thanks.,3
LORELAI,"It's okay to keep avoiding me if you want. I just wanted you to know that you don't need to, okay? Just because you and Rory broke up doesn't mean we did.",3
DEAN,Good. That's good to hear.,3
LORELAI,"Well, Happy Thanksgiving.",3
DEAN,,3
LORELAI,"Aw, pretty!",3
RORY,"Yeah, good selection today. You get everything?",3
LORELAI,And then some. Look.,3
RORY,"Chocolate turkeys, nice!",3
LORELAI,I think they'll add a festive air.,3
RORY,"Definitely. So, was he in there?",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, he was.",3
RORY,"Good, good. I hope he's good. Did he seem good?",3
LORELAI,He seemed good. He's getting time and a half.,3
RORY,"Good, good.",3
LORELAI,"So, let's go eat.",3
RORY,And eat and eat.,3
LORELAI,And eat and eat and eat.,3
RORY,And eat and eat and eat and eat. . .,3
LORELAI,And eat and eat and eat and eat. . .,3
RORY,And eat some mo re.,3
LORELAI,,3
KIM,"Ah, the Gilmores. Happy Thanksgiving.",3
LORELAI,Happy Thanksgiving.,3
RORY,,3
KIM,Come in .,3
LORELAI,She's in a good mood this year.,3
RORY,Downright chipper.,3
LORELAI,"So, um, Mrs. Kim, we, uh, we brought gifts.",3
RORY,Flowers.,3
LORELAI,,3
KIM,"Thank you, can never have too much.",3
RORY,That's what we say.,3
LORELAI,,3
KIM,What should I do with this?,3
LORELAI,,3
KIM,And then send a blank check to their dentist?,3
LORELAI,,3
KIM,Play with chocolate? It's missing its head.,3
LORELAI,,3
KIM,Okay.,3
LORELAI,My arms are too short to box with Mrs. Kim.,3
RORY,The singing's already begun.,3
LORELAI,Mm. Who's that playing guitar? He looks familiar.,3
RORY,"Oh my God, that's Lane's Dave.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, it is. He's all neat and tidy.",3
RORY,He's gone corporate.,3
LORELAI,He's gone Korean.,3
LANE,"Oh, hey, hi.",3
RORY,"Hey yourself. Hey, how'd you get your mom to let you  ",3
LANE,"Come on, girls, let's get you some punch.",3
RORY,What's going on?,3
LANE,That is not Dave Rygalski.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, intrigue.",3
RORY,Who is it?,3
LANE,"I mean, not the one that I'm in a band with. That is Dave Rygalski, local Christian guitar player that my mom and I met very briefly and innocently at the dance marathon, and that I coincidentally ran across again when I found his ad seeking Christian guitar accompaniment gigs up on our church bulletin board.",3
LORELAI,Complicated.,3
LANE,I even put the fake ad up at church and pretended to find it with my mom next to me.,3
RORY,You're good.,3
LORELAI,"So, are you guys dating?",3
LANE,"We're laying the groundwork. If she gets to know him before we date and she approves of him, we won't have to hide anything.",3
LORELAI,"Right, except how you met.",3
RORY,And who he really is.,3
LANE,,3
KIM,"Watch it. You break it, you buy it. Ten percent off for cousins, twenty percent off for nephews and nieces.",3
LORELAI,,3
KIM,Try the tofurkey. Turkey made from tofu.,3
RORY,"Oh, we definitely will.",3
LORELAI,,3
KIM,"And meet the guitar player. Nice young man, big fan of tofurkey. David?",3
DAVE,,3
KIM,This is Rory Gilmore and Mrs. Gilmore.,3
LORELAI,"Hi, nice to meet you.",3
DAVE,"Oh, same here.",3
RORY,I think I've seen you around town.,3
DAVE,"Yeah, that might be a possibility. Happy Thanksgiving.",3
LORELAI,,3
KIM,Hymn 17 please.,3
DAVE,"Yes, ma'am.",3
LORELAI,,3
KIM,Not a bad sight-reader either.,3
RORY,You're taking tofurkey?,3
LORELAI,"Uh huh, and some ext ra napkins to slip the tofurkey into when no one is looking and then toss them away.",3
RORY,Very smart.,3
LANE,,3
KIM,"No break, he's paid to play. We can quit singing for now, but he should play soft in the background, okay?",3
DAVE,,3
RORY,The best laid plans.,3
LORELAI,Tell me ab out it.,3
RORY,How do you feel?,3
LORELAI,I ate tofurkey. How do you think I feel?,3
RORY,Tofurkier.,3
LORELAI,Drat that Mrs. Kim for not taking her eyes off me the whole time. . . it's like she was anticipating my napkin maneuver.,3
LORELAI,Hi hon!,3
RORY,Happy Thanksgiving.,3
SOOKIE,"Ah, thank you. Thank God, civilization has arrived.",3
LORELAI,What's wrong?,3
SOOKIE,"What's wrong? Uh, do you not see what's going on here?",3
LORELAI,What's that?,3
SOOKIE,That is a vat of boiling oil.,3
LORELAI,Really? Where's Quasimodo?,3
SOOKIE,This is not a joking matter.,3
RORY,What is the oil for?,3
LORELAI,For pouring on visigoths.,3
SOOKIE,Lorelai!,3
LORELAI,When else am I gonna get to use my visigoth material?,3
RORY,What's the oil for?,3
SOOKIE,"The turkey. My beautiful, expensive, organically grown turkey.",3
LORELAI,I don't get it.,3
SOOKIE,"A couple of days ago, Jackson asked me if he could cook the turkey. I thought he was gonna roast it, stick a couple of onions around it, something simple. So I said yes, figuring that the minute he put it in the oven and leaves the kitchen, I can sneak in and give it a nice herb-bitter rub and stuff it with a pancetta-chestnut stuffing.",3
LORELAI,"Sure,  cause he'd never notice that.",3
SOOKIE,"Exactly. Then the propane t*nk arrived, and the industrial burner, and the fifteen gallons of peanut oil. Then he springs it on me    I'm gonna deep-fry a turkey.""",3
LORELAI,Deep-fried turkey.,3
RORY,Interesting.,3
SOOKIE,"I tried to talk him out of it, but I'd already promised and now he's excited about it. GUY 1: Hey, what's keeping Jackson? Is he on the pot or something?",3
SOOKIE,"Lots of precious memo ries in the making here. GUY 1: Hey Jackson, get your butt out here with that gobbler!",3
SOOKIE,A gobbler.,3
RORY,Maybe it won't be that bad.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, deep-frying's kind of in now.",3
SOOKIE,"I don't care. You don't deep-fry turkey. Uh, filet of fish, yes. A batch of fries, yes. A donut, yes. Not turkey. GUY 1: Come on, let's get going! GUY 2: Yeah, we're hungry!",3
EVERYONE,"Jackson, Jackson, Jackson, Jackson, Jackson, Jackson, Jackson, Jackson. . .",3
JACKSON,Did someone say. . .Jackson?,3
LORELAI,"Wow, it's like Thunderdome in here.",3
SOOKIE,He should've just driven it out on a monster truck. He's shamelessly catering to his demographic.,3
JACKSON,Are you ready?,3
SOOKIE,"Oh my God, I can't look.",3
EVERYONE,"Ten, nine, eight, seven, six. . .",3
SOOKIE,"Oh my God, they're counting down.",3
EVERYONE,". . .five, four, three, two, one!",3
LORELAI,It's in the vat.,3
SOOKIE,It's like a death in the family.,3
LORELAI,"Look at the bright side, Sookie. At least this took your mind off the dinner at the inn.",3
SOOKIE,"Oh my God, the inn. What if Bob decides to do something equally awful to the turkey at the inn? I have to call him.",3
JACKSON,"Oh, hey guys.",3
LORELAI,Hey.,3
JACKSON,"Neat, huh? And it only takes forty minutes.",3
LORELAI,Cool.,3
JACKSON,"How ya doing, hon?",3
SOOKIE,,3
LORELAI,Hey everybody.,3
BABETTE,"Oh, hey there dollfaces. Happy Thanksgiving.",3
MOREY,"Yeah, Happy Thanksgiving.",3
RORY,Hey.,3
LUKE,What's this?,3
RORY,Flowers.,3
LUKE,What do I do with them?,3
LORELAI,"Ugh, not this again.",3
RORY,Put them in a vase with water.,3
LUKE,I don't have a vase.,3
LORELAI,You do this every year.,3
LUKE,I don't have vases.,3
LORELAI,Buy a vase.,3
LUKE,But I don't need a vase  cause I never have flowers.,3
LORELAI,Except when we bring you flowers every year on Thanksgiving. Buy a vase.,3
LUKE,Stop bringing me flowers.,3
LORELAI,Stop bringing me flowers. I knew you were gonna say that because you say the same thing. We have this same exac t conversation every year.,3
LUKE,And every year you point that out.,3
LORELAI,And every year you point that out.,3
LUKE,And every year you point that out.,3
RORY,And then every year we put the flowers on the counter and forget the ugliness ever happened.,3
LORELAI,"Well, at least we have a tradition.",3
LUKE,Good. I'll be right back. That's our table over there.,3
LORELAI,Hey Kirk. Oh my God!,3
RORY,What happened?,3
KIRK,I'm scratched over sixty percent of my body.,3
LORELAI,"Aw, CatKirk again?",3
KIRK,Ow.,3
LORELAI,Sorry.,3
BABETTE,I'm so mad at that cat.,3
MOREY,Very uncool cat.,3
BABETTE,"I love cats, but I love Kirk, too. It's pretty much fifty-fifty, and that's a high compliment, my friend.",3
LORELAI,How did this happen?,3
KIRK,"Well, the tension of our standoff was unbearable, so I got on the floor and tried to play with him.",3
LORELAI,It's a him?,3
KIRK,I caught a peek.,3
LORELAI,Go on.,3
KIRK,I rolled this cute little ball of yarn over to him all nice and gentle. He tried to garrote me with it.,3
LORELAI,Oh my God.,3
MOREY,Very uncool.,3
KIRK,Just grabbed two ends with his paws and came at me.,3
RORY,But he doesn't have opposable thumbs.,3
KIRK,"He's beyond them. And he's smart. He knows things, sometimes before they happen.",3
LORELAI,"Get a hold of yourself, man.",3
KIRK,You haven't heard the worst.,3
RORY,"Oh geez, there's worse?",3
KIRK,"When the att*cks got particularly brutal, I had no choice but to strip naked and hide under water in the bathtub. I read that cats are afraid of water.",3
BABETTE,"They are, they are.",3
KIRK,"Kirk isn't. He found me, and he seemed to derive greater power from the water. That's when the bulk of the scratching happened.",3
LORELAI,"Well, then, I think it's good you're giving Kirk a little space right now. Just relax and enjoyyour food.",3
KIRK,I can't taste my food.,3
LORELAI,"Well, then, just try to relax.",3
KIRK,Thanks.,3
JESS,Hey.,3
RORY,Hey.,3
JESS,Hi.,3
LORELAI,"Hi, Happy Thanksgiving. So, are you joining us?",3
JESS,"Uh, sure, if that's okay.",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, sit, sit.",3
JESS,"God, I'm starved.",3
LUKE,You could've eaten.,3
JESS,You kept telling me not to eat.,3
LUKE,I did not.,3
JESS,"You did, too. You said you were waiting for them.",3
LORELAI,"Aw, you didn't have to wait for us.",3
LUKE,"I wasn't waiting for you, it just worked out this way.",3
JESS,Right.,3
RORY,Looks great.,3
LORELAI,Tasty.,3
LUKE,Shouldn't we give thanks first?,3
JESS,Thanks for what?,3
LUKE,"Well, that we're not Native Americans who got their land stolen in exchange for smallpox infested blankets.",3
LORELAI,Amen.,3
LUKE,So where you guys in your day?,3
RORY,"We hit the Kim's, we hit Sookie's, and we go to the grandparents from here.",3
LORELAI,Full day.,3
LUKE,"Yeah. Well, you can skip eating this one if you want. Just have cokes or something, it's no big deal.",3
LORELAI,"No, no way, you're the main event today, my friend.",3
LUKE,"Oh, good.",3
RORY,What's good are the yams.,3
LORELAI,Definitely. Got some mo re marshmallows?,3
LUKE,"Yeah, I can grab some. Hey, refill some coffees.",3
LORELAI,"So, no offense, but lame-o kiss.",3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,"You and Jess, like a couple chickens pecking at each other.",3
RORY,Mind your own business.,3
LORELAI,"Well, it was right in front of me.",3
RORY,"So, I don't need a review.",3
LORELAI,Sorry.,3
RORY,I'm just not good with the public displays.,3
LORELAI,You didn't have that problem with Dean.,3
RORY,"I know, but now I just feel like everybody's watching me.",3
LORELAI,People are not watching you.,3
RORY,You were watching me.,3
LORELAI,I created you. It's biologically predetermined that I watch you.,3
RORY,I just don't know how this whole second boyfriend thing is supposed to go.,3
LORELAI,"Well, he's your first second boyfriend. Give it time.",3
RORY,"The whole town got used to me w ith Dean, it's just weird.",3
LORELAI,It'll get easier. You're gonna have hundreds of men in your life.,3
RORY,"Gee, thanks.",3
LORELAI,"Well, maybe not hundreds, but a couple, three, more. It'll get easier.",3
RORY,I guess.,3
LORELAI,"Honey, they'll adjust to seeing you with Jess.",3
RORY,And then there's Dean. What do I do about him?,3
LORELAI,"Well, you know, he'll be moving on, too.",3
RORY,"Oh, right, of course he will, yeah.",3
BABETTE,"Well, we're outta here.",3
MOREY,Time to walk some of this off.,3
BABETTE,"Oh, we'd have to walk to China to walk all of it off. Which way's China?",3
LORELAI,Thataway. Have a good night.,3
BABETTE,"Thanks. By the way, that was some half-assed kiss you two had. You gotta give it a little something, honey.",3
LORELAI,Bye Babette. Bye Morey.,3
BABETTE,Bye.,3
RORY,,3
RORY,You ready for this?,3
LORELAI,Of course.,3
RORY,Even with the Cold w*r?,3
LORELAI,That's been going on for thirty-four years? I can manage.,3
RORY,It's been a bit colder these past few weeks.,3
LORELAI,"Oh no, I'm fine, you know why? Because in two hours   and I do plan on extricating us from here in exactly two hours   the night will be over and I won't have to see them again until next year. Oh, start your stopwatch.",3
EMILY,Hello.,3
RORY,Hi Grandma. Happy Thanksgiving.,3
EMILY,"Thank you, Rory. Happy Thanksgiving, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,"Happy Thanksgiving. One hour, fifty-nine minutes, and forty seconds.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, wow, it's a piano player.",3
EMILY,That's Brad. I found him at Nordstrom's.,3
LORELAI,Was he on sale?,3
EMILY,I thought a little background music would add a nice touch. He knows every song ever written.,3
LORELAI,Free Bird! Hi Brad.,3
EMILY,"Lorelai, please. Now come al ong, everyone's here. We're all here.",3
RICHARD,"Oh, good. Happy Thanksgiving, Rory.",3
RORY,"Happy Thanksgiving, Grandpa.",3
RICHARD,Lorelai.,3
LORELAI,Dad.,3
RICHARD,"These are our guests, Natalie and Douglas Swope.",3
EMILY,You two have met.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, at the auction.",3
NATALIE,Good to see you again.,3
LORELAI,Yes.,3
DOUGLAS,Nice to meet you.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, you, too.",3
RORY,Same here.,3
RICHARD,"And this is our international contingent, Claude and Monique Clemenceau. They're just in from France.",3
LORELAI,"Ah, Clemenceau, huh, I'd have guessed Spain.",3
CLAUDE,"Hello, how are you?",3
LORELAI,"Oh, ooh.",3
MONIQUE,Hello.,3
RICHARD,"Monique, voici ma fille et ma petite fille.",3
MONIQUE,Ah. Elle sont si jolies.,3
CLAUDE,"My Monique speaks only French, so please excuse the inconvenience.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, no, that's fine. I love French.",3
CLAUDE,"She really wants to learn English, perhaps tonight will inspire her. Je leur ai dit que tu voulais à prendre l'anglais.",3
MONIQUE,"L'anglais, oui, je veux à prendre, mais je suis tellement parasseuse.",3
RICHARD,"Ah, ça prends de temps, Monique. Ah, t'en fais pas.",3
MONIQUE,Merci.,3
RICHARD,"Oh, no no no. That's why I love it when the Clemenceaus visit. It gives me the opportunity to haul out my rusty French.",3
CLAUDE,"Your French is wonderful, Richard. It always has been.",3
RICHARD,"Aw, non, tu es tres gentil. Please, sit, sit, sit.",3
CLAUDE,"Merci. So, Rory, you speak French at all?",3
RORY,Just a tiny little bit.,3
CLAUDE,Un tout petite peu?,3
RORY,"Oui, un tout petite peu.",3
CLAUDE,"And you, my dear?",3
LORELAI,"Even less. Uh, voulez vous couchez avec moi ce soir? That's about it.",3
RICHARD,Lorelai.,3
EMILY,Oh my God.,3
LORELAI,It's just a joke.,3
RICHARD,Asking my friend to go to bed with you is a joke?,3
RORY,It's a song.,3
LORELAI,"It's just a joke, Dad.",3
CLAUDE,"Oh, voici c'est un chanson du pop. It's a pop song, ah, Monique. . . I did not know that.",3
MONIQUE,Lady Marmalade.,3
CLAUDE,"It's very rich. It's very, very funny.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, well, thank you.",3
CLAUDE,"You need a drink, oui?",3
LORELAI,"Very astute, Claude. Martini with a twist, Dad.",3
RICHARD,All right.,3
DOUGLAS,"Is this your first American Thanksgiving, Claude?",3
CLAUDE,"It is, it is. I've seen it in the movies. People seem to eat and eat and eat until they can't eat anymore.",3
LORELAI,That's about it.,3
NATALIE,"It's about giving thanks, gets you thinking about the good things.",3
DOUGLAS,We have a lot to give thanks for in this country.,3
EMILY,Definitely.,3
CLAUDE,"Me, I start each day giving thanks for three things   Cuban cigars, French champagne, and gorgeous women. And I must give extra thanks for the extraordinary group here tonight.",3
LORELAI,"Douglas, Richard, leave us, won't you?",3
RICHARD,What?,3
EMILY,Just another joke.,3
CLAUDE,"Oh, I missed another joke?",3
NATALIE,You have your mother's wit.,3
EMILY,Sometimes I wish she'd give it back.,3
DOUGLAS,Emily mentioned that you were coming from another function?,3
CLAUDE,"No, this is your second dinner?",3
RORY,"Fourth, actually.",3
NATALIE,Fourth?,3
RICHARD,"Oh, thank you for fitting us in, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,,3
NATALIE,"Beautiful table, Emily. You've outdone yourself yet again.",3
EMILY,"Oh, it's nothing.",3
RICHARD,"Well, is everyone settled? Is everyone comfy?",3
EVERYONE,Yes.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, Dad, we're fine.",3
RICHARD,"Well, then, let's get going.",3
NATALIE,Gorgeous.,3
DOUGLAS,"Oh, wonderful.",3
CLAUDE,Is it for us or the whole neighborhood?,3
NATALIE,Very nice.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, ho, who gets the big piece?",3
RICHARD,I'm sorry?,3
LORELAI,Aren't you supposed to keep carving?,3
RICHARD,That was strictly ceremonial.,3
LORELAI,Ceremonial?,3
EMILY,Ceremonial.,3
CLAUDE,Cérémonial.,3
MONIQUE,Cérémonial.,3
EMILY,"Please, start on the salads everyone.",3
LORELAI,"Is there anything ceremonial about the salads? Do we carve a crouton, then have them taken away?",3
EMILY,"No, no ceremony.",3
RORY,"Salad's great, Grandma.",3
EMILY,"I'm surprised you can eat at this point, even salad.",3
RORY,There's still room.,3
LORELAI,"And if there isn't room, we'll add on. I know a good contractor.",3
CLAUDE,"She's like your Jerry Lewis. She's very, very funny.",3
NATALIE,"Rory, did your grandmother say you were a high school senior?",3
RORY,Mmhmm.,3
NATALIE,So you're going through this horrible period of applying to college.,3
RORY,It's not so horrible.,3
RICHARD,She's got it pretty well covered.,3
LORELAI,That's right.,3
NATALIE,All your applications are in?,3
RORY,I've applied.,3
DOUGLAS,"We have a grandson your age, he's going through hell.",3
NATALIE,"He's already been turned down for early admission to Stanford, his dream.",3
DOUGLAS,Took it pretty hard.,3
NATALIE,Children put so much stress on themselves these days.,3
RORY,It's pretty stressful.,3
NATALIE,He's waiting to hear from his backups.,3
CLAUDE,"I have a grandson who lives with his mother in Orlando, you know, he's going through a very similar thing, poor boy.",3
EMILY,"How do they like Orlando, Claude?",3
CLAUDE,"Well, it's all Mickey Mouse this and Mickey Mouse that, you know. They want to die.",3
EMILY,That's too bad.,3
NATALIE,"Where did you apply, dear?",3
RORY,Harvard.,3
DOUGLAS,No word yet?,3
RORY,I'm not supposed to hear back for awhile.,3
DOUGLAS,Where else?,3
RORY,Where else?,3
DOUGLAS,Where else did you apply? Your alternates?,3
NATALIE,"We're so curious, it's like we've been going through this ourselves.",3
RORY,"Well, I'm pretty much counting on Harvard.",3
DOUGLAS,"Well, you didn't apply to just Harvard, did you?",3
RORY,"Well, no.",3
LORELAI,No?,3
NATALIE,Am I prying?,3
RORY,No.,3
LORELAI,We applied elsewhere?,3
DOUGLAS,You can't just apply to one place.,3
NATALIE,Chilton wouldn't allow that.,3
LORELAI,Is that true?,3
RORY,Pretty much.,3
LORELAI,Why didn't you tell me that?,3
RORY,I was going to.,3
NATALIE,You have to be safe.,3
CLAUDE,My grandson   six schools.,3
DOUGLAS,Same w ith Dustin.,3
LORELAI,Where else did you apply?,3
RORY,Just at some other schools.,3
DOUGLAS,"Well, if you're aiming at Harvard, that would be Princeton, Yale, maybe Vassar, Wesleyan.",3
CLAUDE,"Certainly Yale because of Richard's connections, yes?",3
NATALIE,I would assume so.,3
RORY,"Those are the kinds of places, yup.",3
LORELAI,The kinds of places or the places? Rory?,3
RORY,"Princeton. . . um, Yale.",3
LORELAI,Yale?,3
RICHARD,Yes?,3
LORELAI,"Yale, Dad?",3
RICHARD,"Oh, this is the first I'm hearing about it, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, bull.",3
RORY,Mom.,3
EMILY,Lorelai.,3
LORELAI,You did this.,3
RICHARD,I haven't discussed this awful subject since the debacle at the campus.,3
LORELAI,You forced her hand.,3
RICHARD,I did nothing of the sort.,3
RORY,"Mom, wait.",3
LORELAI,"You made it seem like you'd be deeply hurt if she didn't apply to Yale, and she's verysensitive, so that's as good as forcing her hand.",3
EMILY,"Lorelai, really.",3
LORELAI,"You wanted her to go to Yale instead of Harvard, didn't you?",3
RICHARD,"Well, that wasn't a secret.",3
CLAUDE,Lorelai ne veut pas que Rory aille à Yale.,3
RICHARD,Je suis désolé de ce qui ce passe ici.,3
LORELAI,"Stick to English, Dad.",3
RORY,Grandpa didn't force my hand.,3
LORELAI,"Honey, you weren't aware he was doing it.",3
RICHARD,"She is not a puppet, Lorelai.",3
RORY,I needed a backup.,3
LORELAI,But why Yale?,3
RORY,I could live at home.,3
LORELAI,You.,3
EMILY,What?,3
LORELAI,"Well, you got to her. That was your thing.",3
NATALIE,I'm afraid we started this.,3
EMILY,"This is not your doing, Natalie.",3
RICHARD,"Encore une fois, je suis désolé.",3
EMILY,I never spoke to Rory about that.,3
LORELAI,I don't believe you.,3
RORY,"I figured it out on my own, Mom.",3
LORELAI,"You're saying there have been no conversations, no emails?",3
RORY,I can read a map.,3
LORELAI,This is unbelievable.,3
RICHARD,And past indelicate. We have guests.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, I'm sorry, I apologize, I'm sorry you have to see this.",3
EMILY,"This is paranoia, Lorelai. There's been no conspiring.",3
LORELAI,"I'm not being paranoid, Mom. For seventeen years, she was going to Harvard, and now all of a sudden, she's applied to Yale and she's mimicking everything you say. This is just crazy.",3
CLAUDE,"Elle a dit que,  c'est de la folie.'",3
EMILY,,3
EMILY,It's freezing out here.,3
LORELAI,It's Jamaica compared to in there.,3
EMILY,"It's just an alternative to Harvard, a backup. It changes nothing.",3

LANE,The whole night. I had no idea she'd make you play five straight hours without a break.,3
DAVE,It's okay.,3
LANE,Your hands must be dead.,3
DAVE,"They're just a little numb. But I've got these Kurt Cobain calluses now, how cool is that?",3
LANE,"But this whole thing, this whole charade, the fake flier and everything, it was too much.",3
DAVE,"Lane, it's fine. And that flier   I've gotten like three other calls for paying gigs. I should be paying you a commis sion.",3
LANE,"Oh, that's not necessary.",3
DAVE,And check it out   twenty bucks.,3

It's gonna be awesome, and you're gonna come out on the other side an even more amazing you. But I just wish my head could sit down and have a chat with that gnawing feeling in my gut that's there every time my parents get involved in anything and tell it, it's gonna be okay.",3
RORY,It's gonna be okay.,3
LORELAI,Nice try.,3
JACKSON,"What else are we putting in the pot? Come on, let's think of something. Uh, a raspberry, a deep-fried raspberry. How  bout a rasquat?",3

SOOKIE,"Vegetables, mashed potatoes, butter, pickles, salt, a napkin.",3
RORY,"And yet, you're very serene.",3
LORELAI,"Uh, you're practically floating.",3
SOOKIE,"Well, you caught me at a good time, ladies. I've already gone through the five stages of grieving. Denial, anger. . .I don't rememb er these two, but they were served on the rocks with salt! Now, I'm just happily enscotched in acceptance. Enscotched. . .",3
RORY,Ensconced?,3
SOOKIE,Ensconced   that's it! I do believe I heard Phil suggest throwing Junior in.,3

SOOKIE,His nephew.,3
LORELAI,Whoa.,3
SOOKIE,I chimed in on that one.,3
LORELAI,What happened over there?,3
SOOKIE,"Mm, about a half-hour ago they set the lawn on fire.",3
LORELAI,Ah.,3
SOOKIE,"But Phil says it's okay and everything  cause it'll grow back twice as lush. Though that's what he said when he broke my salad bowl that I brought back from Belgium. That'll maybe grow back, too, huh? Phil is a riot. Am I crying or laughing?",3
LORELAI,Laughing.,3
SOOKIE,Good.,3
LORELAI,Who's that?,3
RORY,It's Lane. It just says  bible kiss bible'.,3

LUKE,I don't need more.,3
JESS,You make me run around town for a place to dump this.,3
LUKE,Just dump it in one of Taylor's bins. It gets it out of here and it'll drive Taylor crazy. It's a win- win.,3
LORELAI,Hi guys.,3
LUKE,We're out of food.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, please, we're not eating for a year.",3

DEAN,"What's the matter, Jess? Why you walking away?",3
JESS,"It's getting a little West Side Story here, Dean, and I gotta warn you, my dancing skills are not up to snuff.",3
DEAN,"But now's your chance, there's no one else around.",3
JESS,Go home. Cool off.,3
DEAN,"Come on, make one of your Boy Scout references, or a good Farmer John joke. I got my Doose's Market apron with me   you want me to put it on, give you a little inspiration? I don't get it, what happened   you suddenly like me now?",3
JESS,"Oh yeah, I was just about to invite you camping.",3
DEAN,"Good, okay, now we're getting somewhere.",3
JESS,"I'm not gonna fight you, Dean.",3
DEAN,Why?,3
JESS," Cause if I fight you, Rory's gonna think it's my fault, so just forget it, okay? Just forget it. Go home. Let it rest.",3
DEAN,"So Rory's got a nice little hold on you now, huh?",3
JESS,Geez. Don't do that.,3
DEAN,How does it feel?,3
JESS,It feels like I'm with Rory and you're not.,3
DEAN,,3
LUKE,"So, how did the four dinners work out? You guys must feel more stuffed than you've ever been.",3
LORELAI,I don't know. Is this more stuffed than the great Six Flags hot dog consumption of  99?,3
RORY,"No, or the taffy binge of '97.",3
LORELAI,"Not by a long shot. See, we didn't eat at my parents because of the upset, so we really had three dinners, not four.",3
RORY,Which means. . .,3
LORELAI,What?,3
RORY,We didn't have to skip rolls.,3
LORELAI,"Oh yeah. Hey, do you have any rolls left?",3
LUKE,No. Come on.,3

LANE,So not funny.,3
Posted,01/26/03 05:59,3
RORY,Raising money for the marching band to do what?,3
LORELAI,Please let it be new uniforms.,3
LANE,"It's for letters so we can finally have letter carriers. For some reason, the powers that be think that the reason we never win at competitions is because no one knows who we are. The fact that we suck has never occurred to them. What's wrong with our uniforms?",3
LORELAI,Nothing.,3
LANE,"We look stupid, right?",3
LORELAI,No.,3
LANE,"The plumes are too big, and it looks like big red fountains of blood spurting out of our heads.",3
LORELAI,I love the uniforms.,3
LANE,It's bad enough I have to be in marching band at all without being mocked for what is mandatory for us to wear.,3
LORELAI,"No, no, no, I didn't mean, I. . .remind her that she gets to rehearse in our garage  cause I think I'm losing points here.",3
RORY,"Your uniforms are great, and people knowing who you are can only help. Now let's just enjoy the snow, okay?",3
LANE,Okay.,3
LORELAI,Okay.,3
RORY,Especially since some of us have been freezing since our showers this morning.,3
LORELAI,I wasn't in there that long.,3

TEACHERory,"To evaluate the value of a function of X when X equals pi. You want to start by splitting the intregal into two separate intregals. Now, since the left intregal is a variable of a constant exponent, rememb er C is a constant, add one and divide by the new power.",3
MADELINE,"Paris, what did he say?",3
PARIS,Hm?,3
MADELINE,"He's talking too fast, I missed it.",3
PARIS,Ask Louise.,3
MADELINE,"Louise, what did he say?",3
LOUISE,"I don't know, ask Paris.",3
MADELINE,She told me to ask you.,3
LOUISE,Why would she do that?,3
MADELINE,I don't know.,3
LOUISE,Did you guys have a fight?,3
MADELINE,Not that I know of.,3
TEACHERory,". . . The right intregal, however, is more complex. You have to use U substitution with U equals 3 feet. We'll pick up at the same place tomorrow.",3
RORY,The bell rang.,3
PARIS,What?,3
RORY,The bell? That loud metal musical contraption that when hit loudly by a vibrating mallet signals the end of this particular educational experience.,3
PARIS,Class is over?,3
RORY,Yup.,3
PARIS,What did he talk about?,3
MADELINE,Ask Louise.,3
PARIS,I didn't take notes. I didn't pay attention. I'm going to. . .,3
RORY,Borrow my notes and be just fine.,3
PARIS,Thank you.,3
MADELINE,"Madeline want notes, too, please.",3
LOUISE,"Add one and divide by the new power? Oh, I thought it said add one and divide by the Jew power. It makes much more sense this way.",3
PARIS,I can't believe I zoned out for the entire class.,3
RORY,You must have a lot on your mind.,3
PARIS,I do.,3
RORY,"I'm sure. Okay, so, onto the next thing. I don't think I'll have the prom bids ready for the supplemental student council meet ing this week.",3
PARIS,Oh.,3
RORY,"They need a little more time to get the details together, so that leaves a little hole in our agenda. Any thoughts?",3
PARIS,"Well, we can just cancel the supplementary meeting this week.",3
RORY,What?,3
PARIS,"Well, if there's nothing really to talk about, what's the point, right?",3
LOUISE,You said that one student council meeting a week was not enough.,3
MADELINE,"Yeah, you said that was no way to govern, that meeting once a week was lazy, ineffectual, and if we were going to do it like that, we might as well just buy ourselves a ranch in Texas.",3
PARIS,"Fine, if you guys wanna sit around for an hour after school swapping makeover horror stories, then count me in . Hey, did I ever tell you about the time I plucked outside of my designated brow line? Man, was my face red.",3
MADELINE,"I've done that, too. Ooh, it's bad.",3
LOUISE,She was being sarcastic.,3
MADELINE,"Well, I wasn't. I looked surprised for a month.",3
PARIS,"We'll just take this week off, and next week we'll go back to twice a week, okay?",3
RORY,Sounds fair.,3
LOUISE,Sounds fab.,3
FRANCIE,"I heard something about the supplemental student council meeting   anything I need to know about, a new chart to be made, perhaps?",3
PARIS,"No. We were just saying that the agenda seems light this week, so I've decided to cancel it, and we can just gather at the regular meeting on Friday.",3
FRANCIE,"Wow, this is quite a change in plans.",3
PARIS,You have a problem with it?,3
FRANCIE,"No, I'm just surprised. You seem so attached to those meetings.",3
PARIS,"Well, I finally got a blankie. It's much better.",3
FRANCIE,"Okay, no extra meet ing this week. What will I do with all that extra time? Well, I guess I'll think of something.",3
PARIS,"Take a picture of which outfit wins, will ya?",3
RORY,Bye Francie.,3
FRANCIE,Bye.,3
PARIS,I met his parents.,3
RORY,You did?,3
PARIS,"He bought me a t icket, and I took the train to Philadelphia, and he met me at the station, and I spent Christmas with him and his family.",3
RORY,Sounds nice.,3
PARIS,"No, not nice. It was perfect. They had a Christmas tree twelve feet tall. Everything was red and silver and there was eggnog. Have you ever had eggnog?",3
RORY,"Yes, I have.",3
PARIS,It's disgusting.,3
RORY,"Yes, it is.",3
PARIS,"But disgusting in a really great way. And they had tiny wreaths hanging from every doorknob, and mistletoe and candles everywhere. I couldn't believe it. I mean, I've never had a Christmas before. One year, I asked my mother if we could get a Chanukah bush. She made me watch Shoah the rest of the week.",3
RORY,Wow.,3
PARIS,"The place smelled like cinnamon all the time, and there was a fire in the fireplace, and a ton of presents. I mean, hundreds of presents. I'm looking at this mound of gifts, and I'm thinking,  Eight days of Chanukah. . . who was the skinflint who thought up that deal?'",3
RORY,Don't the eight days symbolize something?,3
PARIS,"Yes, they symbolize eight days of ripping off the little kids who can't have a Chanukah bush.",3
RORY,You're making me sad.,3
PARIS,His mother bought me a p resent.,3
RORY,"Well, that says something.",3
PARIS,What does it say?,3
RORY,It says that Jamie likes you enough that she felt compelled to buy you a present.,3
PARIS,"I had the most amazing time. Sitting around the tree opening presents, and they played Christmas music and we drank apple cider. . .it was so nice. And then his grandfather and I wound up in a theological discussion. Jesus   Messiah or nice Jewish kid with a hammer? It got pretty heated.",3
RORY,"Okay, skip to the end, I can't take it. How did it turn out?",3
PARIS,He told me he loved me.,3
RORY,"Aw, Paris!",3
PARIS,I never thought I'd hear a boy tell me he loved me.,3
RORY,That's great.,3

EMILY,I had just started planning the whole thing when he came home in a mood and declared that parties were for children and it was canceled.,3
LORELAI,Were we disappointed?,3
EMILY,"However, today he came in and changed his mind, so I expect the two of you at eight. And bring a gift, but don't get him a cigar humidor.",3
LORELAI,Okay.,3
EMILY,I bought him a cigar humidor.,3
LORELAI,I assumed.,3
EMILY,"It's gorgeous. It belonged to a lieutenant in the army in World w*r I. Apparently, he kept it in his field office in France. There are carvings in the bottom that the dealer said could possibly be coded messages.",3

DEAN,I see. And what are you planning to do now that you've got him trapped?,3
LORELAI,"Well, I was thinking of just giving him the kitchen.",3
DEAN,Okay.,3

DEAN,I could get rid of it if you want.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, that'd be great. Just, careful . . . He heard me talking, so don't let him get away. He knows I'm behind this, he'll come af ter me. Ugh, ugh, ugh. I guess you can see why camping's completely out of the question for me.",3

LORELAI,"Well, Dean coming over, bringing your stuff back.",3
RORY,"No, I'm fine.",3
LORELAI,"Okay. Although, you know, if you were weirded out a little, it would be okay. It wouldn't mean that you don't like Jess, or that you made a mistake. It would just mean the guy who was in your life for two years isn't there anymore.",3
RORY,"I was just surprised, that's all.",3

JESS,I don't go to these stupid town things.,3

RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,The fact that I totally suck at buying my father presents.,3
RORY,He'll like whatever you get him.,3
LORELAI,"If I slip him a quaalude, he'll like whatever I get him.",3
RORY,They are not that bad.,3
LORELAI,"My intentions are always good, and I never put a price limit on it. I even went so far as to follow older men around the store who kind of looked like my dad to see what they were buying, which didn't help me w ith ideas, but I did get asked to the antique car show.",3
RORY,Just show me w hat you got.,3
LORELAI,"Fine. Option number one   a state of the art, high tech, titanium bathroom scale.",3
RORY,Huh.,3
LORELAI,What? He has weight.,3
RORY,"Yes, but I'm not sure that his birthday is the time to remind him of it.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, option number two   a fabulous mechanical coin sorter. You put the coins in, it sorts them. What?",3
RORY,"Well, it's a little generic.",3
LORELAI,"Generic in a good way, or. . .",3
RORY,What's the third option?,3
LORELAI,"See, I should have pulled the coin sorter out last,  cause. . .",3

LORELAI,What'd you get him?,3
RORY,Nothing big.,3

RORY,Just a thing.,3
LORELAI,What kind of thing?,3
RORY,Chuck Berry Live at the Fillmore on vinyl.,3
LORELAI,"Oh my God, that's perfect. He loves Chuck Berry. How did you come up with that?",3
RORY,I called him and asked him what he wanted.,3
LORELAI,That's cheating.,3
RORY,Tough.,3
LORELAI,"Well, now what am I gonna do? I can't give him a tie when you give him the world's most perfect present we already know he likes.",3
RORY,You want me to go find something for you?,3
LORELAI,You would do that?,3
RORY,He gave me a c ouple other suggestions. I can go see if I can find one of them.,3
LORELAI,"Ugh, my God, I love you. You are my angel.",3
RORY,"Hey, you had one more that you didn't show me.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah   it lights up and sings.",3
RORY,,3
RORY,Oh!,3
DEAN,"Oh, sorry.",3
RORY,I didn't see you.,3
DEAN,I wasn't paying attention.,3
RORY,I was just looking in the window and then. . .,3
DEAN,I was just noticing the new benches in the square.,3
RORY,Sorry.,3
DEAN,"Yeah, uh, sorry.",3
RORY,It's weird.,3
DEAN,What's weird?,3
RORY,How we keep randomly bumping into each other like this.,3
DEAN,"Well, it wasn't exactly random bumping into you at your house.",3
RORY,"Right, I live there, not so random.",3
DEAN,"Though, this, right now. .",3
RORY,Random.,3
DEAN,Very random.,3
RORY,That's probably the most the word random's been used in a two minutes period in a reallylong time.,3
DEAN,"Hey, you wanna get a cup of coffee?",3
RORY,Coffee?,3
DEAN,"Maybe talk a little? Of course, if you prefer, we can both just head over to Weston's and randomly bump into each other.",3
RORY,"No, uh, that's okay. I can get coffee.",3
DEAN,,3
DEAN,"So, where do you wanna sit?",3
RORY,"Um, there's good, if you like the window.",3
DEAN,Window is fine.,3
RORY,"Of course, there's that one if you don't like the window.",3
DEAN,Window's fine.,3
RORY,"The window can be colder because of the glass, but then that one is right by the bathroom, and being right by the bathroom always makes me kind of uncomfortable, which isn't really fair because something has to be right by the bathroom. Otherwise, you're cutting down on tables, which means you're cutting down on profits and. . .window's fine?",3
DEAN,Window's fine.,3
RORY,Let's sit down then. This is a very nice table. Good pick.,3
KIRK,"Today we have an almond tort, an apple pandowdy, and various marzipan fruits made by a sect of cloistered nuns in Toledo.",3
DEAN,I'll have a piece of pie.,3
KIRK,"Cherry, peach, chocolate, pumpkin, custard  ",3
DEAN,Custard's fine.,3
KIRK,There's more.,3
DEAN,"I know, but custard's fine.",3
KIRK,You don't wanna hear the rest?,3
DEAN,I am really good with the custard.,3
KIRK,But they made memo rize thirty different flavors.,3
DEAN,Kirk?,3
KIRK,Yes?,3
DEAN,Custard is fine.,3
KIRK,You want ice cream with that?,3
DEAN,Are there different flavors?,3
KIRK,Thirty-two.,3
DEAN,Just the pie.,3
KIRK,Okay. What about you?,3
RORY,"Oh, nothing for me.",3
DEAN,Nothing?,3
RORY,I'm not hungry.,3
DEAN,You're not hungry?,3
RORY,"Nope, I'm not.",3
DEAN,She's not hungry.,3
KIRK,I'll be right back.,3
DEAN,"In all the time I've known you, I've never seen you not hungry.",3
RORY,"Yeah, well. . .",3
DEAN,Thanks for doing this.,3
RORY,Of course. Why wouldn't I?,3
DEAN,Because you're incredibly uncomfortable.,3
RORY,"Well, it's the situation, not you.",3
DEAN,"Yeah, the situation.",3
RORY,"You know, with you and me being. . .",3
DEAN,"Yeah, yeah, I know the situation. So, um, how are ya?",3
RORY,I'm fine. You?,3
DEAN,I'm doing okay.,3
RORY,How's school?,3
DEAN,Not bad. I've got McKellan for History.,3
RORY,"Oh, has he done his Napoleon having dinner with Charlemagne bit yet?",3
DEAN,Catherine the Great shows up for dessert.,3
RORY,"Oh, wow, he's revised it. Good for him. He's a unique man, but a decent teacher.",3
DEAN,"Yeah. You know, um, I wanted to tell you I applied to Southern Connecticut State.",3
RORY,What?,3
DEAN,McKellan actually wrote me a l etter of recommendation.,3
RORY,Wait a minute   you do know that Southern Connecticut State is a four-year college?,3
DEAN,"Yeah, I read that in the brochure.",3
RORY,But what happened to  I'm going to community college'?,3
DEAN,I changed my mind.,3
RORY,Why?,3
DEAN,You.,3
RORY,Me?,3
DEAN,"All your Harvard talk, all those crazy books you pushed on me, all that talk about  you can do more.'",3
RORY,You can do more.,3
DEAN,So I decided to do more.,3
RORY,"Wow, I'm so glad.",3
DEAN,Thanks.,3
RORY,"Well, if you need any help with anything, I've become the Rain Man of college application requirements.",3
DEAN,Thanks. I might take you up on that.,3
KIRK,"Custard pie, no ice cream.",3
DEAN,"Thanks, Kirk.",3
RORY,"Wow. Southern Connecticut State, that's exciting. When did all this happen?",3
DEAN,"The last few weeks. Uh, it's funny. I got the envelope, and I wanted to call you, and then I realized, uh, I can't do that.",3
RORY,You could've done that.,3
DEAN,"I guess. I don't know, I can't get over how weird it is. I go from seeing you everyday to. . .",3
RORY,I know.,3
DEAN,"I mean, I'm used to talking to you.",3
RORY,I know.,3
DEAN,That's a hard thing to just let go of.,3
RORY,"For me, too.",3
DEAN,"I don't know, Rory. Maybe. . .maybe, um. . .is there a way we could be friends?",3
RORY,Really?,3
DEAN,If you want to.,3
RORY,"Oh, I want to. I really want to. But  ",3
DEAN,Don't ask me how I'm gonna deal with him. I have no idea.,3
RORY,Okay.,3
DEAN,Let's just take this one step at a time.,3
RORY,Absolutely. Slow and steady wins the race.,3
DEAN,This is really good. You sure you don't want a bite?,3
RORY,One bite. So how's Clara's horseback-riding lessons going?,3
DEAN,Not bad. I think she actually got within three feet of the thing last week.,3
RORY,"Hm, very impressive.",3
DEAN,,3
RICHARD,This man is a genius. Listen to him play.,3
RORY,"I'm glad you like it, Grandpa.",3
RICHARD,"Oh, I must say, I am a very spoiled man. Chuck Berry, and the complete history of the Peloponnesian w*r.",3
LORELAI,"Well, sure,  cause a partial history would skip all the dirty stuff.",3
RICHARD,"I especially like the way you wrapped the books in a bow tie. It's very, very clever.",3
LORELAI,I thought it would be appropriate.,3
EMILY,"And, of course, you're not forgetting your favorite gift.",3
RICHARD,"Oh, yes, my beautiful humidor from my beautiful wife.",3
EMILY,Thank you.,3
RICHARD,"No, thank you. It's been a wonderful birthday.",3
EMILY,Would you like some mo re champagne?,3
RICHARD,"Oh, why not?",3
TRIX,One of the porch lights is burned out. Perhaps the simple act of glancing outside a window once in awhile might have alerted someone to the situation.,3
LORELAI,Gran?,3
RICHARD,"Trix, is that you? Well, I'll be. What a surprise.",3
LORELAI,"Mom, did you know Grandma was coming?",3
EMILY,Oh my God.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, no seems like a safe answer.",3
RICHARD,"Emily, come here! Come say hello to this delightful creature that just walked in.",3
EMILY,Oh my God.,3
LORELAI,"Come on, let's see if she tries to make a break for it.",3
RICHARD,"Emily, did you know about this?",3
EMILY,"Why, no, I didn't.",3
RICHARD,"Well, I'm floored.",3
TRIX,Good. Hello Lorelai.,3
LORELAI,"Hello Gran, good to see you.",3
TRIX,You're well?,3
LORELAI,I'm well.,3
TRIX,You're working?,3
LORELAI,I'm working.,3
TRIX,You're single?,3
LORELAI,I'm single.,3
TRIX,"By choice, or do you scare the men with your independence?",3
LORELAI,"Actually, I scare them with my Minnie Pearl impression.",3
TRIX,"The lady with the hat. Rory, as soon as I get settled, I want to hear all about your schooling and your college plans.",3
RORY,"Okay, Gran.",3
TRIX,"Well, Emily, I don't know if you realize it or not, but it's not proper to receive guests in the foyer. It puts one in the awkward position of having to invite oneself in.",3
EMILY,"Uh, yes, uh, please, I - I'm sorry. Please, come in.",3
RICHARD,This way.,3
EMILY,What is she doing here?,3
LORELAI,She's visiting.,3
EMILY,"She didn't call, she always calls.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, it's Dad's birthday. She wanted it to be a surprise.",3
EMILY,"But I haven't prepared. I haven't shopped or set up the guest room and   oh God, her horrible gifts are still in the basement. What do I do?",3
LORELAI,Leave them there.,3
EMILY,But  ,3
LORELAI,It's too late to do anything about that now. Come on.,3
TRIX,"Oh, Emily, you're still here.",3
EMILY,"Yes, of course I'm still here. Can I get you some champagne?",3
TRIX,"Well, if you wish me to be violently ill tomorrow, absolutely.",3
LORELAI,Do not answer that.,3
RICHARD,"I've got you covered Trix. Now, tell me what on earth you're doing here. You didn't travel all the way from England just for my birthday.",3
TRIX,"Oh, I think your birthday is a good enough reason to travel all the way from England. However, it did also happen to coincide with some business I needed to attend to.",3
RORY,What kind of business?,3
TRIX,"Well, for the past year, I've been renting my home in Hartford to a group of musicians. They've recently moved out, so I had to come check on the house and secure a new tenant.",3
LORELAI,What kind of musicians?,3
TRIX,A rock and roll group of some sort. I believe they call themselves Korn.,3
LORELAI,You rented your house to Korn?,3
RORY,That's so cool!,3
TRIX,They were fine tenants. Took wonderful care of the place. They planted some lovely tulips in the front yard.,3
EMILY,"So, Mom, if you're going to be here for awhile, I can plan some things for you to do, some outings you might enjoy.",3
TRIX,Like what?,3
EMILY,Like the arboretum.,3
TRIX,"I have no desire to spend the entire day with plants, Emily. I'm not a bee. Besides, I already know what I would like to do. I would like to see where Lorelai works.",3
LORELAI,The inn?,3
TRIX,I thought we could all have dinner there.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, well, sure. That would be great.",3
TRIX,"Wonderful. Tomorrow night, then.",3
RORY,Oh. . .,3
LORELAI,Well. . .,3
TRIX,What?,3
LORELAI,It's just that tomorrow night we were planning to go to this winter carnival at the high school. . .,3
RORY,But we can skip it.,3
TRIX,"Absolutely not. Rory, you're a young person who works hard. It's equally important to have fun. You go to the carnival.",3
RORY,Thank you.,3
TRIX,"Lorelai, you've had enough fun in your life.",3
LORELAI,And then some.,3
TRIX,"Dinner will be for the grown-ups. Now, how is the birthday going?",3
RICHARD,"Wonderfully. They're spoiling me rotten. Emily got me the most beautiful humidor. It's from 1917, and was owned by a lieutenant in World w*r I.",3
TRIX,"You know, your father had a humidor that was owned by Victor Hugo.",3
RICHARD,Really?,3
TRIX,I still have it if you'd like it.,3
RICHARD,"Well, I'd love it.",3
TRIX,"Fine. I'll take care of it as soon as I get back to London. Now, if you will excuse me, I should like to freshen up.",3
EMILY,I'll make sure the guest room's ready.,3
RICHARD,"Oh, I can do that, Emily.",3
TRIX,"Thank you, Richard. Emily, I expect to return in twenty minutes. That should give you enough time to pull my gifts out of storage and place them around the room as if they actually stand there all year.",3
LORELAI,You want some help with those gifts?,3
EMILY,,3
SOOKIE,"Twelve courses, each paired with a specific wine, and for dessert, individual chocolate amaretto mousse cakes in the shape of a G.",3
LORELAI,"Sookie, look what you've done.",3
SOOKIE,Over the top?,3
LORELAI,On a monumental scale.,3
SOOKIE,Exactly what I was going for. I'm also going to have individual little menus printed up and placed at each setting.,3
LORELAI,I love you for doing this.,3
MICHELorelai,Your mother is on the phone.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, can you take a message?",3
MICHELorelai,"You mean, do I have the physical and mental capabilities to take a message? Why, yes, I do, however. . .",3
LORELAI,I got it. Hey Mom.,3
EMILY,She wants to see your house.,3
LORELAI,What?,3
EMILY,"Tonight, before the dinner.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, okay.",3
EMILY,Okay? Did you hear what I said? That horrifying woman wants to see your house. Your house   the one with the monkey lamp.,3
LORELAI,"Mom, relax.",3
EMILY,Is it clean?,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, it's clean.",3
EMILY,"If I came in there wearing white gloves, what would I find?",3
LORELAI,That you could pull a rabbit out of your hat?,3
EMILY,"I don't know what to do. Oh, nevermind, I'll just figure it out when I get there.",3
LORELAI,When you get where?,3
EMILY,"I'll call you later, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,"When you get where, Mom?",3
EMILY,I'm turning onto your street now.,3
LORELAI,"Mom, no!",3
EMILY,I'll just let myself in. I know you keep a key in the turtle or some ridiculous thing like that.,3
LORELAI,"Mom, I beg of you, make a very dangerous u-turn right now and go back where you came from.",3
EMILY,"I'm here. I'll talk to you later, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,,3
FRANCIE,"Oh, Rory, super. Could you step in here for a sec?",3
RORY,"Oh, okay.",3
FRANCIE,Thanks. I'm just so lucky I caught you.,3
RORY,What is this?,3
FRANCIE,"The supplementary student council meeting, silly.",3
RORY,But Paris canceled that.,3
FRANCIE,"She did, didn't she? Hm.",3
RORY,What's going on?,3
LOUISE,You tell us.,3
RORY,I don't know.,3
MADELINE,Francie said there was an issue that has to be discussed.,3
LOUISE,We figured you ok'ed it.,3
RORY,"I did not okay it. Mr. Hunter, there's been a mistake. Paris canceled this meeting and   MR.",3
HUNTERory,"I know, Rory, but Francie approached me and said there was an issue that she had planned to discuss at the meet ing today, and it has a bit of a ticking clock on it.",3
RORY,You did not mention that you had anything.,3
FRANCIE,I was just so surprised that Paris was canceling the meeting that it flew right out of my head. It was New York to London in three hours or less.,3
RORY,I'll bet. MR.,3
HUNTERory,"Rory, if you take a seat, we can get started.",3
RORY,I move that we postpone this meeting until Paris can be reached. MR.,3
HUNTERory,"We're all here now, let's just hear what Francie has to say. You can fill Paris in later. By the way, did anyone try to find her?",3
FRANCIE,"I saw her walking off with. . .who was that, her brother?",3
LOUISE,Paris doesn't have a brother.,3
FRANCIE,"Really? Well, she certainly seemed to know him.",3
RORY,"Francie, why don't you just tell us all why we're here?",3
LOUISE,And how long we're staying.,3
FRANCIE,"The Wadsworth Mansion has just had a cancellation, which means that we can get it for prom, if we move quickly. Shall we vote?",3
RORY,Hold on   the Wadsworth Mansion is too expensive. We've already discussed this.,3
FRANCIE,There are plenty of funds there to cover it.,3
RORY,Not if we want a telescope to be the senior gift.,3
FRANCIE,"You mean, not if Paris wants a telescope to be the senior gift.",3
RORY,We all thought it was a good idea.,3
FRANCIE,"Reach for the stars? Nice theme, original. Was  Be all that you can be' taken?",3
RORY,It's a good gift.,3
FRANCIE,"It's a fine gift. However, so is planting a nice tree in the quad.",3
RORY,Every class plants a tree.,3
FRANCIE,"Well, then, who are we to judge those who came before? I say, let's put it to a vote.",3
RORY,This isn't right. Paris should be here.,3
FRANCIE,"I agree, Paris should be here. However, she's not, so once again, shall we vote?MR.",3
HUNTERory,"Rory, as student body vice president, I need you to call for a vote.",3
RORY,"All those in favor of using the funds for the Wadsworth Mansion, even though we will be cheating the next generation of Chilton students who would love a nice telescope, say aye.",3
ALLorelai,Aye.,3
RORY,Wadsworth Mansion it is.,3
FRANCIE,,3
LORELAI,Hold it right there! Step back and move away from the couch.,3
EMILY,This couch cannot stay.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, it can.",3
EMILY,It's awful.,3
LORELAI,It can hear you.,3
EMILY,Please.,3
LORELAI,No.,3
EMILY,"Well, what about the chair? Let me move the chair.",3
LORELAI,"No, the chair stays also.",3
EMILY,"Well, we have to do something. I brought flowers over and can't find a decent vase. All I could find was a ceramic Betty Boop head.",3
LORELAI,"Mom, you're making yourself crazy.",3
EMILY,I know. We'll get some tarps and throw them over everything and tell her that you're painting.,3
LORELAI,"Mom, stop it. What is so horrible about this room?",3
EMILY,"Well, look at it.",3
LORELAI,I am. I like it.,3
EMILY,"Well, you may like it, but your grandmother will not. She's going to take one look around here at the junk store collection of hobo furniture and she's going to blame me.",3
LORELAI,For what?,3
EMILY,For letting you live like this. For not teaching you better. For not redecorating while you're out of town.,3
LORELAI,"Well, we're never out of town.",3
EMILY,For not sending you out of town so I could redecorate!,3
LORELAI,"Mom, you don't believe that.",3
EMILY,"Everything that's wrong in your life is my fault. Everything that's wrong in your father's life is my fault. Basically, everything's that wrong is my fault.",3
LORELAI,"Mom, would you sit down for a minute.",3
EMILY,"And it's lumpy, perfect.",3
LORELAI,"Mom, if I may, I'd like to give you some advice.",3
EMILY,You would?,3
LORELAI,You need to develop a defense mechanism for dealing with Grandma.,3
EMILY,What are you talking about?,3
LORELAI,"You just need a system, a new mindset. Take me, for example.",3
EMILY,What about you?,3
LORELAI,"Well, I know there are many things in my life you don't approve of.",3
EMILY,Like what?,3
LORELAI,Like this couch.,3
EMILY,"Well, this couch is terrible.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, good   you think the couch is terrible. Now, at one point in my life, you saying a couch that I carefully picked out and had to pay off over eight months is terrible might've hurt my feelings, but not anymore.",3
EMILY,No?,3
LORELAI,No.,3
EMILY,Why not?,3
LORELAI,"Because one day, I decided that instead of being hurt and upset by your disapproval, I'm gonna be amused. I'm gonna find it funny. I'm even going to take a little bit of pleasure in it.",3
EMILY,You take pleasure in my disapproval?,3
LORELAI,I encourage it sometimes just for a laugh.,3
EMILY,I don't know what to think of that.,3
LORELAI,"Think,  hey, that's brilliant', because this idea could set you free.",3
LORELAI,"Mom, what are you thinking about?",3
EMILY,That ridiculous Betty Boop head.,3
LORELAI,,3
RORY,"Francie, so good of you to stop by. I know how busy you are. Gum?",3
FRANCIE,"What's your damage, Gilmore?",3
RORY,Damage? No damage. I just thought we should chat.,3
FRANCIE,"Yeah? Well, I don't have any ",3
RORY,"Oh, you know what, I changed my mind. I don't think we should chat, I think I should chat. Ready? Okay. That little stunt you pulled   not good.",3
FRANCIE,Stunt?,3
RORY,Paris canceled that meet ing.,3
FRANCIE,Something came up.,3
RORY,Then you should have brought it to Paris.,3
FRANCIE,Paris wasn't around. She was off yet again with the mystery man.,3
RORY,Jealous?,3
FRANCIE,Of Paris' lobotomy victim? I think not.,3
RORY,What is wrong with you? So what if Paris has a boyfriend? You don't think that as hard as Paris works in school or on the Franklin or on student council - you don't think that she deserves to have a boyfriend and to enjoy it?,3
FRANCIE,"Hey, no one is denying Gidget a chance to snag Moondoggie for the clambake, but the rest of us have things to accomplish.",3
RORY,You've had one goal since the beginning of the year.,3
FRANCIE,To achieve the perfect liquid line.,3
RORY,To take Paris down.,3
FRANCIE,And to achieve the perfect liquid line.,3
RORY,"I tried to intervene, I tried to smooth the path between both sides, but you know what? That's over.",3
FRANCIE,"Oh, it is?",3
RORY,"Yes, it is. I'm finished being your go-between. You're a jerk, and if you wanna play it this way, then fine. All bets are off. I'm no longer your ally. You wanna play rough   fine. I've read The Art of w*r. I can be just as big a pain in your butt as you are in Paris', capiche?",3
FRANCIE,"You do not wanna be my enemy, Marlo Thomas.",3
RORY,"I think I do, Tina Louise.",3
FRANCIE,Fine.,3
RORY,It is fine.,3
FRANCIE,Can I go now?,3
RORY,The door's right there.,3
FRANCIE,You're gonna be very sorry.,3
RORY,Am I?,3
FRANCIE,Oh yes. . .you are.,3
RORY,,3
RORY,I'm running out of space.,3
LORELAI,How many bouquets you got left?,3
RORY,Three.,3
LORELAI,Can you put them on your dresser?,3
RORY,Dresser's full.,3
LORELAI,Can you squish them in with another bunch?,3
RORY,Already squished.,3
LORELAI,Can you toss them out the window like I did my last five bouquets?,3
RORY,Done.,3
LORELAI,Great.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, so monkey lamp's in the closet, singing rabbi's in a drawer, and all Spice Girl memo rabilia's under your bed. How do I look?",3
RORY,Like a woman who does not own any Spice Girl memorabilia.,3
LORELAI,"You look pretty, too.",3
RORY,Thank you.,3
LORELAI,And I want a play-by-play of the carnival tonight.,3
RORY,I promise.,3
LORELAI,And you can leave out all the  ,3
RORY,"Hand kissing sounds, gladly.",3
LORELAI,"Oop, they're here.",3
RORY,"Hey, if she doesn't like the house   what happens then?",3
LORELAI,I think we have to move. Smile pretty.,3
LORELAI,"Hi Mom, hi Dad, hi Gran. Was your trip good?",3
TRIX,The trip was fine. Hello Rory.,3
RORY,"Hi Gran. Hi Grandma, hi Grandpa.",3
TRIX,"Now that we've exhausted the greetings, kindly move aside. I'd like to see your house.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, come on in.",3
EMILY,If I pass out. . .,3
LORELAI,"I'll yell timber. So, Gran, what do you think? I mean, it's not much. Probably too modest for Korn, but Weezer'd be pretty comfortable.",3
TRIX,Let's go.,3
RORY,Are we moving?,3
LORELAI,I don't know.,3
EMILY,"Lorelai, I swear to God, if you prolong this evening. . .",3
LORELAI,Coming.,3
RORY,Have fun.,3
EMILY,,3
RORY,"Boy, it's pretty out tonight, isn't it?",3
JESS,Sure is.,3
RORY,Like a snow globe.,3
JESS,Mmhmm.,3
RORY,"Sparkly. I mean, I don't think a night comes any prettier than this one. And if you take a really pretty night and add a corndog. . .",3
JESS,I'm not going to that carnival with you.,3
RORY,Why not?,3
JESS,I will be in front of Miss Patty's at nine as promised.,3
RORY,You are stubborn and impossible.,3
JESS,See you at nine.,3
CLARA,Rory!,3
RORY,"Clara, hi!",3
CLARA,I haven't seen you in forever.,3
RORY,Longer than forever.,3
DEAN,She got away from me.,3
JESS,Buy a stronger leash.,3
DEAN,"Hey, uh, did you see they got the crazy psychic from Woodbury again?",3
RORY,You're kidding. I thought she got arrested.,3
DEAN,She's out now and sitting right over there.,3
RORY,I love her. She always tells me I'm gonna be rich and famous.,3
DEAN,She tells everybody that they're gonna be rich and famous.,3
CLARA,Who are you?,3
JESS,No one.,3
CLARA,"Yes, you are.",3
JESS,"No, I'm not.",3
RORY,"That's Jess. Jess, this is Clara.",3
CLARA,Are you guys going to the carnival?,3
RORY,"I'm going, Jess isn't.",3
CLARA,Why not?,3
RORY,He has things to do.,3
CLARA,"Then you can go with me an d Dean, right?",3
RORY,"Oh, well. . .",3
JESS,I'm going.,3
RORY,What?,3
JESS,To the carnival. I'm going to the carnival.,3
CLARA,I thought you had things to do.,3
JESS,"Well, I don't.",3
CLARA,Rory just said you had things to do.,3
JESS,"Hey Tatu, just look at the plane, will ya?",3
CLARA,What?,3
RORY,"Jess, you don't have to go. We can meet later like you said.",3
JESS,"What? No. Come on, how many chances does a guy have to go to a Stars Hollow High winter carnival, right?",3
CLARA,Right.,3
JESS,"Okay, then. Let's go.",3
CLARA,To the carnival!,3
JESS,To the carnival.,3
CLARA,I want a pretzel and a snowcone and a cheese stick. . .,3
DEAN,Pace yourself.,3
CLARA,,3
LORELAI,And this is our dining room.,3
TRIX,Small.,3
LORELAI,Or quaint.,3
TRIX,Touche.,3
RICHARD,"Oh, you're in for a real treat, Trix. This Sookie is one of the best chefs around.",3
LORELAI,"Here's our table, Gran. Why don't you sit here?",3
TRIX,"All right. Well, Lorelai, I must say, on first viewing, this little inn of yours looks quite impressive.",3
LORELAI,Thank you.,3
TRIX,"I mean, it's certainly no arboretum, but it's nice just the same.",3
EMILY,"It was just a suggestion, Mom.",3
TRIX,"Yes, it was. Oh, look, a menu.",3
RICHARD,"Well, that's a nice little touch.",3
LORELAI,"Well, Sookie wanted everything perfect for tonight.",3
MICHELorelai,"Hey, there you are.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, Michel, great. Gran, I'd like you to meet Michel Gerard, our concierge. Michel, this is my grandmother, Lorelai.",3
MICHELorelai,Very pleased to meet you.,3
TRIX,Do you have a pen?,3
MICHELorelai,"Uh, why, of course.",3
TRIX,"Now, please take this to your chef. These are the times I would like each course to appear at this table. I like a brisk pace, twelve minutes per course is best for my digestion. However, please tell your servers that they are not to clear until everyone has finished. Thank you.",3
MICHELorelai,,3
CLARA,Is Jess your real name?,3
JESS,Yes.,3
CLARA,Do you like it?,3
JESS,It's fine.,3
CLARA,Would you rather be named Bill?,3
JESS,No.,3
CLARA,Frank?,3
JESS,No.,3
CLARA,Mike?,3
JESS,No.,3
CLARA,Bob?,3
JESS,No.,3
CLARA,Ed?,3
JESS,Does this belong to you?,3
DEAN,"Clara, you want a snowcone?",3
CLARA,Yes. Will you go get me a s nowcone?,3
JESS,"Absolutely. Go stand in the middle of the street and wait for me, I'll be right back.",3
DEAN,I'll get your snowcone.,3
CLARA,"And one for Rory, too.",3
DEAN,"And one for Rory, too.",3
RORY,Thanks.,3
CLARA,Do you wash your hair?,3
JESS,"Yes, I wash my hair.",3
CLARA,Then why does it stick up like that?,3
JESS,Because.,3
CLARA,It looks crazy.,3
LANE,Rory!,3
RORY,"Hey, how's the fundraiser going? The turnout looks good.",3
LANE,"The turnout's great. Apparently, people are starved for entertainment around here.",3
RORY,"Well, hurrah for bad cable reception.",3
LANE,"So, I'm sorry, but did I just see you with Jess and Dean, or do I need a new prescription?",3
RORY,Your prescription's fine.,3
LANE,So explain.,3
RORY,Tomorrow at Luke's. I need to get back before there's a more exciting ending to the evening.,3
LANE,Forget nothing.,3
RORY,I promise.,3
CLARA,You missed. You missed. You missed.,3
JESS,"Hey, you wanna learn how to fly?",3
RORY,How's everybody doing?,3
CLARA,Jess can't throw.,3
JESS,"I can, too.",3
CLARA,You missed every time.,3
JESS,I can't concentrate with your annoying midget voice yammering on and on. It's like having Stuart Little shoved in my ear.,3
DEAN,Here. They only had cherry.,3
RORY,"Oh, that's all we need.",3
DEAN,"So, you play any of the games yet?",3
CLARA,"Nope, I've been watching him lose. You don't get a bear, but it's still pretty fun.",3
DEAN,"Well, how about I go beat you at ice bowling?",3
CLARA,You can't beat me.,3
DEAN,"Oh, I think I can.",3
CLARA,Let's go!,3
DEAN,We'll be back.,3
RORY,"Okay. So, how much to play?",3
JESS,A dollar.,3
RORY,Okay.,3
JESS,I got it.,3
RORY,"Just for the record, I'm a girl and we are supposed to throw like this.",3
JESS,So you got anything you wanna tell me?,3
RORY,I like your crazy hair.,3
JESS,You weren't just gonna go to the carnival with Dean?,3
RORY,No. Running into them was a total coincidence. I swear.,3
JESS,Okay.,3
RORY,Not even close.,3
JESS,So when did you and Dean get so buddy-buddy again?,3
RORY,We're not so buddy-buddy.,3
JESS,"Last time I checked, you weren't even speaking. Now he's fetching you snowcones?",3
RORY,He was getting one for Clara.,3
JESS,You guys talking?,3
RORY,"No, we're not talking. We talked, once.",3
JESS,You got my interest.,3
RORY,"We ran into each other and he wanted to get coffee, so I did, and we talked.",3
JESS,About?,3
RORY,"Just boring things. Clara's horseback riding, his college application, nothing earth shattering.",3
JESS,Uh huh.,3
RORY,"And he asked if we could be friends, and I said sure.",3
JESS,Friends?,3
RORY,"Jess, he knows we're together, okay? And it's a small town. Dean and I will see it each other, and I just thought it wouldn't hurt to be polite.",3
JESS,So you're just being polite?,3
RORY,"Yes. Dean has never done anything bad to me, and I just, I want to  ",3
JESS,I got it.,3
RORY,You're mad.,3
JESS,"Nope, just figured you could've told me.",3
RORY,I'm sorry.,3
JESS,No biggie. You gonna throw that?,3
RORY,You're really not mad?,3
JESS,"Nope, not mad at all.",3
RORY,And you understand?,3
JESS,I understand.,3
RORY,And you believe me?,3
JESS,Like you're standing with an ax next to a cherry tree.,3
RORY,And you're okay with it?,3
JESS,Will you just throw the ball?,3
RORY,"Oh my God, I did it!",3
JESS,Very impressive.,3
BOY,"Here you go, congratulations.",3
RORY,"Thanks. Hello sad, pathetic bear.",3
JESS,"You know, I could've bought you that thing for a quarter.",3
RORY,"No, it's better that I won it. Maybe Clara would like it.",3
JESS,"Yes, shoved in her mouth.",3
RORY,She's cute.,3
JESS,,3
RICHARD,"And so far, knock wood, things seem to be picking up.",3
TRIX,"Well, it's about time you went into business. Oh, Emily, you should've encouraged him to do this years ago.",3
EMILY,"Yes, I should've.",3
TRIX,"He's a go-getter, your father. Not completely dissimilar to yourself.",3
LORELAI,"Thank you, Gran.",3
SOOKIE,Hello. Just wanted to check and see how your dinner was coming along.,3
LORELAI,"Sookie, it's amazing. Gran, this is our chef, Sookie.",3
TRIX,The food is excellent.,3
SOOKIE,Thank you very much.,3
TRIX,"Young lady, your uniform has a large cut down the middle of your back.",3
SOOKIE,"It does? Oh yeah, I did get myself, huh.",3
EMILY,"Sookie, how on earth did you do that?",3
SOOKIE,"Oh, well, I. . . and the   the chop flew, so I lunged. . .and then the floor slipped. . . and then. . .ooh! You know, and I just. . .did a flip, ya know. I guess you just kind of had to be there.",3
TRIX,"Yes, apparently so.",3
SOOKIE,"Okay, well, nice to meet you. I have to get back. We have quite a tight schedule to follow.",3
TRIX,"Yes, we do.",3
RICHARD,"So, Trix, let's talk about the Hartford house. Do you have a new tenant lined up yet?",3
TRIX,"Yes, I do.",3
RICHARD,Hmm. Who?,3
TRIX,Me.,3
EMILY,What?,3
TRIX,"I wasn't going to bring this up tonight, but since you asked, my health hasn't been too good lately.",3
RICHARD,"What, what's the matter?",3
TRIX,"What the matter is, I'm not twenty. Anyhow, the weather in London is quite damp, and I have a yearning to be a little closer to my immediate family, so now that Korn has moved out of my house, I thought perhaps I would move back in.",3
LORELAI,"Um, when, Gran?",3
TRIX,As soon as I can close up the London house and get my affairs in order.,3
RICHARD,"Well, I think that's a wonderful idea. I'm thrilled. In fact, I'm so thrilled, I'm not going to be angry with you for not telling me you were in ill health.",3
TRIX,"I will be fine, Richard.",3
RICHARD,"You will be fine, because as soon as you're back here, I'm going to send you to the finest doctors.",3
TRIX,Whatever you say.,3
RICHARD,"And Emily and I are going to look after you completely, day and night. You can count on us.",3
TRIX,"I knew I could. Oh, it's time for the next course. Waiter, our next course please.",3
EMILY,I'm not done.,3
TRIX,"What do you mean, you're not done? You had twelve minutes.",3
EMILY,I'm not done.,3
TRIX,"Fine, we will wait.",3
LORELAI,,3
JESS,Need some help with the big words?,3
DEAN,Sure. Why don't you come over here and I'll show you which one's giving me a hard time.,3
JESS,You're getting a little pathetic man.,3
DEAN,Thanks for the heads up.,3
JESS,Let's be friends?,3
DEAN,No thanks.,3
JESS,You don't think I know what you're doing? You don't think it's so pathetically transparent?,3
DEAN,"Get out of here, Jess.",3
JESS,Rory's taking pity on you. That's why the sudden interest in being your friend. You know that?,3
DEAN,Whatever you say.,3
JESS,The saddest part of this whole thing is. . .,3
DEAN,"Man, you like hearing yourself talk.",3
JESS,"You really think that by being her friend, you're gonna get her back.",3
DEAN,I don't know what you're talking about.,3
JESS,"No, huh?",3
DEAN,"Rory and I are just friends, just like you and Rory were just friends. And hey, look how it turned out for you.",3
CLARA,"Okay, I'm ready for popcorn.",3
DEAN,You got it.,3
CLARA,Bye Jess. You think Rory wants some popcorn?,3
DEAN,,3
RORY,This is very impressive.,3
LORELAI,Not as impressive as my mother making four green beans last an hour and a half.,3
RORY,I wish I'd seen that.,3
LORELAI,"When she finally got to the last bean, she cut it in six pieces. I swear, I thought Gran was gonna lunge across the table at her.",3
RORY,The student surpasses the master.,3
LORELAI,I was a little proud. Although I'm bummed I missed the carnival.,3
RORY,There's a snowcone in the freezer for you.,3
LORELAI,How'd it finally end with Cheech and Chong?,3
RORY,"Jess knows I'm friends with Dean, Dean knows I'm dating Jess, and they both seem fine with it. What?",3
LORELAI,"I just like that once in awhile, you still seem like a little kid.",3
RORY,"They do, I swear.",3

LORELAI,Hi.,3
MAID,Good evening. May I take your coats?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, sure, thanks.",3
EMILY,That's the most absurd thing I've ever heard.,3
MAID,Your mother's in the living room.,3
LORELAI,"So last chance to run, huh?",3
MAID,Excuse me?,3
RORY,Just ignore her.,3
EMILY,"Of course I said it. Well, I can't imagine who would take jackbooted as a compliment. I will not apologize. Every time she went to the pantry, I thought she was marching on Poland. Oh, I see, because I want things a certain way, I'm unreasonable?",3
RORY,Shh!,3
EMILY,"Why, that is the most absurd. . .I want to see this document. Fax it to me immediately.",3
LORELAI,Fax it to me immed iately?,3
RORY,She's part of the electronic age.,3
EMILY,"Tomorrow morning is completely unacceptable. It's unacceptable because I'm paying you three hundred dollars an hour. So turn that little near-luxury car around, go back to your office,",3
Posted,02/02/03 09:14and fax me that libelous scrap of paper.,3
LORELAI,"Ask him if he can pick up some ice cream, too.",3
EMILY,"Well, tell your wife to tape your daughter's recital. Unbelievable.",3
LORELAI,Hi Mom.,3
RORY,Hi Grandma.,3
EMILY,When did you two get here?,3
LORELAI,Sometime between the second absurd and the third unbelievable.,3
EMILY,I apologize. That call caught me off guard.,3
RORY,"Is everything all right, Grandma?",3
EMILY,Everything's fine.,3
LORELAI,Are you sure?,3
EMILY,I'm sure.,3
LORELAI,You look peeved.,3
EMILY,I'm not peeved.,3
LORELAI,"Well, you look peeved.",3
EMILY,Kindly stop making me say the word peeved.,3
LORELAI,"Mom, spill it. What's wrong?",3
EMILY,That was our lawyer calling to inform me that one of our former maids is suing for wrongful termination.,3
LORELAI,Hm.,3
EMILY,You might at least act surprised.,3
LORELAI,"It's not the first time, is it?",3
EMILY,It most certainly is.,3
LORELAI,Really?,3
EMILY,"Yes, Lorelai, really.",3
LORELAI,"Well, then, I'm surprised.",3
EMILY,"It's beyond surprising, it's outrageous.",3
RORY,What did Grandpa say?,3
EMILY,Your Grandfather's still in London helping his mother close down her house. Of course he'd be gone when this happens.,3
LORELAI,I think he planned it that way.,3
RORY,Which maid was it?,3
EMILY,"Gerta, the one from Hamburg, Germany.",3
LORELAI,Which one was she?,3
RORY,You rememb er   she was the one you made all those Hamburg/hamburger jokes to.,3
LORELAI,"God, I beat that dead horse.",3
RORY,With glee.,3
EMILY,She was the clomper.,3
LORELAI,The clomper?,3
EMILY,She'd be upstairs making the beds and it'd sound like a Munich beer hall rally.,3
LORELAI,That's why you fired her?,3
EMILY,Yes.,3
LORELAI,Because she made noise when she walked?,3
EMILY,Yes.,3
LORELAI,Was she a good maid otherwise?,3
EMILY,What?,3
LORELAI,"Besides the clomping, was she polite, on time, made sure the little fork went on the outside?",3
EMILY,Have you been listening to me? She was not performing her duties as I wished them to be performed. Everything else is beside the point.,3
LORELAI,"Well, I guess it's always something, isn't it?",3
EMILY,What's that supposed to mean?,3
LORELAI,"It means you always seem to find the one thing about a maid that negates all of her good qualities. I mean, at a certain point, isn't it just easier to let a couple things slide?",3
EMILY,I see. So it's my fault?,3
LORELAI,I didn't say that.,3
EMILY,"No, Lorelai, you did. For years, I've been listening to you and your father and everyone else go on and on about how demanding I am, how I have to have things a certain way. Well, guess what? I pay to have them that way. I pay more than anyone else pays their maids, and when thingsare not the way I want, that means I'm not getting what I paid for. Why is that so hard to understand?",3
LORELAI,"It isn't hard to understand, it's just  ",3
EMILY,"If you pay for first class and the airline sticks you in coach, people expect you to be upset. No one calls you demanding or unreasonable. And yet here is this woman whom I pay more than she can get anywhere else in Hartford, whose severance package could finance a summer cruise down the Rhine, dragging me in to court saying that I was unfair. Why? Because having paid for one thing, I'm not content with something else? That makes me unfair? Well, then, so be it. Let someone else pay first class and ride in steerage, not me.",3
MAID,"Excuse me, Mrs. Gilmore, dinner's ready",3
EMILY,"Thank you, Brooke, we'll be right there.",3
EMILY,"Wait, wait, wait. Do you hear that?",3
LORELAI,Hear what?,3
EMILY,,3
SOOKIE,"You know, next time I want some grapefruit, I'm just gonna ask for a kazoo because you can only seem to get me the most bizarre opposite.",3
JACKSON,What is your problem?,3
MICHELorelai,I need you to  ,3
LORELAI,Shh!,3
MICHELorelai,"What? Oh, it started. You were supposed to call me.",3
LORELAI,Stop talking.,3
JACKSON,I understand perfectly. You wanna be a dictator.,3
SOOKIE,"Oh, come off it.",3
JACKSON,"Comman dant St. James says, ""Brussels sprouts! You will bring me the Brussels sprouts.""",3
SOOKIE,"I'm trying to plan a menu here, Jackson!",3
MICHELorelai,"Fill me in , please.",3
LORELAI,Jackson brought pea tendrils instead of Brussels sprouts.,3
MICHELorelai,"Well, aren't we Evil Knievel?",3
LORELAI,Coffee?,3
MICHELorelai,"Oh, please.",3
SOOKIE,Pea tendrils are too delicate to serve with the lamb shank!,3
JACKSON,I don't think that they are.,3
SOOKIE,Where are the Brussels sprouts?,3
JACKSON,"I looked at the st*lks, they weren't good enough.",3
SOOKIE,You always do this to me.,3
JACKSON,Doesn't it matter that I care so much about the quality of the produce that I sell you that I'd be willing to risk an enormous argument just to save your dinner.,3
SOOKIE,What?,3
LORELAI,"Oops, that was dumb.",3
SOOKIE,Save my dinner?,3
JACKSON,You know what I meant.,3
SOOKIE,"Yes, my dinner is out standing on a ledge. Oh no! What's gonna happen?",3
JACKSON,Sookie.,3
SOOKIE,"Oh wait! What's that? It's a bird, it's a plane, it's Super Jackson and his atomic pea tendrils!",3
JACKSON,You wanna get another produce guy?,3
SOOKIE,Maybe I should!,3
JACKSON,"Well, go ahead!",3
SOOKIE,Don't tempt me!,3
JACKSON,"That's it, I am leaving.",3
SOOKIE,Go! And take the tendrils with you!,3
JACKSON,Fine! See you tonight?,3
SOOKIE,I love you.,3
LORELAI,And it always ends with a hug.,3
MICHELorelai,Hm.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, what do you need?",3
MICHELorelai,The new insurance policies you ordered.,3
LORELAI,"Good. Now the inspector's supposed to be coming by to check the place out tomorrow, so you're gonna have to show him around.",3
MICHELorelai,What?,3
LORELAI,"You're covering for me, remembe r?",3
MICHELorelai,"Oh, yes, that's right. Tomorrow the two of you go back to school.",3
LORELAI,"It's not school, it's a one-day course at the learning center.",3
SOOKIE,How to run an inn.,3
MICHELorelai,"Yes, amazing you've been able to fake it so long.",3
LORELAI,"This is specific to opening small inns, bed and breakfasts.",3
MICHELorelai,I see. Order half of everything. There   you owe me seventy-five dollars.,3
LORELAI,Why are you being such a snob about this? You went to hotel school.,3
MICHELorelai,I attended the Ecole Hôtelière de Genève.,3
LORELAI,"Wow, that's gotta make one hell of a sweatshirt.",3
MICHELorelai,"It was one of the premiere hotel schools in the world. You two, on the other hand, are going to take a two-hour course at the Radisson.",3
SOOKIE,Jackson's taken a lot of courses through The Learning Center and he loves it. He took beekeeping  ,3
LORELAI,Jackson keeps bees?,3
SOOKIE,"No, it turned out he was allergic. One stung his lip and his whole head blew up to three times his normal size.",3
MICHELorelai,Please tell me you have pictures.,3
SOOKIE,"He also took a course in how to buy foreclosed real estate, and how to write a diary.",3
LORELAI,How do you not know how to write a diary?,3
SOOKIE,He's a searcher.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, he is.",3
SOOKIE,"Plus, I think he was really lonely before we got together and he didn't live near a good bar.",3
MICHELorelai,"Yes, well, I predict that tomorrow will be a complete waste of time and money, and I will be here to laugh at you when you return.",3
LORELAI,"Thanks for your support. Forget him. Opening our own is a huge step, and anything that might help is worth trying.",3
SOOKIE,Exactly partner.,3
LORELAI,Now tell me you got pictures of Jackson and his giant head.,3
SOOKIE,,3
RORY,Hey Paris.,3
PARIS,Have you looked over the votes for commencement speaker?,3
RORY,Yeah.,3
PARIS,Are the ones for Princess Diana's butler jokes or real?,3
RORY,I'd say jokes.,3
PARIS,What about the ones for Dr. Phil?,3
RORY,I think real.,3
PARIS,"I knew that suggestion box was a bad idea. Watch Choate get Joan Didion while we're being read ""Eloise at the Plaza.""",3
RORY,"Listen, before the others get here, we should probably decide what we're going to do.",3
PARIS,About what?,3
RORY,About the prom coup Francie staged last week.,3
PARIS,You mean booking Wadsworth Mansion?,3
RORY,Using all of the money reserved for the telescope that we wanted to buy for the senior gift.,3
PARIS,Why does one pinhead always have to vote for Jerry Garcia?,3
RORY,"I'm not sure if the deposit check has been sent yet, but -",3
PARIS,I already took care of that.,3
RORY,What?,3
PARIS,Wadsworth Mansion is owned by the Connecticut Daughters of the Mayflower. Most of those biddies couldn't negotiate an icy sidewalk much less a contract. Took me about five minutes on the phone to get them down to half their asking price.,3
RORY,You're kidding.,3
PARIS,"Well, there was no way I was letting the class gift be a stupid tree just so Ginger Spice can have her Barbie dream prom.",3
RORY,She's a sneak.,3
PARIS,She's not smart enough to be a sneak. Anyone can call a meeting. It's that loser Mr. Hunter that let her get away with it.,3
RORY,"Well, she kind of forced him into it.",3
PARIS,"You can't force a teacher into something, Rory. No, it was Hunter. He's been jealous of me since I got into office. Whenever I announce I have a new motion to introduce, he flinches. Actually, physically tightens up for a moment. It's creepy.",3
RORY,"Yeah, but  ",3
FRANCIE,"Well, out fearless leaders at work already. I feel so safe.",3
RORY,That girl bugs me.,3
PARIS,"Relax, she's harmless. MR.",3
HUNTERory,"Paris, Rory.",3
PARIS,"Paris, Rory. Bed wetter. Shall we sit?",3
RORY,"Fine, let's sit.",3
PARIS,I call this meet ing of the student council to order. Is the secretary ready?,3
MADELINE,I am.,3
PARIS,"Then let's proceed. First of all, I'd like to apologize for missing last week's somewhat impromptu meet ing. As most of you know, its scheduling was somewhat unorthodox since the meet ing was a supplementary meet ing, which was a concept invented by me. So the fact that anyone would hold a meet ing invented by a certain person without that certain person seems, well. . .let's see, what's the word? Mutinous, insulting, underhanded, and in the end, fruitless, since I managed to re-negotiate the rental fee for the Wadsworth Mansion so that we'll be able to have the prom and give the school a respectable senior gift in the form of a telescope. Any questions, Mr. Christian? I mean, Mr. Hunter. MR.",3
HUNTERory,"Uh, no.",3
PARIS,"Good. So, now that that's out of the way, let's move onto other business. Francie?",3
FRANCIE,"As you know, Health Week is coming up. We have speakers lined up to discuss everything from heart disease and exercise to the dangers of sun damage and fried food. Everyone's booked and ready to go. The only thing left to figure out is where to set up the sign-up table for the annual blood drive.",3
FRANCIE,Geez!,3
RORY,What's the matter?,3
LOUISE,She hates the word blood.,3
FRANCIE,Give me a h eart attack.,3
LOUISE,Just keep your hands on your ears.,3
MADELINE,Tell me w hen it's over.,3
FRANCIE,"As I was saying before the freak-out, we need to figure out where to place the sign up table for the blood drive.",3
MADELINE,I can still here her.,3
LOUISE,Hum to yourself.,3
PARIS,"Continue, please.",3
FRANCIE,"I am proposing putting it in the cafeteria. It's got easy access, maximum exposure, and almost ninety percent of the student body visits the cafeteria every day. It's the perfect location.",3
PARIS,Well?,3
RORY,No.,3
FRANCIE,Excuse me?,3
RORY,You can't set up in the cafeteria. It's a fire hazard.,3
PARIS,It is?,3
RORY,"Yes, it's a fire hazard. You'll have to find another place.",3
FRANCIE,You're kidding.,3
RORY,I never kid about fire safety.,3
FRANCIE,"Well, Rory, I actually know the fire codes for the cafeteria, and as long as we don't cram more than three hundred people in there, we can start an opium den and the fire department wouldn't care.",3
RORY,"A, Francie, I think they would care, and B, I'm not talking about numbers. You set up that table, get people thinking about blood, someone smells smoke, and the next thing you know, fifty stampeding teenagers are using your body to lever open a door. I won't allow that.",3
FRANCIE,This is Xanadu-level of insane.,3
PARIS,You do realize you're opposing the blood drive?,3
RORY,"No, I'm opposing the blood drive in the cafeteria.",3
PARIS,Is it really that big a deal?,3
RORY,"It's the rules, Paris, the rules of common decency, and I'll be damned if I let Francie ignore those rules.",3
PARIS,,3
LORELAI,Dinner!,3
RORY,Over here.,3
LORELAI,We are so in luck. It was international grab bag night at Al's.,3
RORY,Cool. Did you peek?,3
LORELAI,And ruin the whole point of the mystery dinner? I think not. Pick.,3
RORY,That one.,3
LORELAI,Okay. I love this. It's food and a game all in one. Now we open them at the same time.,3
RORY,I know the rules.,3
LORELAI,And do not jump the g*n.,3
RORY,There's a lot of pressure associated with international grab bag night.,3
LORELAI,"Well, I am your mother, it is my responsibility to give you structure. Now, on three   one, two, three.",3
RORY,"Hm, Moroccan.",3
LORELAI,You always say Moroccan.,3
RORY,"And sooner or later, I will be right. What's yours?",3

RORY,Way to hedge your bet. Kitchen?,3
LORELAI,Just let me check the machine.,3
RORY,Okay. ANSWERING,3
MACHINE,"Ms. Gilmore, it's Bob Merrimam, your mother's lawyer. I'm calling about the little matter of this lawsuit she's involved in. We'd like it if you could give a deposition. . .",3
LORELAI,Uh. ANSWERING,3
MACHINE,". . on her behalf. It shouldn't be a big deal. If you could just call me tomorrow with some times that would be convenient for you, I can set something up. . .",3
LORELAI,"Oh, no! ANSWERING",3
MACHINE,". . .Thanks, bye.",3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,"No, no, no, no, no.",3
EMILY,Hello?,3
LORELAI,No.,3
EMILY,Who is this?,3
LORELAI,I am not giving a deposition.,3
EMILY,"Of course you are, don't be ridiculous.",3
LORELAI,Please leave me out of this.,3
EMILY,"I see. So you're just going to let this lead-footed teutonic chambermaid drag your mother into a public forum and humiliate her, is that it? Is that what I'm hearing?",3
LORELAI,Mom.,3
EMILY,Her lawyer knows we asked for this deposition. How do you think it's going to look when you refuse to testify for your own mother?,3
LORELAI,Like it's none of my business.,3
EMILY,"Oh, and I'm sure the twelve rocket scientists they assemble as a jury of my peers will see it that way.",3
LORELAI,"Honestly, Mom, I doubt they'll be able to find twelve people in the state of Connecticut who haven't been fired by you.",3
EMILY,I can't believe my own daughter won't come to my defense.,3
LORELAI,I'm not gonna lie for you.,3
EMILY,I just want you to tell them how I treat my maids.,3
LORELAI,I'm not gonna lie for you.,3
EMILY,All you have to do is tell them I treat the help fairly.,3
LORELAI,I'm not gonna lie for you.,3
EMILY,"Lorelai, there is something called family loyalty. It means when someone is in trouble, you help them, as I have helped you several times over the years. The very least you could do in return is spend half an hour saying something kind about your mother.",3
LORELAI,Fine.,3
EMILY,Thank you. Your devotion is touching.,3
LORELAI,I have to give a deposition.,3
RORY,I don't think this is Moroccan   or at least not recently.,3
LORELAI,Want some of mine?,3
RORY,Nope.,3
LORELAI,Yikes. Luke's?,3
RORY,,3
LECTURERory,"I can't stress enough the value of a good paint job. One of the first decisions you'll have to make when you open your inn is whether to employ your housekeepers individually or contract out to a housekeeping service. If you use a service, you will be assured of having a replacement housekeeper if one should call in sick or quit suddenly.",3
SOOKIE,"But you'll pay two dollars more an hour and they'll be loyal to the service, not to you.",3
LECTURERory,"However, you'll probably end up paying a bit more than if you hired them individually.",3
SOOKIE,"I can't believe you're taking notes. He has said nothing in the last two hours that we didn't already know, and he's saying it really condescendingly. So in addition to being bored, I'm getting hostile, and a little insecure  cause you're studying and I'm not.",3
LORELAI,Pick a color.,3
SOOKIE,Pink!,3
LORELAI, Cause you're a girl.,3
SOOKIE,Exactly.,3

LECTURERory,Some of us are here to learn.,3
LORELAI,Sorry.,3
SOOKIE,"Yeah, sorry.",3
LORELAI,We had a cootie catcher. . .,3
SOOKIE,We're sorry.,3
LORELAI,Sorry.,3
LECTURERory,"As I was saying, the points we've covered should get you started, but remember, it's a long process, so don't get discouraged. I'm sure one day I'll be staying in each and every one of you inns.",3
LORELAI,He's not staying in our inn.,3
LECTURERory,Now don't run off just yet. We've got one final treat. I'd like to introduce you all to John Mattern.,3
JOHN,Hello everyone. I'm very pleased to be here addressing you today. I asked Brian if I could just have a few minutes at the end of today to show you all some opportunities that I think you're going to find really exciting. I know that I do. If we could. Now this is a lovely property that has just become av ailable right outside of Litchfield.,3
SOOKIE,It's a sales pitch?,3
LORELAI,"They spend two hours telling us nothing, then try to sell us lame property?",3
SOOKIE,We already know the place we're buying.,3
LORELAI,I know.,3
SOOKIE,So what do we do?,3
LORELAI,"I'm crushing your head, I'm crushing your head. Let's go.",3
JOHN,,3
SOOKIE,Unbelievably shocking.,3
LORELAI,That we could work at an inn for so long and learn so little.,3
SOOKIE,We must be some kind of dumb.,3
LORELAI,Who would ever have thought that all inns need doors?,3
SOOKIE,Not me.,3
LORELAI,And floors.,3
SOOKIE,"Doors and floors, we can't afford that.",3
LORELAI,"Well, we better, otherwise our guests will fall right through to China.",3
SOOKIE,I can just imagine the phone calls.,3
LORELAI,What was Jackson thinking saying these courses were good?,3
SOOKIE,"Please, you're asking me? The man took a course in diary writing.",3
LORELAI,Thank God   food.,3
SOOKIE,"So, is it worth it if we can make up our seventy-five dollar admission fee in cookies?",3
LORELAI,"Well, considering that in the past hour, I uttered the phrase, ""My God, I should've listened to Michel,"" these better be the best damn cookies in the world.",3
SOOKIE,And they taste like feet.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, well, even their cookies suck. Stand by, I'm going in for coffee.",3
JOE,Sookie? Sookie St. James?,3
SOOKIE,Uh huh.,3
JOE,It's Joe. . . Joe Mastoni from the Deerhill Lodge.,3
SOOKIE,"Oh my God, Joe! Joe! Joe from the Deerhill Lodge! It's Joe from the Deerhill Lodge! How are you? Sorry. Well, come here. Oh! Lorelai, this is Joe. Joe, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,Hi.,3
JOE,"Nice to meet you. This is Alex, my partner.",3
ALEX,Business partner.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, clarification duly noted. Nice to meet you.",3
SOOKIE,Joe and I worked together one summer up in the Berkshires.,3
JOE,"Oh, God, we had a wild time that summer, didn't we?",3
LORELAI,"You had a wild time, huh? Do tell.",3
SOOKIE,"We'd all work fourteen hours straight, party  til dawn, then pile in Joe's van and wake up in New Hampshire or Maine with just enough time to get back for the next shift.",3
JOE,"We had a real interesting crew. Sookie, me, Feldman, Mellon, Bung  ",3
LORELAI,Bung?,3
SOOKIE,"He was the grill man. He had been up there for a couple years already, but Joe and I were both in prep.",3
LORELAI,And I repeat - Bung?,3
ALEX,Don't look at me. I'm still wondering if Mellon's a man or a woman.,3
JOE,"You know, I promised myself after that summer, I would never chop small green things en masse ever again.",3
SOOKIE,Or drink all the leftover wine on an empty stomach.,3
JOE,"Let me see your hands. Hey, nice blisters.",3
SOOKIE,"Let me see yours. Ooh, not bad, not bad.",3
JOE,I'm mo re careful about using the towels with the hot stuff these days.,3
SOOKIE,Sissy.,3
JOE,"Yeah, yeah. So what are you doing here?",3
SOOKIE,"Lorelai and I are opening an inn together, so we came for a class.",3
JOE,Really? Alex and I are here for a class about opening your own coffee place.,3
ALEX,"Chain of coffee places, actually.",3
SOOKIE,That's great.,3
JOE,We'll see. It's pretty new territory for us.,3
ALEX,"Joe at least knows the food industry. I'm coming from ironworks, so I basically know what the security gate you pull down at the end of the night should be made of.",3
JOE,Don't listen to him. Alex is an incredible businessman.,3
LORELAI,Ah.,3
ALEX,That's true.,3
JOE,"So far, we've got the business model planned out, there's a couple of prime locations we're interested in. The only thing left to do besides build the place is pick a name.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, little tip, don't choose anything cute.",3
SOOKIE,Like Jitters.,3
LORELAI,Or Spill the Beans.,3
SOOKIE,Or Higher Ground.,3
LORELAI,Or The Mudhouse.,3
ALEX,"Actually, I kinda like that.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, me too. We call dibs.",3
ALEX,I thought you were opening an inn.,3
LORELAI,"Well, we wanna keep our options open.",3
JOE,"Hey, did you hear about Feldman's restaurant?",3
SOOKIE,The Feldster opened a restaurant?,3
LORELAI,"Okay, I know I'm repeating myself, but the Feldster?",3
SOOKIE,I can't believe he opened his own place. He spent the whole summer getting stoned in the walk-in.,3
JOE,He was our baker.,3
LORELAI,"Right, that figures.",3
SOOKIE,Huh?,3
ALEX,"Baker, getting baked, I'm there.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, congratulations. You still can't have The Mudhouse.",3
JOE,"Hey, you rememb er the last reception we catered? The parakeets, everyone dressed as knights and ladies.",3
SOOKIE,Oh God!,3
ALEX,"Old friends, huh?",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, there's nothing like them.",3
SOOKIE,I never did figure out how Bung got into a fight with the bride.,3
JOE,"One minute everything was fine, the next he's beaning her with the ice sculpture.",3
LORELAI,"Hey, rememb er the time you and Fat Sal got locked in the freezer overnight?",3
ALEX,Fat Sal?,3
LORELAI,Work with me here.,3
ALEX,"Oh, Fat Sal, yes, right.",3
SOOKIE,Then Feldman got into a fight with the bride's mother.,3
JOE,That's right! He went after the whole bridal party.,3
LORELAI,And you rememb er how me an d the Bruiser  ,3
ALEX,Never liked that guy.,3
LORELAI,We found you and Fat Sal in the morning and you were frozen together like bacon.,3
ALEX,"Yeah. You know, I still can't eat bacon.",3
LORELAI,Well. . .,3
JOE,And you rememb er what Feldman told the cops?,3
SOOKIE,"Oh, yeah!",3
LORELAI,"And then before Bruiser and I would let you out, we made you and Fat Sal kiss.",3
ALEX,I'm not sure I rememb er that.,3
SOOKIE,"You know, I actually don't remembe r what Feldman told the cops.",3
JOE,"He tried to pretend he didn't speak English, remember?",3
SOOKIE,"That's right, oh my God! The flooginshorts!",3
JOE,"Yes, the flooginshorts!",3
LORELAI,"Oh, great. Now we have to make up our own language?",3
ALEX,This is getting exhausting.,3
JOE,"You know, Feldman's restaurant's right here in Hartford.",3
SOOKIE,"No, really?",3
JOE,Yeah. We should swing by one night and bust his chops.,3
SOOKIE,"Hey, yeah, we could keep sending back plate after plate until he gets so angry he comes out.",3
JOE,Let's make a plan.,3
SOOKIE,"Sure. Call me at the Independence Inn, that's where we work.",3
LORELAI,For now.,3
JOE,Sounds great. I'm so glad we ran into each other.,3
SOOKIE,Me too.,3
JOE,"And it was nice meet ing you, Lorelai. Good luck with everything.",3
LORELAI,"Thanks, you too.",3
ALEX,I'm really glad we got a chance to catch up.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah. Hey, if you see Fat Sal, give him a kiss for me.",3
ALEX,I'll do that.,3
LORELAI,Okay.,3
SOOKIE,Bye.,3
SOOKIE,"Wait, so you and that guy knew each other, too? What a coincidence!",3

PARIS,"How many times do I have to tell them? You can't put a two-inch ladle of gravy into a one- inch potato crater. You either need a smaller ladle or a bigger crater   otherwise, you get this.",3
RORY,Gravy on your asparagus.,3
PARIS,Yes.,3
RORY,"Paris, the cafeteria workers serve hundreds of students a day. A little gravy spillage is natural.",3
PARIS,I see. So I should just sit quietly and shovel in whatever slop they throw my way like some inmate in the chow line at Leavenworth doing twenty to life? I don't think so.,3
RORY,I'll save your seat.,3
PARIS,,3
FRANCIE,"Good, you're here. We need to talk.",3
RORY,"We have three classes together, we couldn't talk then?",3
FRANCIE,"I thought alone would be better. Besides, you picked the place.",3
RORY,What do you want?,3
FRANCIE,I want a truce.,3
RORY,Excuse me?,3
FRANCIE,"A truce, you know, no more fighty fighty.",3
RORY,I don't believe you.,3
FRANCIE,"Look, this is not the way I wanted things to work out, honestly. Yes, the hemline thing bugged me, and yes, Paris is not my idea of a secret sister, but I never intended for things to go so far.",3
RORY,No?,3
FRANCIE,"No. I mean, it's my senior year, too. Why would I want to spend the whole time scheming and fighting? It's too exhausting. I wanna stop this w*r, this vendetta, this Sicilian thing. It mustend.",3
RORY,This seems awful sudden.,3
FRANCIE,"Yes, well, my time is precious, so if I'm not gonna truly commit to a grudge, I'd like to move on and put that energy somewhere else. Come on, what do you say? Friends, sort of?",3
RORY,Friends. . .sort of.,3
FRANCIE,Shake.,3
RORY,,3
LORELAI,"Okay, so you'll come in early and set up the conference room for the group from Michigan.",3
MICHELorelai,"Yes, I will.",3
LORELAI,"Okay. Now, Sookie's on top of the menu. Let's make sure the, uh, dining room's open for a late lunch, and we need to confirm the number of rooms they'll need.",3
MICHELorelai,"Yes, I have all of this written down on a notepad right next to my self-help book, ""Why Don't People Think You Know What The Hell You're Doing?""",3
LORELAI,Sorry. I'm just a little stressed at this whole stupid deposition thing.,3
MICHELorelai,"Relax, it's very easy.",3
LORELAI,It is? You've done it?,3
MICHELorelai,"Once, it was nothing.",3
LORELAI,Why were you deposed?,3
MICHELorelai,"My neighbor had this dog, a frisky little scamp that used to love to yap to his friends all night long. It was so cute. Then one day he disappeared. I told the police what I knew, but sadly the adorable little chatterbox was never found. It was tragic.",3
LORELAI,You got rid of a dog?,3
MICHELorelai,No.,3
LORELAI,How could you get rid of a dog?,3
MICHELorelai,I will gladly show you the transcript from the lawyer and the results of the lie detector test.,3
LORELAI,You're heinous.,3
MICHELorelai,And very well rested.,3
JOE,"Lorelai, hi. Rememb er me?",3
LORELAI,"Of course I do. Nice to see you again, Joe.",3
JOE,This is a beautiful place you have here.,3
LORELAI,"Ah, well, you know. . . keeps the rain off.",3
JOE,"Right. So, is Sookie around?",3
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, uh, she is. Uh, right through there in the kitchen.",3
JOE,Thank you.,3
MICHELorelai,"Here, give me those. I'll file them with the rest.",3
MICHELorelai,,3
SOOKIE,"Hey, I'll just be a minute.",3
JOE,"Oh no, don't rush.",3
SOOKIE,"I was almost finished with the dinner prep, and then I changed my mind about two of the appetizers.",3
JOE,"Sounds like old times. Though, I gotta say, this place is a long way from the sweatbox at the Deerhill.",3
SOOKIE,"Yeah, we've upgraded a lot in the past few years. We just got a refrigerated prep table and we replaced the two vertical mixers.",3
JOE,But you still got the old fifty-two inch Viking.,3
SOOKIE,I know. I just like how big it is. I blew it up once.,3
JOE,Wow.,3
SOOKIE,But I had them rebuild it. I refuse to cook on anything else.,3
JOE,Stick with what you know.,3
SOOKIE,Exactly. Taste this.,3
JOE,Maybe a bit more brandy.,3
SOOKIE,I knew you'd say that.,3
JOE,"Well, people like brandy.",3
SOOKIE,You mean you like brandy.,3
JOE,"And I'm people. We always had a good time together, didn't we?",3
SOOKIE,"Yeah, it was a good group.",3
JOE,You always made it better.,3
SOOKIE, Cause I kept you fools from driving off the side of a mountain.,3
JOE,"Very true. You know, I'm really glad we ran into each other. It's not often you get a second chance.",3
SOOKIE,What do you mean?,3
JOE,"I can't tell you how many times I kicked myself for not asking you out that summer. It just seemed like every time I got close, we'd end up talking about the best way to make calves liver or something.",3
SOOKIE,Sautéed with caramelized onions.,3
JOE,"Exactly. Then when I saw you at the Learning Center, it was like fate was saying, ""Here you go, man. Try not to screw it up again."" I guess things just had to happen in their own time.",3
SOOKIE,,3
LORELAI,"Oh, no, sir, I'm afraid we don't offer a complimentary breakfast.",3
SOOKIE,He thinks it's a date.,3
LORELAI,"Uh, yes, sir, I realize the Ramada does.",3
SOOKIE,Lorelai!,3
LORELAI,"Uh, well, if you like, I could recommend a few places in town. Uh, okay, uh huh, sure. Why don't you talk to your wife and call me back. Okay, bye. Hey, Shields and Yarnell, what's going on?",3
SOOKIE,He thinks it's a date.,3
LORELAI,What?,3
SOOKIE,"Joe, he thinks this is a date.",3
LORELAI,Is he crazy?,3
SOOKIE,"Exactly. You were there   it's not a date, is it?",3
LORELAI,No. The two of you were gonna go bust Feldster's chops. Busting chops is not a date.,3
SOOKIE,"That's what I thought, but he keeps saying how he liked me back then and how this is his second chance.",3
LORELAI,He's liked you for ten years?,3
SOOKIE,Yes.,3
LORELAI,Wow. That is some serious Great Gatsby pining.,3
SOOKIE,I know.,3
LORELAI,You're his Daisy.,3
SOOKIE,I am? I'm his Daisy. I'm someone's Daisy.,3
LORELAI,It's very flattering.,3
SOOKIE,"It is very flattering. But I didn't bring it on, did I? I mean, did I flirt?",3
LORELAI,"No, you did not flirt. You were talking about Bung.",3
SOOKIE,"Right. And you can't flirt when talking about Bung, it's impossible.",3
LORELAI,He read something into it because he wanted to.,3
SOOKIE,"Oh my God, what's Jackson's gonna say?",3
LORELAI,"Sookie, it's a misunderstanding. Jackson will be fine. Just go in there and explain it to Joe.",3
SOOKIE,But what do I tell him? He's waited ten years for this. How do you hand out that kind of rejection? I could tell him I've become a lesbian!,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, or ""I'm mar ried"" might work.",3
SOOKIE,"Right, I'm mar ried, good, that's very good.",3
LORELAI,It's gonna be fine. Joe's a nice guy with good taste.,3
SOOKIE,I'm his Daisy.,3
LORELAI,Be happy later.,3
SOOKIE,Right. I'm going in.,3
LORELAI,"Independence Inn, Lorelai speaking.",3
JOE,"So, at the risk of seeming like Joe the drunken chef, I added some more Port to the Cumberland sauce. Now, just promise to try it.",3
SOOKIE,"Joe, we need to talk.",3
JOE,"Wow, you've mellowed. In the old days, you would've just called me an idiot and just dumpedit in the trash.",3
SOOKIE,"It's not that, it's. . .you put in more Port? This is a pheasant sauce, not the punch bowl at a frat party.",3
JOE,Just try it.,3
SOOKIE,"No, no, no, no, no, that's not what I meant to say. It's just. . .there's been a misunderstanding. I thought this thing tonight was just a friends thing, you know, not like a date thing.",3
JOE,Oh.,3
SOOKIE,"Not that going out with you would be bad. Except it would be. . . very, very bad.",3
JOE,Wow.,3
SOOKIE,"But only because I'm mar ried! I meant to say that first. See? Last May, I just. . . Where's my. . .oh, hang on. See, this was supposed to be. . .when I hold my hand up,  cause otherwise, ""Whatcha doin'?"", right? Okay, here. I take it off when I'm cooking, but, look, there it is, right where it should be, on my finger.",3
JOE,You're married.,3
SOOKIE,"Yes, I am. I hope that's okay.",3
JOE,"Hey, if your husband's good with it, who am I to complain?",3
SOOKIE,You're not mad?,3
JOE,Why would I be mad?,3
SOOKIE,Because you thought this was a date.,3
JOE,"I'm not mad. Feeling a little stupid, but not mad.",3
SOOKIE,"Here, let me give you some mo ney.",3
JOE,I didn't spend any money.,3
SOOKIE,"Well, let me give you some mon ey anyway.",3
JOE,"Look, the only way I'll be mad is if you throw that sauce out before you try it, okay?",3
SOOKIE,Okay.,3
JOE,"Tell you what, why don't we make a plan to harass Feldman some other time? You can bring your husband and I'll see if I can get a real date.",3
SOOKIE,"That'd be fun. Come on, I'll walk you out.",3
JOE,"You know, we could even get some of the old g*ng together.",3
SOOKIE,I'll drive.,3
JOE,"I guess this'll teach me not to wait ten years next time. Anyway, I'll give you a call.",3
SOOKIE,Bye Joe.,3
LORELAI,"See, he's smiling. I knew it was nothing to get worked up over. You obviously let him down very well, and now maybe you guys can be friends.",3
SOOKIE,,3
LORELAI,This is silly. I know how to answer a question.,3
RORY,This is your first deposition. Grandma's lawyers just want you to be prepared.,3
LORELAI,"Sample questions, great. It's bad enough I have to give a deposition, now I have to study for it?",3
RORY,Shall we begin?,3
LORELAI,Go ahead.,3
RORY,Please describe how your mother runs her household.,3
LORELAI,"Okay. Well, do you rememb er the rowing scene in Ben Hur?",3
RORY,Mom.,3
LORELAI,"I'm sorry, did that reference date me? Should I have gone with the ""Express Yourself"" video?",3
RORY,Shall we stop?,3
LORELAI,"Sorry, ask me an other.",3
RORY,Would you say your mother is an easy woman to get along with?,3
LORELAI,No. Next.,3
RORY,You're not taking this seriously.,3
LORELAI,I am taking this seriously.,3
RORY,"Well, you can't say that.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, wow, so you want me to lie.",3
RORY,"No, you don't have to lie. It's all about how you present the truth. For example, you could have said, ""My mother is a perfectionist.""",3
LORELAI,Uh huh. And do you promise to visit Mommy in jail?,3
RORY,"Yes, I do.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, then. My mother is a perfectionist.",3
RORY,Very good.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, hey. Where you going?",3
LUKE,"Oh, well, I'm going to Doose's because we are out of food.",3
LORELAI,How can you be out of food?,3
LUKE,"Well, it starts with the words, ""Hey Jess, you do the ordering this week, okay?"" and it ends with me selling Kirk a lettuce sandwich.",3
RORY,We've eaten those.,3
LUKE,I'm gonna go pick up some stuff to hold us over  til tomorrow.,3
LORELAI,"Well, get some burgers.",3
RORY,And tater tots.,3
LORELAI,And pickles.,3
LUKE,"Okay, hold on a sec. Burgers, tater tots, pickles. You want cheese on the burger?",3
LORELAI,Cheddar.,3
RORY,And swiss.,3
LUKE,Dessert?,3
LORELAI,Do we have to decide right now?,3
LUKE,I would seriously advise it.,3

FRANCIE,"Paris, good, I so need to talk to you. Are you lost? Listen, first of all, I really wanna commend you on your job as president so far.",3
PARIS,Thank you.,3
FRANCIE,The way you've negotiated on some of those convoluted school issues   mind blowing. I watch in awe.,3
PARIS,Uh huh.,3
FRANCIE,"And that's why this is so hard, because I have major respect for you, and the last thing I ever want is for you to get the wrong impression about my loyalties.",3
PARIS,What are you talking about?,3
FRANCIE,"These were shoved in my locker this morning, and I didn't know what to do, so I thought to myself,  I'll just show them to Paris and I'll explain and she'll understand.'",3
PARIS,Explain what? What is this?,3
FRANCIE,"Rory came to me an d said she wanted to talk about some things. . .you know, policy, the prom, the senior gift, et cetera. So of course I said, ""why don't we talk about them at the student council meet ing with Paris?"" And she said she wanted to do this without Paris. She said Paris is just too wrapped up in that boyfriend of hers to care about any of this. I didn't know what to do, so I went, and then I found these, and I'm just so upset. I mean, I would never intentionally do anything behind your back, Paris. And I promise, the next time Rory tries to get me to, I'm just gonna say,  Talk to the hand', you know what I mean?",3
PARIS,"Yes, I know what you mean.",3
FRANCIE,Are you mad? Say you're not mad. I just couldn't live if I thought you were mad.,3
PARIS,"No, I'm not mad.",3
FRANCIE,,3

MADELINE,Like badminton.,3
LOUISE,Or striptease aerobics.,3
RORY,What?,3
MADELINE,"It's really big in L.A. You just go through the motions, you don't actually have to strip.",3
RORY,Do the other people in the gym throw money at you?,3
LOUISE,"Fine, mock, but tell me this   have you ever seen an overweight stripper?",3
RORY,"The word no seems so wildly inadequate all of a sudden. Hey, where have you been?",3
PARIS,Washing my hands.,3
RORY,Okay.,3
TEACHERory,"All right everyone, take your places. We will warm up with your counter-sixte-riposte- quarte. Melanie, please lead the group.",3
MADELINE,"Oh my God, there's a hair in mine.",3
LOUISE,"Just close your eyes and think of England, honey.",3
RORY,Doesn't it seem strange to be practicing a sport whose original purpose was to k*ll people? It's like if high schools of the future had teams in a*tillery or high altitude bombing or something.,3
TEACHERory,Beginning salute. En garde. Right side advance.,3
RORY,You okay?,3
TEACHERory,Right side retreat.,3
PARIS,Why do you ask?,3
TEACHERory,And lunge.,3
RORY,You just seem weird.,3
TEACHERory,Left side advance.,3
RORY,"Easy there, Paris.",3
TEACHERory,Left side retreat.,3
PARIS,"We're fencing Rory, not playing patty cake.",3
TEACHERory,And lunge.,3
PARIS,"You know, it's interesting how you think you know someone.",3
TEACHERory,"Right side, quarte lunge.",3
PARIS,"Trust a person, rely on a person, then turn around one day and realize you'd been had. Ever experience that?",3
TEACHERory,Ripost.,3
RORY,Paris.,3
PARIS,I hate being had.,3
RORY,Why are you telling me this? You're not supposed to be parrying that hard.,3
PARIS,"Gee, I'm sorry. Maybe I should turn around so you can just stick it directly into my back.",3
RORY,What are you talking about?,3
PARIS,I saw the pictures.,3
RORY,What pictures?,3
PARIS,You know what pictures.,3
RORY,Obviously I don't know what pictures.,3
PARIS,The pictures of you and Francie.,3
RORY,Me and Francie?,3
PARIS,You and Francie in the parking garage talking about me.,3
RORY,"Paris, I  ",3
PARIS,Don't make that face at me!,3
RORY,What face? I'm wearing a mask.,3
PARIS,"The ""I'm Rory, don't you want to pet me?"" face. I know you two have been meeting behind my back.",3
RORY,We haven't. We met once.,3
PARIS,"Aha, you admit it.",3
RORY,"Yes, but it wasn't what you think.",3
PARIS,Brutus!,3
RORY,"Paris, you have to listen to me. Francie wanted to meet, she said she wanted to call a truce. She took those pictures of us, she's setting me up, she's trying to manipulate you.",3
PARIS,Of course she is. You think I don't know when someone's trying to manipulate me? But that doesn't change the fact that you met with her behind my back.,3
RORY,I was trying to help you.,3
PARIS,"You were? You mean, in between betraying me and selling me out, you were trying to help me? Gee, you are quite the Renaissance woman, aren't you?",3
RORY,Stop it!,3
PARIS,,3
RORY,I still can't believe it. I can't believe I got sucked in like that.,3
LORELAI,"Ugh, that Francie is pure evil, so she'll probably wind up president.",3
RORY,Paris is so upset. She totally thinks I betrayed her.,3
LORELAI,She'll calm down.,3
RORY,Paris has never calmed down.,3
LORELAI,She'll calm down.,3
RORY,I can't believe I was her best friend. I feel awful.,3
LORELAI,"Look, I'll tell you what. If you wanna make things right, just go back to school tomorrow and let her s*ab you.",3
RORY,Great idea.,3
LORELAI,I'm nothing if not full of suggestions.,3
RORY,Or full of something.,3
RORY,Hey Grandma.,3
LORELAI,Hi Mom.,3
EMILY,"Come in , it's cold.",3
LORELAI,"Do you want me to talk to her? You know, arrange a sit-down?",3
RORY,"No, thanks.",3
LORELAI,"Come on. We'll have it in an Italian restaurant. You'll get up, go to the bathroom   thanks   and come out sh**ting, and then I'll send you to Italy.",3
RORY,"Well, I do wanna go to Italy.",3
LORELAI,"Two birds with one stone, my friend.",3
LORELAI,"Is everything okay, Mom?",3
EMILY,Of course it's okay. Why wouldn't it be okay?,3
LORELAI,I don't know. You just seem a little quiet.,3
EMILY,"Do I? I guess I do. I don't really have a lot to say, actually. I know, why don't I read to you instead.",3
LORELAI,"Huh, what's that?",3
EMILY,"This? Nothing, just your deposition.",3
LORELAI,My. . .how did you get  ,3
EMILY,"Shh. Listen, it's fun. Okay. ""Question   Would you say your mother is a tolerant woman?""",3
LORELAI,Oh boy.,3
EMILY,"""Answer   Um, well, sure.""",3
LORELAI,What? I said you were.,3
EMILY,You said sure.,3
LORELAI,Which to most people means yes.,3
EMILY,"Yes, to most people, it does, but I've heard you say sure, and your sure is always sarcastic.",3
LORELAI,I do not have a sarcastic sure. . .do I?,3
RORY,Pick spot on carpet and stare.,3
EMILY,"""Question   Why has your mother dismissed maids in the past?""",3
LORELAI,Mom.,3
EMILY,"""Answer   Different reasons.""",3
LORELAI,"Well, that's true, right?",3
EMILY,"""Can you expand on that? Answer   Gee, how much time do you have?""",3
LORELAI,"Okay, see  ",3
EMILY,"""I mean, if you guys have a lunch or an afternoon squash game or something. . .you look like the kind of guys who play squash. And hey, why's it called squash? Is it something to do with the fruit? Or vegetable, right? A squash is a vegetable, though if you ask me, it's gross no matter what you call it. Well, anyway, what I'm saying is you might want to clear your afternoon.""",3
LORELAI,I was flustered. He was using lawyer tricks.,3
RORY,By asking you to expand?,3
LORELAI,Now you decide to pipe in?,3
EMILY,"Didn't I tell you this was important, Lorelai?",3
LORELAI,"Yes, you did.",3
EMILY,"So, in spite of the fact that I told you it was important, you couldn't find it in your heart to put aside your personal antagonism toward me for one day and help me out.",3
LORELAI,"Mom, this is not fair. I said a lot of nice things about you in there.",3
EMILY,"Oh really? ""Would you say your mother sets impossible goals which people cannot help butfail to reach, thereby reinforcing her already formed opinion of their deficiencies? Answer   Only for her daughter.""",3
LORELAI,"Okay, not there, but keep flipping.",3
MAID,"I'm sorry to interrupt, but dinner is ready Mrs. Gilmore.",3
LORELAI,"Dinner, hey! Dinner's ready. Who's hungry besides me? I'd keep it warm. We're gonna be here awhile. Okay, go ahead.",3
EMILY,"""Would you call your mother an extremely critical woman? Long pause."" Why was there a long pause, Lorelai?",3
LORELAI,"Because I was deliberately trying to hurt you, Mom.",3
EMILY,"""On a scale from one to ten, what would you rate your mother in terms of compassion for others' feelings?"" Wanna guess what she said?",3
RORY,"No, thank you.",3
LORELAI,Mom.,3
EMILY,"Hang on a second, Lorelai. I just want to skip to the Ben Hur reference.",3

JACKSON,"Sookie, I'm home. I got the -",3
SOOKIE,Surprise!,3
JACKSON,What is this?,3
SOOKIE,I made you dinner.,3
JACKSON,It smells terrific.,3
SOOKIE,"Lamb chops with Sicilian olives, rosemary and garlic, and a warm potato and chorizo salad.",3
JACKSON,"I love lamb chops with Sicilian olives, rosemary and garlic, and a warm potato and chorizo salad.",3
SOOKIE,I know.,3
JACKSON,What's that?,3
SOOKIE,Beef jerky.,3
JACKSON,You made beef jerky for me.,3
SOOKIE,"And there's cornbread, and fried marshmallow pie for dessert.",3
JACKSON,And you have CCR o n.,3
SOOKIE,"Well, you like CCR.",3
JACKSON,"I know I like CCR, you don't like CCR.",3
SOOKIE,"Sometimes I like CCR, and tonight I like CCR.",3
JACKSON,You cheated on me!,3
SOOKIE,No.,3
JACKSON,Oh my God.,3
SOOKIE,I just flirted accidentally!,3
JACKSON,Turn it off.,3
SOOKIE,Let me exp lain.,3
JACKSON,"Every time I hear it now, it'll remind me that my wife cheated on me.",3
SOOKIE,Flirted   accidentally!,3
JACKSON,,3
RORY,I'm going to bed.,3
LORELAI,At nine-thirty?,3
RORY,"Yeah, well, going a whole day without talking to anyone is a lot more tiring than you think.",3
LORELAI,I hate those girls.,3
RORY,"It's fine. It was the first lunch that didn't start with a recitation of the calorie content of everything on the table, so actually it was kind of a relief.",3
LORELAI,I hate them anyhow.,3
RORY,Night.,3
LORELAI,Night babe.,3
LORELAI,Hello?,3
ALEX,"Lorelai, it's Alex Lesman. We met at The Learning Center the other day. My friendaccidentally asked your friend out on a date.",3
LORELAI,"Um, right, hi.",3
ALEX,How are ya?,3
LORELAI,I'm good.,3
ALEX,Fat Sal sends his love.,3
LORELAI,Right back at him.,3
ALEX,"Look, I know this must seem kind of out of the blue. You're probably wondering how I got your number.",3
LORELAI,Information?,3
ALEX,"No, that would've been far too logical. I actually called your inn. I was gonna leave a message, but this French guy just gave me your home number. Said I shouldn't worry about calling too late, that you usually stay up  til three, four in the morning.",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, don't worry about him, he's getting fired tomorrow. So, what's up?",3
ALEX,"Well, I was wondering something.",3
LORELAI,Uh huh. . .,3
ALEX,"On weekends, I like to go to different coffee shops, try their coffee, look at what they're doing.",3
LORELAI,See if there's anything you can steal and possibly disguise as your own?,3
ALEX,"Exactly, kind of a low-rent corporate espionage. Anyway, sometimes I'll hit two coffee shops that have surprisingly similar product, and I for the life of me cannot decide which one is better.",3
LORELAI,Bummer .,3
ALEX,"Yes, bummer , so I thought it would really help to have another person there who could help me mak e these crucial evaluations.",3
LORELAI,Interesting solution to a fascinating problem.,3
ALEX,So I was wondering what you were doing this Saturday.,3
LORELAI,"You know, it's funny you should ask me this, because I just happen to be one of the world's foremost coffee experts.",3
ALEX,Really?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, it's basically just me and this guy named Chuckles in Brazil.",3
ALEX,"Sounds like fate. So, what do you say?",3
LORELAI,Sure.,3
ALEX,,3
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, I got that.",3
ALEX,Good.,3
LORELAI,"So, you guys come up with a name for your place yet?",3
ALEX,"Right now, the top contender is Sludge.",3
LORELAI,Excuse me?,3
ALEX,"Moving on, my partner likes Regular Joe.",3
LORELAI,Huh.,3
ALEX,"Then again, his name is Joe.",3
LORELAI,"Well, fancy that.",3
ALEX,"So, still won't let go of The Mudhouse, huh?",3
LORELAI,Afraid not. What else you got?,3
ALEX,"Well, okay, how about Black Liquid Hope Sold Here?",3

RORY,Well.,3
LORELAI,I'd say three years.,3
RORY,I'd say more like four.,3
LORELAI,What? It has not been four years since we've stepped foot inside our own garage.,3
RORY,It was when we got the Jeep.,3
LORELAI,"That wasn't. . .yes, it was.",3
RORY,"And even then, I think we only got as far as opening the door before something flew out and scared you.",3
LORELAI,"Yes, it scared me w hile you stood by calmly like Dr. Dolittle chatting with the bat.",3
RORY,"It was a bat, wasn't it?",3
LORELAI,"Wearing an OzzFest T-shit, I believe.",3
RORY,Will the man never be able to live that down?,3
LORELAI,"Well, Joe Namath will forever be wearing pantyhose.",3
RORY,"True, very true.",3
LORELAI,"So, uh, what do we do about the bat cave?",3
RORY,"Well, we did promise Lane that her band could rehearse here.",3
LORELAI,"Yes, we did.",3
RORY,And they'll probably need to actually get in there to do so.,3
Posted,02/09/03 12:09,3
LORELAI,So I guess we're going in.,3
RORY,I guess we are.,3
LORELAI,"All right. On three   one, two, three.",3
RORY,Ah!,3
LORELAI,"What, what is it?",3
RORY,Those are the boxes from our attic that you were supposed to give away two years ago.,3
LORELAI,What?,3
RORY,I spent three days boxing all the stuff in the attic and you were going to call a charity and get someone to pick them up.,3
LORELAI,"I made an appointment, the guy didn't show.",3
RORY,He didn't?,3
LORELAI,"No, I don't think.",3
RORY,Unbelievable.,3
LORELAI,"Look, I got bored after sitting there two hours, so I left a note saying the stuff was in the garage and he could leave a receipt, and I went to get some coffee.",3
RORY,These guys aren't just allowed to go into someone's garage.,3
LORELAI,"Well, the note said it was okay.",3
RORY,"Well, how did he know that the note was authentic?",3
LORELAI,"I wrote it on Powerpuff Girls stationery. Who'd he think was setting him up, Hello Kitty?",3
RORY,I can't believe how much junk we have.,3
LORELAI,"Hey, these are   these are souvenirs from our life's journey, girly girl. This is not junk. Okay, this is junk, and that over there is junk. All right, basically everything I'm looking at is, yeah, junk.",3
RORY,We're pack rats.,3
LORELAI,"We're Sanford and Son. Yuck, bye bye.",3
RORY,Wait!,3
LORELAI,What?,3
RORY,Hug-a-World!,3
LORELAI,What?,3
RORY,"Hug-a-World, it's my Hug-a-World.",3
LORELAI,Where's the world?,3
RORY,It's faded.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, wait, I can see something.",3
RORY,Canada.,3
LORELAI,"Canada, nice. Okay.",3
RORY,What are you doing?,3
LORELAI,I'm throwing it out.,3
RORY,You can't throw out Hug-a-World.,3
LORELAI,"I'm not throwing out Hug-a-World, I'm throwing out Hug-a-Canada.",3
RORY,"I learned my seven continents on Hug-a-World, don't you remember? We used to squeeze it as tight as we could and then wherever our pinkies would end up, that's where we were going to go together when I grew up.",3
LORELAI,"Yes, many a trip to Uzbekistan was planned that way.",3
RORY,"We can clean him up and keep him, can't we?",3
LORELAI,Throw him outside and I'll see what I can do.,3
RORY,Thank you.,3
LORELAI,"If I clean up Hug-a-World, does that cancel out me not getting rid of the boxers?",3
RORY,I'll consider it a wash.,3
LORELAI,How about if I chase it and bring it back?,3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,Hug-a-World would like to see the world.,3
RORY,It's moving.,3
LORELAI,There's something living there besides Canadians.,3
RORY,"I hugged it, I hugged it really tight.",3
LORELAI,"Yes, you did.",3
RORY,I have to shower!,3
LORELAI,,3
LUKE,Can I take. . .Can I take. . .What can I get. . . That's it.,3
TAYLORory,I specifically requested a carved arch above the door.,3
TOM,"It's a blueprint, Taylor.",3
TAYLORory,"Yes, Tom, I know it's a blueprint.",3
LUKE,Taylor!,3
TAYLORory,"One second, Luke. I know it's a blueprint, Tom, but if I don't see a carved archway here, then I don't expect to see a carved archway there, and if I don't see an archway there, then you won't see a paycheck here. Are we clear?",3
TOM,"Get away from my saw, Taylor.",3
LUKE,What the hell is going on?,3
TAYLORory,I'm renovating your building. You know that very well.,3
LUKE,I also know that the renovation is supposed to be going on over there inside the building.,3
TAYLORory,There is plenty of room to move around if you turn sideways.,3
LUKE,I'm gonna punch you in the nose.,3
TAYLORory,I have every right to make the necessary renovations to the building that I am paying good money to lease.,3
LUKE,"Taylor, if any other person in this town pulled a stunt like this in front of your market, you'd have them arrested.",3
TAYLORory,"I have acquired all the necessary permits to do exactly what I'm doing, and all of this has been looked over and approved by the town magistrate.",3
LUKE,You're the town magistrate!,3
TAYLORory,"And as such, if you have any complaints about me, you may take them up with me.",3
TOM,Get him away from my saw.,3
LUKE,Get him away from my diner.,3
TAYLORory,"By the way, Luke, I noticed you hadn't returned any of my lawyer's calls about the lease agreement. Now we have to set up an appointment to see that those papers get signed.",3
LUKE,"Forget it. I'm not going through any lawyer. You want those papers signed, you pick them up and you walk them over to me. Then, I'll sign them.",3
TAYLORory,"Luke, this is business. It needs to be done properly and legally.",3
LUKE,"It's a standard lease form, Taylor. I bought it at Office Depot.",3
TAYLORory,"All the more reason to have a professional take a little looksee, huh? I mean, there's a reason they say good lawyers make for good neighbors.",3
LUKE,Who the hell said that?,3
TAYLORory,"Oh, everybody says that. Okay, now back to work. Tom, let's take another look at this archway, shall we?",3
TOM,,3
LORELAI,"I already talked to the neighbors. Just make sure you keep the doors closed, and the music must stop by eight.",3
LANE,"Don't worry, I have to be home by six.",3
ZACH,"We'll be done by eight, don't you worry.",3
LORELAI,I won't.,3
ZACH,"Okay, okay, okay, Lorelai, okay.",3
LORELAI,"Uh, so, um, Rory showed you the key. Uh, you're welcome to anything in the kitchen, which is nothing, but, uh, the water's yours for the taking. Just replace the bottle if it's out.",3
ZACH,"You ask, I will obey.",3
LORELAI,Super.,3
BRIAN,I'm out!,3
LORELAI,He's out! I'll get you some mo re!,3
LANE,"Oh, no, no, don't worry about it. I'll get it.",3
LORELAI,"Okay. Oh, excuse me. Do you need any help?",3
RORY,No.,3
LORELAI,"Do you need any help, please?",3
RORY,"I'm good, Pamela Des Barres.",3
LORELAI,When did you turn on Mommy?,3
RORY,What? He's cute.,3
LORELAI,Rory.,3
RORY,"And you know, if you latch on now, you're totally entitled to half of everything when he dumps you after he's famous.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, um, since you don't need any help, simply a new place to live, I'm gonna just go.",3
ZACH,Listen. . .,3
LORELAI,"You're back, okay, hi.",3
ZACH,"We're gonna be playing a gig next month, and I think you'd really get into it.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, well, I'd love to get into it, Zach, but see, I have this medical condition where I can't listen to music.",3
ZACH,You can't?,3
LORELAI,"No. My ears, the hollow tubey thing inside is very tiny and it will literally explode if I listen to anything loud and musical.",3
ZACH,That sucks.,3
LORELAI,"I know. Thanks for the invite, I'm sure it's gonna be great. Uh, so, uh, you guys have a good rehearsal. I'm gonna go on inside and write to Tipper. Great gal. See you guys later.",3
RORY,Bye Pam.,3
ZACH,She is some kind of fine.,3
BRIAN,"Zach, some help would be great.",3
ZACH,Relax.,3
LANE,I still can't believe you guys are letting us rehearse here.,3
RORY,You can thank us in the liner notes.,3
LANE,"Right under our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.",3
RORY,"That's some good billing. So, are you guys actually playing a gig next month?",3
LANE,Abby Berland's birthday party. Her parents are letting her have a band.,3
RORY,That'd be great.,3
LANE,Cross your fingers she doesn't wreck the car again and her mother doesn't cancel it before we get to play.,3
RORY,I'll hide the keys myself.,3
BRIAN,"Okay, I'm done.",3
DAVE,Me too.,3
ZACH,Let's do this.,3
DAVE,"Listen, Lane, we need to talk a sec.",3
LANE,Sure.,3
DAVE,"Now that we finally have a real rehearsal space, we can get serious about the sound.",3
LANE,Absolutely.,3
DAVE,Which means that I'm gonna need you to really step it up a little.,3
LANE,Oh.,3
DAVE,"I mean, you've got the potential, but you're sloppy. I need a clean roll on the toms but powerful, like Moon.",3
LANE,Okay.,3
DAVE,"I know you're a girl, but I need you to play like a guy.",3
LANE,I understand.,3
DAVE,"And if you can't, if that's too hard. . .",3
LANE,"No, that's not too hard. I'll be better, I promise.",3
DAVE,Okay.,3
RORY,"Okay, please take this the way it's intended, but I am going to kick Dave in the shins repeatedly for the next hour and a half.",3
LANE,Why?,3
RORY,"Why? Did you hear the way he was talking to you? ""Play like a guy, Lane."" Well, cry like a girl, Dave! What? Why are you smiling like that?",3
LANE,He fooled you.,3
RORY,What?,3
LANE,We thought the other guys might be catching on about me and Dave so we came up with this plan.,3
RORY,That he become a jer k?,3
LANE,"Yes. If the other guys see him talking down to me like that, they will totally be thrown off track.",3
RORY,"Okay, but doesn't it bother you to hear him talk to you like that?",3
LANE,"No way. Believe me, he knows I play better, harder, Moonier than any guy they could possibly find, plus I smell better.",3
RORY,"Okay, as long as you're fine with it.",3
LANE,"I am, I'm fine with it.",3
DAVE,"And also Lane, I need four strong downbeats, not two strong ones and two whatever ones. You set the tone, Lane. If you suck, we suck.",3
LANE,,3
ALEX,"Okay, now this is the Sumatra blend. It's supposed to be a little sharper than the Colombian.",3
LORELAI,"You know, this is pretty much what I thought heaven would look like. There might have been a unicorn in the corner, but basically   yeah, this is it. Um, so I've had fifteen of these tiny coffees.",3
ALEX,"Yes, you have.",3
LORELAI,And you're telling me that all this tasting is completely free?,3
ALEX,Yes.,3
LORELAI,So I'm a cheap date.,3
ALEX,"Well, the tasting is free, but I have to promise to stock my coffee chain from this warehouse, so actually this date is costing me ab out eleven thousand dollars a month.",3
LORELAI,"Geez, I hope I'm worth it.",3
ALEX,"So far, so good.",3
LORELAI,So you were telling me ab out Hillary and Jeff.,3
ALEX,"Right. Well, they live with their mom, but I get them quite a bit. They both recently started soccer because apparently it's the law.",3
LORELAI,"I know. Rory's still got an outstanding warrant on that one. So, how old are they?",3
ALEX,Six and nine.,3
LORELAI,Good ages.,3
ALEX,Haven't really hit a bad one yet.,3
LORELAI,"Me either. Although, with Rory, I think it's gonna be forty-three.",3
ALEX,Really?,3
LORELAI,"Not sure why, just have a feeling that's the year she's getting the mohawk. Mm, we like sharper. When you guys open your coffee place, this must be on the menu.",3
ALEX,"Yeah? Mm, that's sharper.",3
LORELAI,"So, let's see, we've covered work, kids. . .uh, shall we move onto hobbies?",3
ALEX,Not a hobby guy.,3
LORELAI,Hallelujah.,3
ALEX,"Most of the time I'm working, with the kids, or I'm charming the chicks with the coffee. And then a few times a year, I'll go camping or fishing. I actually really love that stuff.",3
LORELAI,Oh yeah?,3
ALEX,Absolutely. How about you?,3
LORELAI,"Ah, there's a reason they call it the great outdoors, right?",3
ALEX,I was actually thinking of doing a little fishing this Saturday.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, that sounds like fun.",3
ALEX,"This great place, beautiful, perfect fishing. You wanna come?",3
LORELAI,Huh?,3
ALEX,I'd love to take you.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, sure. That would be nice.",3
ALEX,"Great, it's a date.",3
LORELAI,"Yes, it is a date. It is a fishing date.",3
ALEX,Ready to try another? I hear there's one from Peru that comes with a Surgeon's General warning.,3
LORELAI,"Hey, if that last one didn't k*ll me, nothing will.",3
ALEX,,3
LANE,"Rory! Rory! The numbers are all adding up, the planets are aligning, and I am going to my senior prom!",3
RORY,What?,3
LANE,Yes!,3
RORY,How?,3
LANE,"Because I am brilliant. See, my mom was in a good mood today because she made a big sale   a dining room table and eight chairs, none of which matched, that have been hanging around the shop since I was four.",3
RORY,"Oh, I'm gonna miss those.",3
LANE,"Get over it. Anyway, I sat her down and I told her that I really wanted to go to the prom. And I know she doesn't approve of such things, but if she lets me go, we will do it her way.",3
RORY,But her way would be not to let you go.,3
LANE,"Yes, she said that also. But then I went on to clarify that if she lets me go, she would get full dress approval, full chaperone approval, I promise not to actually dance at the prom, and whatever boy I go with will be required to attend at least four family dinners before she signs off on him being my escort.",3
RORY,Nice move on using the word escort instead of the word date.,3
LANE,"The subliminal is half the battle, Rory.",3
RORY,"Go on, go on.",3
LANE,"So, she sat there, took it all in, and after a really long pause, she looks at me and says, ""Maybe.""",3
RORY,You got a maybe from Mrs. Kim.,3
LANE,I got a maybe from Mrs. Kim.,3
LANE,"Okay, let's start with base.",3
RORY,"Right. Now, we are talking Dave taking you to the prom, right?",3
LANE,Of course. My mom loves him. Last week she let him sit in our pew.,3
RORY,No.,3
LANE,She made me mo ve.,3
RORY,You've been replaced.,3
LANE,"I'd be offended if I weren't so busy doing a happy dance. It's all working out so perfectly. By the time she says yes, she'll love him even more and then when I say I wanna go to the prom with him, it'll be like she picked him out herself.",3
RORY,"You are brilliant. Hey, Kirk, is this waterproof?",3
KIRK,Water-resistant.,3
RORY,Thanks.,3
LANE,"You know, she asked Dave to play at the wedding this weekend.",3
RORY,I thought I was the only non-Korean allowed at the Kim family weddings.,3
LANE,"Don't be hurt. You have been to so many of these weddings, you are an honorary member of the clan now.",3
RORY,"I appreciate that. So, tell me, your cousin getting married Saturday, what's his story?",3
LANE,"James. Very quiet, kind of skulky, couldn't meet anyone here, so his family arranged to have a girl shipped over from the old country.",3
RORY,I hope they cut air holes in the box.,3
LANE,She doesn't speak a word of English and she's never met him.,3
RORY,"Hm. Well, then she's gonna need some sparkles.",3
LANE,"Okay, I think that's it.",3
RORY,Let's go. Can you imagine marrying someone you didn't know?,3
LANE,Are you kidding? Used clothes still skeeve me out a little.,3
KIRK,Will this be all?,3
RORY,Yes. I like your display Kirk.,3
KIRK,"It is fun, isn't it? Okay, that's $40.42.",3
LANE,Here.,3
KIRK,"I'm also including a few samples, a facial scrub and a honey mask. Very soothing, very healing.",3
RORY,That's very nice.,3
KIRK,"Thank you for coming, and call me and tell me how you like that mask.",3
RORY,We will.,3
LANE,"Okay, the wedding's at four, so how about you come over at one and we'll get her ready?",3
RORY,Deal.,3
LANE,"You know, Rory, I feel good. I feel like everything's going my way this time.",3
RORY,I hope so.,3
LANE,"No, it is, I can feel it. Lane Kim is going to her prom.",3
RORY,,3
LORELAI,"Dumb, dumb, dumb.",3
SOOKIE,"Oh, come on.",3
LORELAI,"Sure, I fish. I also bodysurf and walk on the moon without a space suit.",3
SOOKIE,You were trying to impress him.,3
LORELAI,Ugh.,3
SOOKIE,What ugh? You like him.,3
LORELAI,"I like him, but I'm not sixteen. I don't lie to guys to make them like me. I just got stuck when he said fishing and camping, and I was trying to be nice and not say, ""Fishing? Great   cold, wet, and smelly. My three favorite things after those witches from Macbeth.""",3
SOOKIE,"Honey, we all do it. When Jackson and I first started dating, we went to this pickling festival, and he wore a shirt with a giant frog on it. So I'm trying to make conversation and I say, ""Hey, cute frog."" And he says, ""You like frogs?"" and I say, ""I love frogs!"" So, for our six-month anniversary, he gives me a f rog figurine.",3
LORELAI,Aw.,3
SOOKIE,"And then when Christmas came, he gave me another frog figurine. And then he told his family what to get me, and all of a sudden. . .",3
LORELAI,Your frog collection!,3
SOOKIE,I'm the frog girl.,3
LORELAI,You never told him you don't love frogs?,3
SOOKIE,"No. He has the best time buying them for me, so I just let him buy them.",3
LORELAI,That's sweet. Maybe I could go fishing. Maybe. Once.,3
SOOKIE,Tell me ab out Alex.,3
LORELAI,"Well, he owns an iron company. They do gates and statues, big fancy stuff. He's divorced, he has two kids he's crazy about. He's nice, he drinks a lot of coffee. It's all good, it all works.",3
SOOKIE,So?,3
LORELAI,So. . .I'm going fishing. I'm the fish girl.,3
SOOKIE,,3
LOUISE,"I don't know what to do. It's time to break up, but he seems so happy.",3
MADELINE,You could date his brother.,3
LOUISE,"I guess, but that's so  been there, done that.'",3
MADELINE,We could switch.,3
LOUISE,Isn't that how I got him?,3
MADELINE,"Oh yeah. Wow, it really is time to go to college.",3
ADVISORory,"Rory, where is Paris?",3
RORY,I don't know.,3
ADVISORory,She's almost fifteen minutes late.,3
RORY,Is she?,3
ADVISORory,"All right. Well, perhaps we should start without her. You can convene the meeting.",3
RORY,"Okay. If everyone will take their seats, we can call this meeting to order. All right, since Paris isn't here  ",3
PARIS,"Paris is here. Couldn't wait to jump in there and take over, could you?",3
RORY,Tell it to the Timex salesman.,3
PARIS,"My gavel, please? I call this meeting to order.",3
RORY,I already did that.,3
PARIS,"Sorry I'm late, but I had some very important business to attend to. Business which I must now, unfortunately, share with all of you. At the beginning of this year, when we were sworn in as your government representatives, we placed our hand on a bible and we took an oath. An oath that stated that our behavior would be ethically and morally upstanding for as long as we were serving in public office. And that is why it saddens me greatly today to inform you that one of our own has forsaken that holy oath.",3
MADELINE,I hate anything that starts with a speech.,3
ADVISORory,"What are you talking about, Paris?",3
PARIS,I hold in my hand evidence accusing one Rory Gilmore of commit ting high crimes and misdemeanors.,3
RORY,What?,3
ADVISORory,"Paris, what's going on here?",3
PARIS,Miss Gilmore has been conspiring with the various factions of this school to weaken the efficacy of this administration.,3
RORY,"You're really pathetic, you know that?",3
PARIS,You'll have your chance to address these charges when I'm done.,3
RORY,What charges?,3
PARIS,"First on the list, espionage.",3
RORY,Espionage?,3
PARIS,Gathering privileged information and divulging it to the enemy.,3
RORY,"What privileged information? Prom colors are green and pink, pass it on?",3
PARIS,"Next on our list, the most serious crime   treason.",3
RORY,I'm sorry I talked about Jamie.,3
PARIS,And having a big mouth. That's going on the list also.,3
RORY,I can't believe you're taking all of this out on me. What about Francie?,3
PARIS,"Francie was not my second in command. Francie was not privy to the innermost workings of my personal. That is, not until you made her privy.",3
RORY,"Everyone in school saw you walking with Jamie, Paris.",3
PARIS,I'm still talking.,3
RORY,She already knew!,3
ADVISORory,Enough! We've heard enough.,3
PARIS,I move to put to a vote the impeachment of Rory Gilmore.,3
RORY,Hey!,3
ADVISORory,"Miss Gellar, I'm sorry, but we do not impeach here at Chilton.",3
PARIS,Why not?,3
ADVISORory,Because this is a student government.,3
PARIS,"Well, then, I'd like to put to a vote a resolution to instate the ability to impeach.",3
ADVISORory,No.,3
PARIS,Then she should resign.,3
RORY,"I'm not going to resign. You have the problem, you resign.",3
PARIS,"No, you resign!",3
RORY,"No, you resign!",3
PARIS,"No, you resign!",3
ADVISORory,No one is resigning.,3
LOUISE,Maybe I'll stay with him  til Friday and see how it goes.,3
MADELINE,That sounds fair.,3
ADVISORory,"You two can take this argument somewhere else. This is student council. Real school matters are the only things that matter here. Now, Paris, move on.",3
PARIS,,3
NICOLE,"Excuse me? Hi, I'm looking for a Mr. Lucas Danes.",3
JESS,"Oh, Lucas.",3
LUKE,What?,3
JESS,IRS.,3
NICOLE,I'm not IRS. I'm not IRS.,3
LUKE,I'm Luke Danes.,3
NICOLE,"Luke Danes, sorry. Well, hello Luke Danes, I'm Nicole Leahy, I'm Taylor Doose's attorney.",3
LUKE,"Oh, geez.",3
NICOLE,He wanted me to bring  ,3
LUKE,"Yeah, the lease agreements, yes, I know. I told him to walk them over here, but hey, what's the fun of being Taylor, right?",3
NICOLE,I'm sorry if this is a bad time. It certainly won't take me very long.,3
LUKE,"Nah, I'm fine, whatever. Let's get this over with.",3
NICOLE,No problem.,3
LUKE,You want some coffee?,3
NICOLE,"Yeah, sounds great. I really just need to witness your signature, is all. It's actually just a formality.",3
LUKE,"In other words, completely ridiculous and unnecessary.",3
NICOLE,Uh huh.,3
LUKE,Okay.,3
NICOLE,Mr. Doose really likes things to be formal. And neat. And in triplicate. He just loves things in triplicate. That's a really good cup of coffee.,3
LUKE,"Thanks. So, tell me something, what's it like being Taylor's lawyer?",3
NICOLE,"Well, actually, I'm not exactly Mr. Doose's lawyer. Or only lawyer. He's one of our select clients, so all of our attorneys deal with him or a rotating basis, it's my month.",3
LUKE,My condolences.,3
NICOLE,"Yeah, my father always told me that which does not k*ll you makes you stronger.",3
LUKE,You're gonna be really stronger.,3
NICOLE,He's not that bad.,3
LUKE,"Seriously, if you run into someone pinned underneath a truck, pick it up. It's gonna be a piece of cake. Okay, looks like that's the whole nine yards.",3
NICOLE,"Great. You and Mr. Doose are officially in business together. Oh, I'm so sorry, I meant thatas a good thing.",3
LUKE,It's okay.,3
NICOLE,"Uh, I will let you get back to work. Let me. . .",3
LUKE,"No, no, on me.",3
NICOLE,"Tell you what. It's business, let's let Mr. Doose pay for it.",3
LUKE,Even better.,3
JESS,"Well, that was an interesting show.",3
LUKE,What are you yammer ing about?,3
JESS,Guess Gloria Allred wants to go slummin g.,3
LUKE,Shut up.,3
JESS,She was totally coming onto you.,3
LUKE,She was not.,3
JESS,Couldn't you hear her panting when you were signing those things?,3
LUKE,Didn't see it.,3
JESS,"She laughed at your jokes, and we both know there's gotta be some ulterior motive when people laugh at your jokes.",3
LUKE,"Okay, whatever. Even if there was something, which I'm not saying there was, she's a suit. Not my type.",3
JESS,"Yeah, especially since she's not a monk.",3
LUKE,"Oh, I don't go out that much, is that what that's supposed to mean?",3
JESS,"Take a look at a calendar. When was the last time you went out on a date? A year, two years ago?",3
LUKE,"Last month, wiseass. I went out with Joanna Cooper.",3
JESS,You gave her a ride home.,3
LUKE,A ride home is the end of a date.,3
JESS,Only if you go on a date first.,3
LUKE,I'm not gonna discuss this with you.,3
JESS,"Suit yourself. I have to go meet Rory anyhow. See, I'm gonna go pick her up, spend a few hours actually being with her, then give her a ride home. That's called the end of a date.",3
LUKE,Or I could stay open a few hours later which means you're here  til ten. That's also called the end of a date.,3
JESS,Hopeless.,3
LUKE,,3
LORELAI,"Hey, got any good stories?",3
LUKE,"Nope, sorry.",3
LORELAI,"Ah, nothing? No crazy, colorful uncle? Best friend with a funny name?",3
LUKE,Jeff Smith?,3
LORELAI,Skeletons in the family closet? w*r wounds? Funny shaped scars?,3
LUKE,"It really throws you off when Rory's late, doesn't it?",3
LORELAI,Big time.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, yay, thank God!",3
RORY,Sorry. Didn't Luke keep you company?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, he tried, but really, he's got nothing.",3
LUKE,Thank you.,3
LORELAI,So what's with all the books?,3
RORY,We are going to fish.,3
LORELAI,With these?,3
RORY,Yes.,3
LORELAI,So we throw them in and try to knock the fish out?,3
RORY,I went to the library and got of all their best informational books on fishing.,3
LORELAI,"Ugh, you're serious.",3
RORY,"You wanna learn to fish or not? Exciting, huh?",3
LORELAI,"Oh, I can barely keep still. ""Chapter 1, technique. For deep water fishing, an angler   "" What's an angler?",3
RORY,That would be you.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, better rememb er that. Okay. ""For deep water fishing, an angler""   me, again   ""can choose a wire line using a downrigger or a vertical jig. Whatever your technique, the other successful clue to attracting fish is the appropriate lure."" Ooh, what about the sequined top I wore to the Christmas party?",3
RORY,"Yes, I think that's exactly what he's talking about.",3
LORELAI,"""For bottom feeders, consider smaller, darker patterned lures""   simple, yet elegant   ""while in areas where the forage fish are cicso, you're limited to the larger, more flashy baits."" I am telling you right now, the larger flashy baits are just gonna make me look cheap.",3
RORY,"Okay, let's review   what do we know so far?",3
LORELAI,"I need flashy baits if I'm going to invest in cisco, unless I choose to cast a troll in my downrigger.",3
RORY,"Hey, that's good.",3
LUKE,Doing a little studying?,3
RORY,My mom's leaning how to fish.,3
LUKE,You're what?,3
LORELAI,I'm learning how to fish.,3
LUKE,"Oh, sorry, wrong inflection   you're what?",3
LORELAI,Go away.,3
LUKE,Why are you learning how to fish?,3
LORELAI,"Um, it's just something I wanted to do. Some friends of mine fish, and I thought if they can do it I can do it.",3
LUKE,Okay.,3
LORELAI,"And what if I am a really great fisher? Yeah, I mean, what if that's my calling, the thing that I am mean t to do? And all this time I've been sitting here with the gift to fish and I am squandering it. It's like if Mozart walked right by the piano store and never played a note.",3
LUKE,So you're gonna fish to fulfill your destiny?,3
LORELAI,That's right.,3
LUKE,And you're gonna learn to fish to fulfill your destiny from a book?,3
LORELAI,Yes.,3
LUKE,And you sanctioned this?,3
RORY,Yes.,3
LUKE,"Okay, Thelma, Louise, possibly there's another way to learn to fish.",3
LORELAI,The Fishing Channel.,3
LUKE,I fish.,3
RORY,"Oh yeah, we've seen those boots thingies outside drying off.",3
LUKE,Those would be called waders.,3
LORELAI,And I'm sure I'll be reading about waders soon in one of these cliffhangers here.,3
LUKE,"If you want, I can show you a few things, get you started, make sure you don't strangle yourself with your own line, the basics.",3
LORELAI,Are you sure you don't mind?,3
LUKE,I can come over tomorrow after work.,3
LORELAI,"Great, thank you. Agh. Just for the record, I don't wanna learn that.",3
LUKE,,3
RORY,I got a note that I was supposed to come see Headmaster Charleston.,3
SECRETARY,I'll let him know you're both here.,3
RORY,Both?,3
PARIS,Both.,3
RORY,Both.,3
SECRETARY,"Take a seat, please.",3
RORY,"Yes, ma'am. So what this time, trying to have me deported?",3
PARIS,"Oh, yeah, like I'm the one who called this meeting.",3
RORY,I certainly didn't call this meet ing.,3
PARIS,"Save the act for Sundance, you little snitch.",3
RORY,I didn't snitch.,3
PARIS,Said the weak-kneed turncoat.,3
RORY,Nixon's bad seed.,3
PARIS,Daughter of Judas.,3
HEADMASTERory,"Ladies, come in please.",3
HEADMASTERory,"Have a seat. Chilton student council president and vice president in my office. . . not what I would've expected, I must tell you. There's been quite a stir about you two the past several days. The school is buzzing with the talk of your clashes in student council meetings, your face-offs in the cafeteria, a screaming match at the school newspaper's office.",3
PARIS,"Excuse me, Headmaster Charleston, in regards to the incident at the Franklin, Ms. Gilmore submitted a piece that was quite poorly researched.",3
RORY,It was not poorly researched.,3
PARIS,I had to re-edit it and Ms. Gilmore took it very badly.,3
RORY,There was nothing wrong with the piece.,3
PARIS,And in regards to the student council meeting  ,3
RORY,"Oh, you mean the one where you tried to impeach me because you haven't been properly diagnosed yet?",3
PARIS,If you'll just allow me ac cess to my briefs  ,3
RORY,"You know what, you want me to quit? Fine, I'll quit. I never wanted this stupid job in the first place.",3
PARIS,Who forced you to take it then?,3
RORY,"You did, because you didn't think you'd get elected unless I ran with you.",3
PARIS,That's not true!,3
RORY,It's completely true!,3
PARIS,Shut up!,3
RORY,"No, you shut up!",3
HEADMASTERory,"Enough! This behavior will stop this instant. It is disgraceful, especially from the political leaders of this campus. Now, I'd like to know what is actually driving this recent rash of infighting. Oh, goody, I get to guess. Well, let's see, perhaps you're arguing over the same boy?",3
PARIS,"Sure, we're girls, so we could only be arguing about a boy, right? Sexist, white-haired  ",3
HEADMASTERory,"Paris, are you muttering?",3
PARIS,"No, sorry.",3
HEADMASTERory,"All right, if it isn't a boy, perhaps it's a popularity thing. Someone didn't get invited to someone else's party? Or perhaps this is a power struggle of some sort. No? Well, then I'll stop guessing and start lecturing. Ms. Gilmore, you will not be quitting the student council, is that clear?",3
RORY,"Yes, sir.",3
HEADMASTERory,"The student body has elected you and therefore you will fulfill your commitment. And in the future, I would advise you to think long and hard about accepting any responsibility if you intend to run away from it at the first sign of conflict. And Ms. Gellar, you worked very hard to get to the position you hold in this school, and yet now you are willing to throw all that away onpetty vendettas and childish antics. Indeed, it makes me wonder. . .if you two can't resolve your issues in this sheltered   some w ould say pampered   environment, how on Earth will you ever survive in college? As student council officers, you represent Chilton to those inside and outside these hallowed halls. Right now, the world sees us as a group of sniveling, spiteful, vindictive individuals   not really what I'd hoped for, nor is that how I portrayed the two of you in my personal letter of recommen dation to Harvard. I would hate to have to write a second letter to the university correcting my errors in judgment. However, I've done it before. Am I making myself clear?",3
RORY,"Yes, sir.",3
PARIS,"Yes, sir.",3
HEADMASTERory,Delightful. You may see yourselves out.,3
RORY,"Well, that was delightful, wasn't it? I'm not sure which is more embarrassing   having Charleston yell at us or knowing we actually had a ""shut up/no, you shut up"" fight in front of him. So, what do you think, Paris? Do you feel as completely rotten as I do?",3
PARIS,,3
LUKE,Let's go.,3
LORELAI,"Hello, sailor, bait your hook for you?",3
LUKE,You look ridiculous.,3
LORELAI,"I look adorable. No one ever told me that if you fish, you get to buy an outfit. I'll do just about anything if I can buy an outfit.",3
LUKE,"Well, I'll just let that go by because we have a lot to do here.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, wait. I'll just get my purse before we go.",3
LUKE,Go where?,3
LORELAI,To the lake.,3
LUKE,You're not ready for the lake.,3
LORELAI,Then what am I ready for?,3
LORELAI,Uh! You're putting me in the kiddie lake?,3
LUKE,Gotta crawl before you can walk.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, this is not at all embarrassing. There's not even fish in it.",3
LUKE,Trout.,3
LORELAI,"Hey! Aw, they're so cute! Hello, hi boys. And look, they're all ""ooh"" like they're singing in a little trout choir.",3
LUKE,I wouldn't get too attached.,3
LORELAI,Hi Gomer.,3
LUKE,There you go.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, don't be scared Pinky.",3
LUKE,And now there's Pinky.,3
LORELAI,"Pinky Dowdy from fourth grade. See her eyes darting back and forth, all panicked? She got that way from dodge ball. It's okay, Pinky, nobody's gonna hurt you. Hey Pete, stop crowding Pinky. It's okay, Pinky, just go over there behind Cheryl.",3
LUKE,"Okay, now that everybody knows each other, take this.",3
LORELAI,What's that?,3
LUKE,That's your rod and reel.,3
LORELAI,"Huh, rod and reel. I don't know if the guys are gonna like this.",3
LUKE,"Well, we can skip the lesson and just take the trout out for some beers. It's up to you, really.",3
LORELAI,"No, I'm going to learn.",3
LUKE,"Okay. I already went ahead and threaded your line through the guides here, and put a hook on it.",3
LORELAI,What kind of bait is that?,3
LUKE,It's a cork.,3
LORELAI,Remind me not to let you cater any of my parties.,3
LUKE,"It's to cover the hook. Okay, now, this little metal thing is the bail. It's very important. It keeps your line on the spool here.",3
LORELAI,"Line on the spool, got it.",3
LUKE,"Okay, take the rod in your right hand, and you press your right index finger on the line, holding it against the pole. With your left hand, slide the bail over. Now don't let go of your index finger or all the line will spin off your spool. Now, pull the pole back over your shoulder to the ten o'clock position.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, great, now I gotta go buy a watch.",3
LUKE,"You flip your wrist forward to two o'clock, at the same time releasing your index finger,casting your line out into the lake in front of you. Now, you try.",3
LORELAI,"Okay. Now, I do something with my right hand, my right index finger, and with the bail and a spool, and pull the thingy. . .",3
LORELAI,"Oh! Now, that would've been embarrassing if I weren't dressed like this.",3
LUKE,"Oh, you released at eleven, you're supposed to release at two o'clock. Try again.",3
LORELAI,Okay.,3
LORELAI,"Ah! Hey, I made it in the pool, I made it in the pool!",3
LUKE,I see that.,3
LORELAI,Why aren't you excited?,3
LUKE,I'm very excited.,3
LORELAI,"Well, jump around or something.",3
LUKE,"All right, you know, you're going in the pool.",3
LORELAI,Fine.,3
LUKE,"All right, what do you think? Ready to take the cork off and try your luck?",3
LORELAI,"Uh, uh, I'm ready, but they're not.",3
LUKE,No problem.,3
LORELAI,"Man, you need a lot of stuff for fishing.",3
LUKE,"Well, normally, you don't bring your own lake.",3
LORELAI,"Right, right.",3
LUKE,"So, tell me w hy you're doing this.",3
LORELAI,Because you told me to.,3
LUKE,"I mean, tell me w hy you're learning to fish.",3
LORELAI,"Oh. I told you, some of my friends are going.",3
LUKE,What friends? Sookie?,3
LORELAI,What?,3
LUKE,Is Sookie going fishing?,3
LORELAI,Well  ,3
LUKE,Or Rory   did Rory suddenly get the overwhelming urge to dig for worms and stand in the middle of a lake at five a.m.?,3
LORELAI,"Yes? Okay, fine, I met this guy.",3
LUKE,Ah.,3
LORELAI,"And, uh, he's kind of an outdoorsy guy.",3
LUKE,"Oh, just your type.",3
LORELAI,"No, not exactly, but he's nice and, uh, he was talking about fishing, and I think I said something like,  Oh, hey, that sounds great', and so he invited me and here I am.",3
LUKE,I got it.,3
LORELAI,Sorry I didn't tell you.,3
LUKE,Why didn't you tell me?,3
LORELAI,"I don't know. I just felt stupid getting rooked into the thing in the first place, and then. . .plus, you don't wanna hear about my personal life.",3
LUKE,So this'll be your first date or. . .,3
LORELAI,Second.,3
LUKE,Second date.,3
LORELAI,He took me to this coffee tasting place.,3
LUKE,"Coffee tasting, just your type.",3
LORELAI,Uh huh.,3
LUKE,"Well, I think that's great.",3
LORELAI,Thank you.,3
LUKE,Yeah. When are you going?,3
LORELAI,Sunday morning.,3
LUKE,"Oh. Well, it's hard to be a fisher woman without your own pole. You can borrow one of mine if you want.",3
LORELAI,Really?,3
LUKE,"Yeah, I got an extra little tackle box, too. . . if you want.",3
LORELAI,That would be great.,3
LUKE,Yeah.,3
LORELAI,Can you do me one more favor?,3
LUKE,Sure.,3
LORELAI,Put a cork on your hook.,3
LUKE,,3
LORELAI,Could you please just make some coffee?,3
RORY,I'm not doing anything for you ever.,3
LORELAI,Don't be mad.,3
RORY,You set my alarm for 5:15 a.m.,3
LORELAI,"I know, and I did it for purely practical reasons.",3
RORY,Which are?,3
LORELAI,My alarm is just not as reliable as your scream.,3
RORY,You will pay.,3
LORELAI,"That's fine, honey. Now, coffee?",3
RORY,"I am writing this in my ledger of all the crummy things you've done over the years, and when I leave this house, mark my words   you will pay!",3
LORELAI,"Oh great. It's 5:30 a.m., and I have no coffee in my system.",3
ALEX,Hi.,3
LORELAI,Hi.,3
ALEX,Coffee and donuts.,3
LORELAI,"Ah, I like you. Come on in. Right in here. This is Rory.",3
ALEX,"Hi, I'm Alex.",3
RORY,"Nice to meet you. Would've been nicer in the daylight, but. . .",3
LORELAI,"Okay, let's get going. It's not like the fish are gonna wait for us all day, right? I'll take that coffee now. Thank you. I got it, I got it.",3
ALEX,"Your mom's never been fishing before, has she?",3
RORY,"Oh, no, she's a well-seasoned fish k*ller.",3
ALEX,Uh huh. I made lunch reservations at the Shahaela Lodge and Spa afterward. Think she'll like that?,3
RORY,She'll love that.,3
ALEX,,3
KIM,"Min Jae, you lost weight. Look good, not so fat. MIN",3

DAVE,"Hi, and hi.",3
LANE,"Uh, this will not be the mental image you carry around of me the rest of the week.",3
DAVE,,3
KIM,Why aren't you upstairs? It's not right to leave the bride alone on her wedding day.,3
LANE,,3
KIM,"David, hello.",3
DAVE,,3
KIM,"Thank you. Come, sit here. This is Ho Kyung, she'll sing with you.",3
DAVE,,3
KIM,,3
LANE,How's it going?,3
RORY,"I like it, but I'm not the one getting married. Um, your hair, do you like it?",3
LANE,Too much for me.,3
RORY,"Oh, I found the Mrs. Kim-approved makeup in the drawer, but let me tell you, since the last wedding, it has developed a smell.",3
LANE,A what? Oh boy.,3
RORY,"As I said, a smell.",3
LANE,"Well, I've got the good stuff right here, right next to the Peggy Lee.",3
RORY,Seems appropriate.,3
LANE,I thought so. Shall we?,3
RORY,"Unh unh, the foot stool.",3
LANE,"Whoa. All set. So, Dave's here.",3
RORY,"He is, huh?",3
LANE,I still can't believe he's willing to do all this just to go out with me.,3
RORY,"Well, hey, where else can he find a decent, pretty, smart girl who can recite the entire encyclopedia of rock in 5/8 time?",3
LANE,"Nowhere, I guess.",3
RORY,I'm really happy for you guys.,3
LANE,"Thanks. I'm really happy for you and Jess, too.",3
RORY,"Thanks. You know it's okay, right?",3
LANE,Not following.,3
RORY,It's okay not to like Jess.,3
LANE,I said I was happy for you.,3
RORY,I know.,3
LANE,"God, I'm such a jerk.",3
RORY,"You're not. Look, we're not always going to like the same things. Like, you like Smashing Pumpkins and I don't.",3
LANE,But that's only  cause you're close-minded and blind.,3
RORY,What can I say? They're not my angst.,3
LANE,"Besides, it's not like I don't want to like Jess. I can't help it. As your best friend, I'm very protective of you.",3
RORY,You could try giving him a second chance.,3
LANE,"I could. I should. I will. Um, hey, maybe we can all go out sometime together as a group, you know, you, me, Dave, Jess.",3
RORY,"Absolutely, we should do that sometime.",3
LANE,,3
KIM,What's going on in here?,3
LANE,"Nothing, Mama.",3
RORY,I fell off my chair.,3
LANE,"Oh, well, don't.",3
RORY,,3
KIM,She looks very beautiful. Must've gotten a good night sleep.,3
RORY,How many people do you think have gotten married here over the years?,3
LANE,I counted once off the guest book   forty-six.,3
RORY,"Wow. What happened to that one, Min Cha? She married a real mean guy.",3
LANE,Wan Nam. Didn't I tell you about them?,3
RORY,No.,3
LANE,"Well, Min Cha put up with seven years of Wan Nam telling her she was stupid and ordering her to cook all his meals. Then one day, he was in the kitchen looking for his lunch and she just snapped. Took a carrot peeler and turned on him.",3
RORY,A carrot peeler?,3
LANE,"You can get those things pretty sharp. Anyway, she just came at him and started peeling. The neighbors called the police. They showed up and Wan Nam was just standing there all peeled.",3
RORY,What happened?,3
LANE,"He didn't press charges, but now he makes all his own meals, sleeps in a locked separate room, and keeps the cutting board by his bed for protection. Still married, though.",3
RORY,Wow.,3
LANE,"Everybody's still married. It's like a factory system here. They all come to the weddings, find a spouse, get married and stay that way  til they die.",3
RORY,"They mate for life, like the loons.",3
LANE,"You know, this may be the last wedding for a long time, though.",3
RORY,How come?,3
LANE,"Well, all my cousins in their twenties and thirties are married. James was the last one.",3
RORY,Wow. It feels like we've had at least two of these every year since I can remember.,3
LANE,"Elementary school, when we met.",3
RORY,"Elementary school, when we met, yeah.",3
LANE,"Well, we do have some distant relatives left. Maybe we can go to one of those weddings. You know, when we come home from college on break or something.",3
RORY,"Well, then, we should definitely keep the makeup.",3
LANE,We definitely should.,3
RORY,"And who knows, maybe the next Kim wedding we do makeup for will be yours.",3
LANE,"Too scary, don't freak me out.",3
RORY,Sorry.,3
LANE,"So, what do you think, eye shadow?",3
RORY,,3
LUKE,Here you go. We'll top that off for ya. Coffee over here.,3

NICOLE,"Yeah? Mr. Danes, how are you?",3
LUKE,"Good, good, and it's Luke.",3
NICOLE,"Okay, Luke. What can I do for you?",3
LUKE,I wouldn't cross there.,3
NICOLE,Why not?,3
LUKE,"Well, Taylor's a stickler about jaywalking and he's town magistrate. I'd hate for you to be disbarred.",3
NICOLE,"Well, that would be a bad way to end a career, thank you.",3
LUKE,"Sure. So, uh, did the lease forms all work out? I mean, was my signature okay?  Cause sometimes I'm in a kind of a hurry and my hand just takes off without me.",3
NICOLE,Your signature seemed very steady.,3
LUKE,"Good, good,  cause you never know.",3
NICOLE,Well  ,3
LUKE,"Listen, I was thinking about that cup of coffee you had at my place the other day. I felt bad making Taylor pay for it   not that I ever feel bad sticking it to Taylor. I just thought it might get you in trouble with a client. I'd hate to see you disbarred again.",3
NICOLE,"To be honest, I actually paid for the coffee myself.",3
LUKE,"Oh, oh, well, then at least let me pay you back for it.",3
NICOLE,You wanna give me seventy-five cents?,3
LUKE,"No, no, no, uh, what I meant was   ah, what the hell? Would you like to have dinner with me sometime?",3
NICOLE,Yeah.,3
LUKE,Really?,3
NICOLE,I'd love to have dinner with you.,3
LUKE,"Great. Okay, uh, well, I have your card.",3
NICOLE,Mmhmm.,3
LUKE,Why don't I give you a call this week and we'll make that happen.,3
NICOLE,Sounds good.,3
LUKE,"Yeah, sounds good. So, see ya. Watch those crosswalks.",3
NICOLE,"Thanks, I will.",3
LUKE,Shut up.,3
JESS,I said nothing.,3

PRIEST,And do you vow to uphold the principles of the seventh commandment as set out in Exodus 20:14?,3
JAMES,I do.,3
PRIEST,"And so, in the Glory of God, I pronounce you husband and wife.",3
RORY,That was nice.,3
LANE,,3
KIM,Reception at Elks Lodge. Two hundred guests. Food goes fast. Let's move.,3
RORY,I can't believe that's the last time I'll hear your mom say that.,3
LANE,"So, are you coming to the reception?",3
RORY,"Oh, no, I was actually going to  ",3
LANE,Go meet Jess.,3
RORY,Yeah. Are you mad?,3
LANE,"No. You know, he can come to the reception with you if. . . he's not really the reception kind of guy, is he?",3
RORY,"Not really. Not yet, anyway.",3
LANE,We'll work on that.,3
RORY,"Yes, we will.",3

KIM,"Get your coat, we have to go.",3
LANE,,3
KIM,No?,3
LANE,,3
KIM,Why not? I thought you wanted to go to the prom.,3
LANE,,3
KIM,I thought you say I could approve the boy you go to the prom with.,3

RORY,,3
LORELAI,"See, this is why I don't fish.",3
RORY,She is kinda cute.,3
LORELAI,And she has a great tail swish.,3
RORY,"So, other than bringing home a p et, how was fishing?",3
LORELAI,"Good. The lake was beautiful, snowy and sparkly, and right down the road from the Shahaela Lodge and Spa.",3

EMILY,"Richard, who was the one who got drunk at our Christmas party and hiked up her skirt in front of the Town and Country photographer?",3
RICHARD,"I'm sorry, did you say something?",3
LORELAI,"I don't know about you, Mom, but I've never felt so fascinating in my entire life.",3

LORELAI,Those are guidebooks.,3
EMILY,"""Europe Through the Backdoor."" ""The Rough Guide to Europe."" What kind of guidebooks are these?",3
LORELAI,The cheap kind.,3

EMILY,Backpacking and staying in hostels?,3
RICHARD,Who's backpacking and staying in hostels?,3
LORELAI,We are.,3

EMILY,That sounds wonderful. Tomorrow I'll go out and buy some cutoffs.,3
LORELAI,"Guys, we're not kidding.",3
EMILY,You're telling me you're seriously going to traipse across Europe with your possessions strapped to your back and sleep in a room with thirty other people?,3
LORELAI,Yes.,3
RICHARD,No.,3
RORY,Grandpa.,3
RICHARD,It's not safe. I forbid it. Call our travel agent.,3
RORY,"But we want to be spontaneous. Jump a train to Paris, head off to Spain.",3
LORELAI,"Oh no, it's raining in Spain. But since the rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain. . .",3
RORY,Looks like Italy for us!,3
LORELAI,Mamma mia!,3
RICHARD,You can still travel around aimlessly and stay in a decent hotel.,3
LORELAI,We wanna do it cheap.,3
EMILY,We'll pay.,3
LORELAI,No.,3
RORY,"Grandma, it's going to be fun, really.",3
LORELAI,Kids do this all the time.,3
EMILY,"Yes, but you're not a kid, you're a grown woman. What are people going to think when they see a grown woman bunking down with a bunch of twenty-year-olds?",3
LORELAI,"Well, if the twenty-year-olds are cute, they'll probably think, ""Lucky!""",3
RORY,"Grandma, don't be upset. It really is going to be great.",3
EMILY,"What's so traumatic about a night without a bed anyway? My survey shows those who have had the opportunity to be a refugee for a night have their perspectives broaden and actually enjoy the experience."" Richard, this book is encouraging them to sleep in a park like a squirrel.",3
LORELAI,"It's okay, Mom.",3
EMILY,"My first trip to Europe, I went to Paris and stayed at the Ritz.",3

JESS,So a special place.,3
LUKE,"Will you stop saying that word, please? And yes.",3
JESS,Find anything good?,3
LUKE,"Every single description in here talks about tablecloths and dish design, nothing about the food.",3
JESS,You are really going through an awful lot for this lawyer.,3
LUKE,"She's not a lawyer. I mean, yes, she's a lawyer, but she's also a lady, and a very nice lady who probably expects good food with her fancy plates and sparse yet elegant décor.",3
JESS,You're pathetic when you're in love.,3
LUKE,"I'm not in love, I'm dating. This is what you do when you're dating.",3
JESS,It's not what I do when I'm dating.,3

DEAN,Excuse me?,3
JESS,What are the extra pickles on?,3
DEAN,On the side.,3

DEAN,Just make sure there's enough for everyone.,3
JESS,Fine.,3
DEAN,Aren't you gonna read it back?,3
JESS,Nope.,3
DEAN,"Okay, but these men were hired by Taylor, which means if they aren't satisfied with their orders, they will send them back. And they will continue to send them back until they are happy, which means you could be making this order until you die.",3
JESS,"Six burgers, three with cheese   two cheddar, one Swiss.",3
DEAN,"Slower, please. I'm checking them off as we go.",3
JESS,,3

MICHELorelai,No!,3
LORELAI,We have to call the florist.,3
MICHELorelai,"But this is the fourth theme he's picked. He had the fishing one, and the Kentucky Derby with the chocolate horsies, and the Tibet with the Richard Gere pictures everywhere.",3
LORELAI,I know.,3
MICHELorelai,And he promised that the golf would be the last one.,3
LORELAI,"Well, he decided that golf was dull and he doesn't want to be remembered as dull.",3
MICHELorelai,"Would he like to be rememb ered as limping, because I can be a fabulous help with that.",3
LORELAI,"Hey, guys. . .",3

MICHELorelai,"Here's an idea   it's a retirement party, yes? Okay. So what happens after you retire? You die.",3
LORELAI,He changed his mind.,3
LANE,Again?,3
MICHELorelai,"So, why don't we dig a big hole, throw him in, hand everybody a shovel, they take turns covering him up. We go inside, have dinner, the wife gets used to eating alone. . .",3
LORELAI,We are not going to bury him alive.,3
MICHELorelai,"Well, fine then. What is the new theme?",3
LORELAI,He is calling me back at four.,3

LORELAI,"Good God, this party is gonna be the death of me.",3
MICHELorelai,Or someone.,3

LORELAI,She's more than sort of your sister.,3
RORY,I just think it would be cool to meet her the night that she's born. It's a good story to talk about.,3
LORELAI,You should go.,3
RORY,"I should, shouldn't I?",3
LORELAI,And you should take pictures and wear a hidden microphone  cause I wanna hear everything.,3

LORELAI,Just hold your breath this one actually takes.,3
RORY,And how is Sookie supposed to plan a Beanie Baby menu?,3
LORELAI,Lots of beans.,3
RORY,I think this is ridiculous.,3
LORELAI,"Angel face, you need to learn that there are going to be times in your life when you have to do ridiculous things for money. If you're Adrian Zmed, that includes everything that ever happens in your whole career. Oh Rory, come on. Did you order from Amazon again? 'Cause we're going to get your books their own house.",3
RORY,"I didn't, I swear.",3
LORELAI,It's from my mother.,3
RORY,What is it?,3
LORELAI,It's heavy. Must be her hopes and dreams for me.,3
RORY,I thought she discarded those years ago.,3
LORELAI,"Just drop the Beanies by the door. ""Girls, here are some travel books I stumbled across in your father's study. I thought they could help in the planning of your European adventure."" She's insane.",3
RORY,We have travel books.,3

RORY,This hotel is five hundred dollars a night.,3
LORELAI,Five hundred dollars a night twenty years ago.,3
RORY,What could a hotel possibly have that would make it five hundred dollars a night?,3

CHRISTOPHERory,"I'm taking a year and I'm going to Europe. I'm gonna backpack, train it, sleep on a bench, see the world.",3
LORELAI,"And you've told Straub and Francine about your big plans, I'm sure.",3

CHRISTOPHERory,"Fine, you we get a room for, and then I'll just sleep on the bench outside.",3
LORELAI,Much better arrangement.,3
CHRISTOPHERory,So you'll go?,3
LORELAI,"Christopher, you're supposed to go to college. I'm supposed to go to college. Then you're supposed to join your dad's firm where you'll get a corner office and big stick to shove up your butt.",3
CHRISTOPHERory,Change of plans.,3
LORELAI,You can't just change the plans. The plans came over on the Mayflower.,3
CHRISTOPHERory,"Come on, Lor. Let's get out of here, let's get away from this place. Let's take Myra and just bolt. Leave a note on the dining room table. ""Dear Richard and Emily, I don't belong here, I'm going somewhere else, I'll call you when I get there. Love, Lorelai.' How does that sound?",3
LORELAI,"Well, the word ""whoopee"" comes to mind.",3
CHRISTOPHERory,"So, then, it's a plan.",3
LORELAI,,3
RORY,"Hey, I want to sleep amongst thirteenth century tapestries and chocolates made by local artisans.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, then, it's settled. We're not staying at any place that wasn't built for Napoleon the third's doctor or doesn't have a Chagall in the bathroom.",3

MADELINE,I agree.,3
LOUISE,"It wasn't healthy, all that non-dating.",3
MADELINE,It definitely didn't help that whole skin thing she was going through.,3
LOUISE,How come she didn't tell us?,3
MADELINE,I think she just wanted to make sure it was gonna take.,3
LOUISE,"So, tell us, what's this Jamie like?",3

RORY,"Um, Paris.",3
PARIS,Yes?,3
RORY,I'm sneezing.,3
PARIS,What?,3
RORY,In the picture. I'm sneezing and my head is turned.,3
PARIS,"Oh, yeah, I noticed that, but every picture had something wrong with it and I had to pick the one that was the best for the largest number of people.",3
RORY,We took ninety pictures.,3
PARIS,What's your point?,3
RORY,"My point is in ninety tries, there wasn't one other picture that was good for the group and didn't have me looking like I'm in Cirque du Soleil.",3
PARIS,Sorry. Life can play some cruel tricks sometimes.,3
RORY,Life had a little help from the Gellar camp this time. We are not done. Hello?,3

ARLETTA,"Yes, ma'am. Twenty minutes ago.",3
EMILY,And what did she say?,3
ARLETTA,She said she was still getting dressed. Do you want me to go up there again?,3
EMILY,"No, I'll do it. I swear, you'd think that it was my coming out portrait, not hers, for the amount of concern she has about all of this. I'll be right back. Don't scratch the floor.",3

EMILY,"Turn around, I'll do it. Oh my God.",3
LORELAI,What?,3
EMILY,"It's not the zipper, it's the dress. It's too small.",3
LORELAI,Are you sure?,3
EMILY,Of course I'm sure. It's too small. How can it be too small? We had a fitting three months ago. Have you gained weight?,3
LORELAI,No.,3
EMILY,Hold your breath.,3
LORELAI,I am.,3
EMILY,Hold your breath!,3
LORELAI,I am!,3

RORY,Where's everyone else?,3
MAUREEN,"Oh, they're working.",3
RORY,What?,3
MAUREEN,"Well, we had all planned on next week, but Sherry screwed up, so what can you do? Thank God you're here. She'll be thrilled. She's feeling a little abandoned. Now, she's right in there. Do not mention how fat she is. For some reason, she's extremely sensitive about that today. Okay, kiss. I'll call you later to find out how everything's going.",3
RORY,"Wait, where are you going?",3
MAUREEN,I've gotta get back to work. I'm swamped today.,3

RORY,How are you?,3
SHERRY,This wasn't supposed to happen now.,3
RORY,I know.,3
SHERRY,Christopher's out of town. I think Maureen called him and left a message but it doesn't matter because he's not here. Where's Maureen?,3
RORY,"Oh, well, she had to go back to work, but she said she'd call later.",3
SHERRY,She's at work?,3
RORY,Yes.,3
SHERRY,I'm lying in a bed. God knows what's gonna happen.,3
RORY,"Well, you're going to have a baby.",3
SHERRY,"And she goes back to work. I would love to go back to work, but I can't because I have tostay here.",3
RORY,"Well, yeah, because you're going to have a baby.",3
SHERRY,"She's not here. None of my friends are here. Christopher isn't here. No one is here. No one but you. Thank God you're here, Rory. I don't think that I could do this by myself because this wasn't supposed to happen until next week. I wrote it down. I wrote it down. I wrote it down!",3
RORY,,3
EMILY,"Well, it's a rare treat to have an evening alone with my daughter uncoerced.",3
LORELAI,"Yes, it is, isn't it?",3
EMILY,So Rory's at the hospital?,3
LORELAI,"Uh, yeah. She's gonna see her new half-sister fresh from the oven.",3
EMILY,"Well, that's about an unpleasant a description as I've ever heard. I thought we'd have martinis.",3
LORELAI,Very good thought.,3
EMILY,Olives?,3
LORELAI,Twist.,3
EMILY,So how's Rory feeling about Christopher's new baby?,3
LORELAI,She's very excited. It's kind of cute.,3
EMILY,You should've gotten her a puppy.,3
LORELAI,Stop. No maid tonight?,3
EMILY,"Leloni usually takes Sundays off, but she wanted to switch and seeing as it's just you and I, I said yes.",3
LORELAI,"Leloni, huh? Very exotic name.",3
EMILY,She's from Honolulu.,3
LORELAI,Cool. Does she know Don Ho?,3
EMILY,No.,3
LORELAI,Charo?,3
EMILY,No.,3
LORELAI,The C&H Pure Cane Sugar dancers?,3
EMILY,"Lorelai, please, we don't have a buffer here tonight.",3
LORELAI,"So who cooked dinner? Ugh, please don't tell me it's you  cause we can always. . .diet.",3
EMILY,Leloni made a roast before she left and I heated it up.,3
LORELAI,You did?,3
EMILY,I even added a little wine to the pan to keep it from drying out.,3
LORELAI,"Well, who died and made you Sara Moulton?",3
EMILY,Drink this and be quiet.,3
LORELAI,"So, um, how long is Dad gone for this time?",3
EMILY,Two weeks.,3
LORELAI,Didn't he just come home last week?,3
EMILY,"Yes, he did.",3
LORELAI,So business must be pretty good?,3
EMILY,"I suppose. He has to work twice as hard as he ever did, and I'm still not sure that he's actually made a dime yet. However, he does see to be having the time of his life, so what can you do?",3
LORELAI,"Nothing, I guess. Hey Mom, can I ask you something?",3
EMILY,Of course you can.,3
LORELAI,What do you do while Dad is gone?,3
EMILY,"Well, I do all sorts of things.",3
LORELAI,Like what?,3
EMILY,"Well, I keep this house running.",3
LORELAI,Uh huh.,3
EMILY,And I have my DAR meet ings and there's always a thousand calls to make. I have functions and fundraising events to organize. A million different things.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, but what do you do at night?",3
EMILY,Excuse me?,3
LORELAI,"I mean, you don't organize functions at night, do you?",3
EMILY,What are you insinuating?,3
LORELAI,"I'm not insinuating anything, Mom. I'm just trying to find out a little bit about your life.",3
EMILY,"Well, your father calls every night at nine o'clock and we talk.",3
LORELAI,"So, you spend fifteen minutes talking to Dad and then you hang up the phone and you   what? Watch television?",3
EMILY,I don't watch that much television. I don't find forensic work quite as fascinating as the rest of the world.,3
LORELAI,"But you have cable, right? I mean, you could watch movies.",3
EMILY,"Yes, but I never know where the maid puts that guide they send you, so I always wind up turning it on after a movie has already started and I don't like to come in on the middle of things.",3
LORELAI,"But you could tape the movies, or get a DVD player.",3
EMILY,I don't need a DVD player.,3
LORELAI,"Well, why not? Then you could buy all those musicals you love and watch them whenever you felt like it.",3
EMILY,"I'm not an invalid, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,"Well, of course you are, Mother. Why else would I suggest a DVD player?",3
EMILY,I can fill my time al l by myself and I'd like you to drop this conversation right now.,3
LORELAI,Where are you going?,3
EMILY,We're going to eat.,3
LORELAI,"Just because you leave the room doesn't mean the conversation's over. I started the conversation. The conversation's in me. Therefore, when I get over there, the conversation's just gonna start up again. FLASHBACK   ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE",3
STRAUB,This is unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable.,3
FRANCINE,I feel sick.,3
STRAUB,Everything's gone. It's been tossed right out the window. Stop crying.,3
EMILY,"Here Francine, drink your water. We all need to calm down. Getting upset isn't going to get us anywhere.",3
FRANCINE,What do we tell people?,3
EMILY,"Well, who needs to know?",3
STRAUB,"What do you mean, who needs to know?",3
EMILY,"You don't have to yell at me, Straub.",3
STRAUB,"Everybody has to know, Emily. Everybody will know. We can't pretend this didn't happen.",3
FRANCINE,You could send her away.,3
EMILY,Excuse me?,3
FRANCINE,Aren't there places that take girls like that?,3
EMILY,"Girls like what, Francine?",3
FRANCINE,"Well, girls in. . .I can't handle this, I can't handle this at all.",3
STRAUB,"Stop crying, dammit .",3
EMILY,Christopher is just as much to blame as Lorelai is.,3
STRAUB,Like hell he is.,3
EMILY,They are in this together.,3
STRAUB,I don't see why. Why should Christopher sacrifice everything we've planned for him just because  ,3
EMILY,"Choose your words extremely carefully, Straub.",3
FRANCINE,"Emily, you know we love Lorelai, you know that. But Christopher's so young, he's a baby.",3
EMILY,"Well, Lorelai's not exactly collecting social security.",3
STRAUB,Why doesn't she get rid of it?,3
EMILY,What?,3
FRANCINE,Straub.,3
STRAUB,It's an option.,3
EMILY,It certainly is not an option.,3
STRAUB,Why not?,3
EMILY,Because I say so.,3
STRAUB,"Then what the hell are you suggesting, Emily? What's your great solution to this problem?",3
RICHARD,"They will get married, they will live here, and Christopher will go to work at my company. That is the solution. Now, we have a plan so we can all stop talking about it. Please excuse me, I have work to do.",3
EMILY,I think Richard's plan sounds very sensible.,3
STRAUB,I just have one question   why his company?,3
EMILY,"What do you mean, his company?",3
STRAUB,"Well, I have a law firm. Christopher could go to school.",3
LORELAI,"I know we're all upset here folks, but maybe we should ask the kids what they think. Lorelai, Christopher, anything to add here?",3
CHRISTOPHERory,"Quiet, they'll hear you.",3
LORELAI,Not likely. I don't know how much longer I can just sit here like this.,3
CHRISTOPHERory,"It's okay, let them talk.",3
LORELAI,They're talking about us.,3
CHRISTOPHERory,They're trying to figure out what to do.,3

CHRISTOPHERory,How?,3
LORELAI,We'll figure it out.,3
CHRISTOPHERory,It's okay. It sounds okay.,3
LORELAI,What sounds okay?,3
CHRISTOPHERory,"You know, working for your dad, living here. It sounds okay.",3
LORELAI,"Chris, no! What about Europe? What about sleeping on a bench in Paris?",3
CHRISTOPHERory,We can't do that now. I have to get a job.,3
LORELAI,No!,3
CHRISTOPHERory,I have to make money.,3
LORELAI,No!,3
CHRISTOPHERory,"It's okay, really.",3

RORY,Xeroxing.,3
LORELAI,What?,3

LORELAI,"Okay, as long as you have a sane reason from a reliable source.",3
SHERRY,I'm scared.,3
LORELAI,"I know. It's scary, and it hurts like hell. And remember, when it comes out not to look at it too hard until they give it a good cleaning, or you'll think you gave birth to phlegm. But, um, once they give it a good scrub, it's just unbelievably cool.",3
SHERRY,Yeah?,3
LORELAI,"Well, and look how good they grow up. Not bad, huh?",3

SHERRY,I'm glad you're here.,3
LORELAI,,3
LORELAI,She's jogging in place.,3
RORY,Why?,3
LORELAI,I think she's hoping to aerobicize the thing right out of there.,3
RORY,"Well, should we stop her?",3
LORELAI,I tried. She almost took an eye out.,3
RORY,"Well, that can't be good for the baby.",3
LORELAI,"Well, it's probably no worse than the guilt trip it's gonna get for showing up a week early.",3
RORY,You do know it's a girl.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, I should probably stop calling it ""it"". Her ""it"".",3
RORY,I was just bringing you some coffee.,3
LORELAI,Thanks. Did you try calling your dad again?,3
RORY,His cell's not in service or out of range or something.,3
LORELAI,"You do know if he doesn't get here, I have to go in with her.",3
RORY,"Yes, I do.",3
LORELAI,"Well, I don't want to go in with her.",3
RORY,At least you know what's gonna happen.,3
LORELAI,I had the cheap seat before. My view was quite a bit different.,3
RORY,"Hey, should we buy a camera or something?",3
LORELAI,For what?,3
RORY,"If Dad doesn't get here, shouldn't we maybe  ",3
LORELAI,No.,3
RORY,But  ,3

CHRISTOPHERory,Has it happened? Did I miss it?,3
RORY,No.,3
LORELAI,You have perfect timing.,3
CHRISTOPHERory,I must've broken fifteen different laws getting here. I don't even remember where I left my car. I thought I wasn't gonna make it.,3
LORELAI,"Well, take a breath, you did make it, and Sherry's gonna be thrilled.",3
CHRISTOPHERory,Where is she?,3
LORELAI,Come on.,3
CHRISTOPHERory,Is this. . .,3
LORELAI,Yeah.,3
CHRISTOPHERory,Sherry!,3
SHERRY,"Christopher, you're here! I can't believe you're here. I didn't think you'd make it.",3
CHRISTOPHERory,Are you kidding? You think I'd miss this.,3
SHERRY,"No, I'm sorry. It's just, I'm just in a lot of pain and I can't think straight.",3
NURSE,I take it this is your fiancé.,3
SHERRY,"Yeah, this is him. This is my Christopher.",3
NURSE,"Well, Christopher, are you coming in with us?",3
CHRISTOPHERory,Try and stop me.,3

LORELAI,Well. . . FLASHBACK   HOSPITAL,3
LORELAI,"Okay, this is a big pain and I'd really like it to go away, please.",3
NURSE,"Just breathe deep, honey.",3
LORELAI,"Breathing doesn't help, can I hit you instead?",3
NURSE,What?,3
LORELAI,"Or pinch you really hard,  cause that might make me feel better.",3
NURSE,"No, you cannot hit me.",3
LORELAI,Can I bite you or pull your hair or use the Epilady on you  cause I really need to do something.,3
EMILY,Lorelai Gilmore!,3
LORELAI,"Wheel this a little faster, please.",3
EMILY,"Lorelai, you do not do this. You do not just leave a person a note.",3

RICHARD,"Emily, please, I feel ridiculous.",3
EMILY,"You're having a baby   do you know that, Lorelai?",3
LORELAI,"Well, that explains the stomachache.",3
EMILY,"You do not leave your house when you are having a baby without telling your mother. You say, ""Excuse me, Mom. I'm having a baby, give me a ride to the damn hospital!""",3
RICHARD,"Emily, please, I wore the wrong shoes for this.",3
EMILY,"Of all the things in the world I had a right to do, driving my daughter to the hospital to give birth, especially since she's sixteen years old and doesn't have her driver's license yet, is definitely one of them.",3
NURSE,"Ma'am, I need to wait out here, please.",3
EMILY,Why?,3
NURSE,Because we're going into the delivery room.,3
EMILY,I want to go in.,3
LORELAI,"No, Mom, please.",3
RICHARD,"Yes, Emily, please.",3

NICOLE,I would love some coffee.,3
LUKE,"Have a seat. Jess, coffee over here.",3
NICOLE,"So, I have to say, I really hated that restaurant.",3
LUKE,"Good, I like that we're on the same page here.",3

CHRISTOPHERory,"Oh, man, Lor, in my wildest dreams, I never could've imagined. I've never been that nervous or terrified or nauseous in my entire life. It was like the most amazing thing ever in the world. It was like. . .well, you know.",3

CHRISTOPHERory,There.,3
LORELAI,Wow.,3
CHRISTOPHERory,That's my daughter.,3
LORELAI,I can tell.,3
CHRISTOPHERory,How?,3
LORELAI,I think she conned that one out of his blanket.,3
CHRISTOPHERory,She's perfect.,3

LORELAI,"Hi, Mom.",3
EMILY,What on Earth are you doing here? What is this?,3
LORELAI,This is your new DVD player.,3
EMILY,My what?,3
LORELAI,"Plus, I picked up Singin' in the Rain, Funny Girl, Easter Parade, An American in Paris, and as an added bonus, the new classic dance series   Urban Cowboy, Saturday Night Fever, Grease, Footloose, and Flashdance. Trust me, you're gonna be cutting up your sweatshirts all weekend.",3
EMILY,Why did you do this?,3
LORELAI, Cause I thought you'd enjoy it.,3
EMILY,But I don't know anything about a DVD player.,3
LORELAI,"Mom, trust me, once it's hooked up, all you'll have to know is how to press play.",3
EMILY,But who's gonna hook it up?,3
LORELAI,I am.,3
EMILY,You know how to hook this up?,3
LORELAI,I know how to read an instruction manual.,3
EMILY,Since when?,3
LORELAI,"Hm, please.",3
EMILY,Maybe we should get a professional.,3
LORELAI,I can do this. Just give me five seconds here.,3
EMILY,"Well? Well, can you do it? Oh, just forget it.",3
LORELAI,"Mom, please, just let me focus on this for one more second, and if I cannot do it, I'll get a professional DVD guy in here to install it, okay?",3
EMILY,I still don't understand why you got me this. I love this movie. FLASHBACK   ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE,3
EMILY,"Lorelai, we're leaving! Well, what do you know? She finally put Rory's stroller away. It's thefirst time in a year I haven't tripped over that thing.",3
RICHARD,Where's my scarf?,3
EMILY,"I told Tina to put everything out for you, Richard.",3
RICHARD,Out where?,3
EMILY,Look on the table.,3
RICHARD,"You have to be more specific with her, Emily.",3
EMILY,"Fine, Richard.",3
RICHARD,There should be a designated place to put things.,3
EMILY,"Whatever you say, Richard. Lorelai, we are leaving! Please acknowledge that! Where is that girl?",3
RICHARD,This is not the scarf I asked for.,3
EMILY,"Well, it looks fine. Can you just wear it?",3
RICHARD,"No, I'm gonna go back upstairs and get the scarf I intended to wear in the first place. Well, I'm surprised at you Emily. These are your friends we're seeing tonight. You would have thought that my appearance would be a priority for you. I didn't want to go to this thing in the first place. I have an early meet ing in the morning, and I would much rather go to bed and ignore the fact that the symphony has to reupholster its mezzanine this year.",3
RICHARD,,3
LORELAI,Okay.,3
EMILY,"Well, can you do it?",3
LORELAI,I have no idea.,3
EMILY,Where are you going? Are you going to take it back?,3
LORELAI,I'm going upstairs.,3
EMILY,Why?,3
LORELAI,I think I should put this in your bedroom. That's your best TV.,3

EMILY,"And then she just brushed me off with a wave of her regal hand. Not even a word, just a. . .like I'm her cabana boy. Next thing you know, instead of just walking out of the room, she'll make me bow and back out. Imperious attitude, she never gives it a rest. I schlepped her to the doctor the other day   by comman d, not request   and the elevator operator there greeted us nice and friendly. Her doctor's on the second floor and by the time we got there, that operator was in tears.",3
LORELAI,Whew.,3
EMILY,What?,3
LORELAI,"Well, Mom, you just did twenty straight minutes on Gran.",3
EMILY,It wasn't twenty minutes.,3
RORY,It was getting there.,3
LORELAI,How about a moratorium on the Gran stories for a bit?,3
EMILY,Fine. I'd rather not spoil the meal with talk of her.,3
LORELAI,Good.,3
EMILY,I should just wash my hands.,3
LORELAI,Okay.,3
RORY,We'll wait.,3
EMILY,I mean of her.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, good, wash those hands.",3
EMILY,She sucks her olive pits.,3
Posted,02/22/03 22:58,3
LORELAI,Short moratorium.,3
EMILY,Trying to extract every last ounce of flavor out of them like she does people.,3
LORELAI,She sucks flavor out of people?,3
RORY,Can we change the subject?,3
EMILY,"Life, not flavor.",3
LORELAI,"Hey, you know what Gran needs?",3
EMILY,What?,3
LORELAI,A fella.,3
RORY,With or without an umbrella.,3
EMILY,He'd have to look like an olive pit to get her attention.,3
LORELAI,It's like a Dean Martin Roast.,3
RORY,Those are never funny to me.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, they're mean.",3
RORY,Except for Don Rickles.,3
LORELAI,Totally except for Rickles.,3
EMILY,"I think she did have a man for a time squiring her around to her biddy affairs. Richard thought so, too, and it horrified him.",3
LORELAI,"Didn't want a new Daddy, huh?",3
EMILY,And then he seemed suddenly out of the picture.,3
RORY,So Great Grandma never talked about him?,3
EMILY,Never. Even though I could tell practically the day she stopped seeing him. Those kinds of things are always obvious.,3
RORY,"Yeah, I guess.",3
EMILY,When a couple is in a relationship and then suddenly isn't.,3
RORY,Right.,3
LORELAI,Right.,3
RORY,Is she still looking?,3
LORELAI,Yup.,3
RORY,"Right. Um, you know, Grandma, did I mention that unfortunately I'm not with Dean anymore?",3
EMILY,"No, you didn't.",3
RORY,"Well, I'm not.",3
EMILY,"Well, yes, I've known for weeks actually. But it's good that you confirmed it.",3
RORY,How did you know?,3
EMILY,"Well, you very abruptly stopped mentioning him eleven dinners ago, so I figured that was the case.",3
LORELAI,"Eleven dinners, you kept count?",3
EMILY,Eleven.,3
LORELAI,Eleven.,3
RORY,"Well, I'm sorry I didn't tell you Grandma.",3
EMILY,"Well, I think you should have. I mean, what if I had invited Dean to an event and you were no longer with him, and that's how I found out? It would've been embarrassing.",3
LORELAI,What sort of event would you have invited Dean to?,3
EMILY,"I don't know, a wedding.",3
LORELAI,For who?,3
EMILY,A mutual friend or something.,3
LORELAI,"You and Dean have mutual friends in common that Rory and I don't? Who would that be, the Talbotts or that senior partner at Deloite and Touche?",3
EMILY,You know what I meant. It's always best to tell each other major life events so that there's no awkwardness.,3
RORY,"Well, then, Grandma, I probably also failed to mention that I'm seeing someone else.",3
EMILY,Who?,3
RORY,Jess.,3
EMILY,Jess?,3
LORELAI,Luke's nephew. Luke from the diner.,3
EMILY,"Oh, I see. Well, am I going to get to meet him soon?",3
RORY,"Oh, I don't know.",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, Mom, that might be hard to arrange.",3
EMILY,"Well, how hard can it be? Just bring him over for dinner sometime. How about next Friday?",3
RORY,"Oh, I don't know.",3
LORELAI,"Uh, yeah, Mom, that might be hard to arrange.",3
EMILY,It's perfect timing. Richard will still be out of town and it would be nice to round off the group with a fourth.,3
LORELAI,"He works Fridays, doesn't he?",3
RORY,"Yeah, that's his usual night. Friday night. It's a bad night.",3
EMILY,"Oh, okay. Well, I suppose I'll eventually meet him someday at some function.",3
LORELAI,Perhaps a wedding.,3
EMILY,"Or Rory's graduation. That's good. That way we'll all get to meet him at once. Myself, Richard, Gran. Maybe I'll bring a couple of girls from the DAR. Reverend Mahoney might like to come al so.",3
RORY,"You know what, Grandma, now that I think about it, I think Jess does have next Friday night off.",3
EMILY,Really?,3
RORY,Let's make it a foursome.,3
EMILY,That'll be nice.,3
RORY,"Yeah, it will be nice, right Grandma?",3
EMILY,Very nice. We'll have lamb.,3
RORY,"So, it will be nice for everybody? Everybody will be nice to everybody? The key word being nice.",3
EMILY,"Yes, very nice.",3
RORY,"Really, really nice?",3
EMILY,Of course it'll be nice. That's what I just said.,3
RORY,Good. Nice would be nice.,3
EMILY,And a nice night it'll be.,3
LORELAI,,3
LORELAI,"Okay, Saturday morning I've got hair appointment, nails, and Jim.",3
RORY,You don't go to the gym.,3
LORELAI,"No, Jim is coming here to fix the garbage disposal.",3
RORY,"Jim Dunning, got it.",3
LORELAI,I also have resha plebisham.,3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,"I don't know, I can't read it.",3
RORY,"Shouldn't you change your system, go electronic or something? You're a busy woman.",3
LORELAI,"Uh, hey, my system works.",3
RORY,"Yeah, tell that to the guy who calls tomorrow because you missed your resha plebisham appointment.",3
LORELAI,I hate that we have to coordinate schedules. You're my daughter.,3
RORY,"But if we don't, we may never see each other.",3
LORELAI,We didn't use to have to do this.,3
RORY,"Well, we're busier now.",3
LORELAI,Let's just run away together and leave all this behind.,3
RORY,You mean our house?,3
LORELAI,"No, we'll take the house, we'll leave everything else.",3
RORY,Put it on your list.,3
LORELAI,So what's your day like tomorrow?,3
RORY,"Hanging out with Jess for most of the day, studying at night.",3
LORELAI,Cool. Alex and I are having dinner tomorrow night.,3
RORY,Good. That'll make it nice and quiet for when I study.,3
LORELAI,I'm that loud?,3
RORY,You are when you dance around singing  Rory's Studying' songs.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, what's this I have down for Sunday   slatha bang trafficking?",3
RORY,Lane's band practicing.,3
LORELAI,And underneath it   net fracks?,3
RORY,Get snacks.,3
LORELAI,"Right   for the band. See, see, it works. So, uh, you're actually bringing Jess to dinner on Friday?",3
RORY,It's as good a time as any. There'll only be one grandparent to contend with.,3
LORELAI,"Man, that was some stealthy little maneuver she pulled there, huh? Applying the guilt over not knowing about the Dean breakup and making you all weak, and then using that to get Jess to come to dinner on Friday. She's like Lyndon Johnson with the Senate, effortless.",3
RORY,"So, Sunday's for us, right?",3
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I have you down right here   Cokie.",3
RORY,"Good. Hey, it's still early. Do you wanna watch more of the extra supplementary stuff on the Lord of the Rings DVD?",3
LORELAI,"Well, it's just the drawings and that fat guy talking.",3
RORY,"Well, let's watch Footloose again.",3
LORELAI,Yeah.,3
RORY,"Hey, you dropped some of your notes.",3
LORELAI,,3
RORY,Do you love it?,3
JESS,It's great.,3
RORY,"The Holy Barbarians. I mean, what a title. And it's by a Venice Beach beatnik about Venice Beach beatniks, and to top it off, the beatnik who wrote it is the father of the guy that does those Actor's Studio interviews on TV.",3
JESS,The guy with the beard?,3
RORY,"Yeah, the pointy beard. That's his dad writing at his desk.",3
JESS,"Oh, it's weird that a weird beatnik-y guy would have a conservative son like that.",3
RORY,"Maybe he's not that conservative. Maybe at night, he, like, takes off his clothes and parties.",3
JESS,"Aw, man, now get that picture out of my head.",3
RORY,"It's a cool book, you've gotta admit.",3
JESS,It is. Thanks.,3
RORY,"Oh, I'm not lending it. I'm not done.",3
JESS,"Well, why'd you show it to me?",3
RORY,I like showing you the stuff I'm reading.,3
JESS,But you knew I'd wanna read it. You're a book tease.,3
RORY,You'll get it when I'm done.,3
JESS,Cruel woman.,3
RORY,"So, are you going to work now?",3
JESS,Back to the salt mines.,3
RORY,"So, you're not tied to the hours you have, right? You can trade if you want to.",3
JESS,There's some flexibility.,3
RORY,You got any flexibility next Friday night?,3
JESS,"Yeah, why?",3
RORY,I thought maybe you could come to dinner with us.,3
JESS,Us?,3
RORY,To my Grandma's.,3
JESS,To meet your grandmother.,3
RORY,"Yeah, she'll be there, so yeah, it might be rude not to introduce the two of you.",3
JESS,"I can't, I gotta work.",3
RORY,You just said you could get out.,3
JESS,I didn't know what for.,3
RORY,Jess.,3
JESS,No.,3
RORY,But I already kind of agreed.,3
JESS,"Aw, man.",3
RORY,So I'm kinda jammed here.,3
JESS,Does she know what I look like?,3
RORY,I don't think so.,3
JESS,Perfect. Find someone who vaguely resembles me. Take him. Just don't kiss him goodnight.,3
RORY,That's not going to work.,3
JESS,Andy Warhol did it all the time. We're just five bucks away from a deal.,3
RORY,That's worth five at least.,3
JESS,You Gilmores think a lot of yourselves. Okay.,3
RORY,"Thank you, thank you, thank you.",3
JESS,,3
PATTY,"Rory, get in here.",3
RORY,,3
PATTY,Get in here now. No questions.,3
RORY,,3
PATTY,"Okay, now, for those who just arrived, I'm trying out some material for my one-woman show and I need some feedback. You are my randomly picked audience.",3
DEAN,,3
PATTY,"It's part stories, part songs. Kind of like what Elaine Stritch did on Broadway, but without the bitterness. My working title   ""Buckle Up, I'm Patty.""",3
RORY,How long have you been here?,3
DEAN,An hour.,3
RORY,Poor thing.,3
DEAN,"It's been mostly her and Kirk arguing about stuff. Apparently, he's the director.",3
KIRK,,3
PATTY,"That's what I'm looking for, Kirk.",3
DEAN,Sorry I didn't save you. I didn't see you until it was too late.,3
RORY,,3
PATTY,"Okay, here we go. Hey, did you know that I once met the great Bette Davis? I was a chorus girl in a bus-and-truck tour of ""Guys and Dolls."" Beantown, I love that town. And there I was, me an d the girls backstage after the show, and in she comes. And who does she walk right up to, but little old me. And she sized me up, exhaled some smoke from that regal mouth of hers, and said, ""Doll, you don't got the high notes but you sure got the gams."" I'll always treasure that moment with Bette and I wanna dedicate this song to her. Uh, Ethel, key a D.",3
KIRK,,3
PATTY,What?,3
KIRK,,3
PATTY,"Kirk, it's my reminiscence. I can't rewrite it.",3
KIRK,,3
PATTY,Why would she say that?,3
KIRK,,3
PATTY,"I'm not rewriting my memo ries, Kirk.",3
KIRK,,3
PATTY,"Well, I think that we should discuss this later, now go back to your light booth.",3
KIRK,,3
PATTY,"It's a quarter of three, there is no one in the place, except you and me. Kirk, would you fix this?",3
KIRK,,3
PATTY,This flashing.,3
KIRK,,3
PATTY,It's disco.,3
KIRK,,3
PATTY,"Well, don't. Just give me a simple spot.",3
KIRK,"Something more obvious, got it.",3
RORY,This is a hit.,3
DEAN,It'll run for years.,3
KIRK,,3
PATTY,,3
RORY,It was nice of you to step in like that.,3
DEAN,"Well, she could've hurt herself trying to throw the podium at him like that.",3
RORY,"I think ""work in progress"" is the key phrase.",3
DEAN,I like that she tries.,3
RORY,"The woman taught me ev erything I've already forgotten about dancing, baton twirling and gymnastics.",3
DEAN,"Well, I'm this way.",3
RORY,I'm this way.,3
DEAN,See you later.,3
RORY,See ya.,3
DEAN,"You know, I kind of liked the body in the trunk thing.",3
RORY,"Me, too. Peppier.",3
DEAN,Night.,3
RORY,,3
RORY,"Oh, sorry.",3
LORELAI,It's okay.,3
ALEX,It's okay.,3
RORY,I can just shut the door so you can carry on.,3
ALEX,"No, we've carried on enough.",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, I think we've carried on pretty good out here. I'll call you about the weekend.",3
ALEX,Okay.,3
LORELAI,Bye.,3
ALEX,Bye. Bye Rory.,3
RORY,Goodnight.,3
RORY,We need a signal.,3
LORELAI,A kissing signal?,3
RORY,Something to avoid this.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, um, how  bout I sh**t off a flare when I'm outside necking with a boy?",3
RORY,You know what I mean.,3
LORELAI,"Or I could bang on the door and yell, ""Hey, we're necking out here!""",3
RORY,I still say we need a signal.,3
LORELAI,"We'll think of something. Hey, listen. Alex and I were talking about going to New York next weekend.",3
RORY,Fun.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah. He's got four tickets to a show and he's heard me talk about Sookie and Jackson so much that he wants to invite them, too.",3
RORY,"It's not ""Buckle Up, I'm Patty,"" is it?",3
LORELAI,Huh?,3
RORY,Nothing.,3
LORELAI,We'd have to leave Friday day.,3
RORY,So?,3
LORELAI,Meaning it's just you and Jess alone at dinner with the glorious Emily.,3
RORY,"Oh, that's totally fine.",3
LORELAI,Are you sure?,3
RORY,"Yeah, it might even make things easier.",3
LORELAI,What does that mean?,3
RORY,"Nothing. Just, it might make it less pressure-packed.",3
LORELAI,So I'm loud when you study and make social gatherings worse?,3
RORY,"Out of the goodness of your heart, you would be trying to shield me all night, and that might makes things worse. Out of love. And I love you, I hope you know that.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, I think I get it. I have the best intentions.",3
RORY,Bingo. Hello?,3
JESS,Hey.,3
RORY,Hey. How was work?,3
JESS,"I toted the barge, lifted the bale.",3
RORY,"Well, you're a great barge toter, I can attest to that.",3
JESS,How was your day?,3
RORY,Fine. A lot of studying.,3
JESS,Oh yeah? Is that all you did?,3
RORY,"Yeah, basically.",3
JESS,Basically?,3
RORY,"Jess, what?",3
JESS,I heard that you were basically hanging out with Dean today.,3
RORY,Where did you hear that?,3
JESS,It's all over town.,3
RORY,"Well, I was with him for awhile. What do you mean, it's all over town?",3
JESS,You haven't seen the fliers?,3
RORY,I've been home al l night. What fliers?,3
JESS,"It says, ""People are already raving about Miss Patty's one woman show.""",3
RORY,And?,3
JESS,"There's some blurbs. One says, ""Rory and Dean couldn't stop talking about it.""",3
RORY,We're on a flier?,3
JESS,"You and a bunch of others. ""The mailman says, even without proper postage, this show delivers.""",3
RORY,"Well, now she's making that up  cause Ralph's not that witty.",3
JESS,Were you hanging out there with Dean?,3
RORY,"I was not hanging out with Dean. We were both hauled in there to watch her try out material and we were sitting in the same ar ea so we talked a little, and then we left at the same time. That was it. It was all by accident.",3
JESS,Yeah?,3
RORY,"This is an old subject, Jess. You know that Dean and I are friendly.",3
JESS,I know you're friendly. That doesn't mean I don't wanna punch him.,3
RORY,"This was not a plan. I was kidnapped by Miss Patty, so was he, that's it.",3
JESS,Then you two should press charges.,3
RORY,I think we should.,3
JESS,Just  ,3
RORY,What?,3
JESS,Just tell me these things first so I don't have to read about them on telephone poles.,3
RORY,"I will, I promise.",3
JESS,Okay.,3
RORY,Okay.,3
JESS,"So, how was the show?",3
RORY,It's gonna need a lot of postage.,3
JESS,"Why does it say, ""Not in any way affiliated with Kirk"" down at the bottom?",3
RORY,"Oh, they had a showbiz spat.",3
JESS,,3
LORELAI,"Help yourselves to drinks in the fridge, guys. We've got chips, pretzels, and Brian, I rememb ered your allergies and got you the melba toast.",3
BRIAN,"That's nice, thanks.",3
DAVE,We got a lot done today.,3
LANE,We've almost got a full set.,3
ZACH,But you know what we're missing? A straight-ahead love song.,3
BRIAN,"Yeah, all our songs are pretty much about property destruction and a general dislike of right-wing causes.",3
LORELAI,"Not one love song, huh?",3
DAVE,"I think we can add one or two, that are good ones.",3
LORELAI,"Boy, you'd think love songs are all you and Lane would wanna play.",3
ZACH,"Man, this crunch just now sounded like the drum-fill in Baba O'Reilly.",3
LANE,"Cool, way to go Zach.",3
DAVE,"Yeah, Zach, a musical mouth. That's awesome.",3
ZACH,But why would Dave and Lane wanna play just love songs?,3
LORELAI,"Because, I was just thinking, you know, with Dave's name   Dave   you've got the last two letters in love. V, E. And with Lane's name, you have the L. You can just dump the A and add an O and there you go.",3
ZACH,Makes sense.,3
BRIAN,Totally. We should probably start breaking stuff down. I gotta get home for dinner.,3
ZACH,"One day soon, you're not gonna go home from dinner.",3
BRIAN,"What, I'll be dead?",3
ZACH,"No, we'll be on tour.",3
BRIAN,"Right, right.",3
ZACH,"That was a negative ""right, right,"" man.",3
LORELAI,"Guys, I'm so sorry. It just slipped out.",3
LANE,That's okay.,3
DAVE,"Luckily Zach and Brian are. . .well, Zach and Brian.",3
LORELAI,How long are you gonna keep it a secret?,3
LANE,"For awhile, at least. It's easier.",3
LORELAI,"Are you sure it would be so bad if they knew? I mean, keeping this a secret seems awfully complicated.",3
LANE,"Not really, we've got a system.",3
DAVE,"Um, speaking of which, it's 3:18. We'll have the stuff packed by 3:40, what's the situation?",3
LANE,"At 3:40, my mom will be on her way to the yarn store for her bimonthly sew-a-thon with Lacey Schwartz and Bick Ho.",3
DAVE,The yarn store's on Peach.,3
LANE,Plum.,3
DAVE,That cuts us off from our usually route to the interstate.,3
LANE,"There's a back road that circles around it, but it's gonna be muddy from the rains.",3
DAVE,"How about I have the guys take the usual route, I'll go by foot on Peach, down the alley behind Al's, over the fence, and they can pick me up a half a mile down by the Shell station.",3
LANE,"Perfect. Uh, what, that's not complicated.",3
LORELAI,Sorry I doubted you.,3
LANE,,3
LORELAI,Hey.,3
LUKE,Hey. Coffee?,3
LORELAI,"Please, and hurry. I am going to Manhattan this weekend and I need to shop for somewarm clothes.",3
LUKE,You already have warm clothes.,3
LORELAI,I have nothing.,3
LUKE,We're in Connecticut. It gets freezing here same as in New York.,3
LORELAI,"No, it's not the same.",3
LUKE,Exactly the same.,3
LORELAI,"Well, I have nothing stylish enough.",3
LUKE,"That's not true, you got the black cashmere coat.",3
LORELAI,But it needs cleaning.,3
LUKE,So clean it.,3
LORELAI,"But I need some sweaters, too.",3
LUKE,"You've got the purple, you've got the powder blue, you've got three shades of red, you've got a ton of black, all of which will go with that coat. Plus, you've got a dozen scarves to mix and match with any of those tops.",3
LORELAI,Let me shop for some clothes.,3
LUKE,Okay. So what are you doing in New York?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, a bunch of us are going. It'll be dinner and a show.",3
LUKE,"Oh, what show?",3
LORELAI,"Levittown, it's a new musical.",3
LUKE,"Right, yeah. It's in previews, doesn't officially open for a couple weeks.",3
LORELAI,"Wow, so informed.",3
LUKE,Nicole likes the theater. Her firm has an office on Madison. I've met her there a couple times. Saw Hairspray last week.,3
LORELAI,I cannot picture you watching Hairspray.,3
LUKE,It was okay. I liked The Producers better.,3
LORELAI,"Well, aren't we just a Broadway baby.",3
LUKE,Gonna have any time to k*ll there?,3
LORELAI,Some.,3
LUKE,"Got a great book, it has walking tours of old historic Manhattan. You know, before Disney got a hold of it. The Soho one's pretty good.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, I love stuff like that.",3
LUKE,It's upstairs on my dresser if you wanna run up and grab it.,3
LORELAI,"Cool, thanks.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, oh!",3
RORY,Mom!,3
LORELAI,Surprise.,3
RORY,What are you doing here?,3
LORELAI,I came up for a book.,3
JESS,A book?,3
LORELAI,Yeah.,3
JESS,Got a lot of books here. Anything in particular?,3
LORELAI,It's one of Luke's.,3
JESS,"Well, if it doesn't have Encyclopedia Brown in the title, that narrows it down a lot.",3
LORELAI,"Walking tours, New York.",3
JESS,On the table.,3
LORELAI,"Good, here it is, okay, so, thanks. Sorry about this.",3
RORY,It's okay.,3
LORELAI,We should probably come up with a system or something.,3
RORY,Probably.,3
LORELAI,"Déjà vu, huh?",3
RORY,Déjà vu.,3
LORELAI,"Although, why I'd be walking into Luke's apartment like this in the future, I don't know, so put the system on the back burner.",3
JESS,Okay.,3
LORELAI,"Mmkay. Carry on, or. . .see ya.",3
LORELAI,Dude!,3
LUKE,Hey. Find it okay?,3
LORELAI,Yeah. I found everything -- including a couple coupling.,3
LUKE,"Oh, Rory and Jess?",3
LORELAI,"No, Ben and J. Lo. Yes, Rory and Jess.",3
LUKE,I guess I should've told you.,3
LORELAI,You knew they were up there?,3
LUKE,They're up there all the time.,3
LORELAI,"On the couch. . .horizontal, on the couch?",3
LUKE,They come up for air every so often.,3
LORELAI,And you just allow this? Luke!,3
LUKE,"Settle down. I go up there every ten minutes pretending to get something to keep them from doing something we don't want. ""Oops, I forgot my pocketknife."" ""Oops, uh, I'm out of ones."" ""Uh, hey, you see a case of mustard up here?"" I put the stuff in a box. I take the box upstairs every couple days and start all over again.",3
LORELAI,And you think that suffices?,3
LUKE,"Look, it's better that they're safe and upstairs than someplace else. And you going up there just now saved me a t rip, so thanks.",3
LORELAI,Glad to be of service.,3
LUKE,"I got a good system, it works.",3
LORELAI,Every ten minutes?,3
LUKE,"Like clockwork, never a minute more.",3
LORELAI,"Even if you're serving a customer, it's every ten minutes?",3
LUKE,"If I'm in mid-pour, I stop and go up.",3
LORELAI,"Ten minutes. Yeah, that's pretty much the time it took to create Rory. And that included getting dressed and freshening my lipstick.",3
LUKE,What?,3
LORELAI,Thanks for the book.,3
LUKE,,3
LORELAI,Rory?,3
RORY,I'm coming.,3
LORELAI,"Toute de suite, and I don't mean the candy.",3
RORY,"Okay, what's the packing crisis?",3
LORELAI,"That's the thing. I have no packing crisis. For the first time in my life, there is no packing crisis. See? This has never happened to me before. I'm all packed, ready to go, and fully confident that I have everything I'll need or desire.",3
RORY,So you're creating a crisis out of nostalgia?,3
LORELAI,"No, see, Alex and I talked about everything we plan to do and how he expected to dress and how I expected to dress, and we coordinated to the point where I knew each piece of clothing I had to bring, down to the Spice Girls necklace I plan to wear Saturday morning for breakfast because we agreed to keep it a little whimsical.",3
RORY,"So, not your Jonas Salk necklace?",3
LORELAI,I'm trying to become as good a planner as you.,3
RORY,"So, what's the problem?",3
LORELAI,"I have no idea what to wear on the drive. I wanna look good, obviously, but not too good that it steps on my night outfit, and I also wanna be comfortable.",3
RORY,"What's he wearing, a jogging suit?",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, and then after, he and Paulie are hitting the Bada Bing.",3
RORY,"Your point being, it's probably not a running suit.",3
LORELAI,Right.,3
RORY,And tonight's a dress?,3
LORELAI,"And, uh, my cashmere coat and a hat.",3
RORY,Your stretchy jeans and your Bunnyranch T-shirt.,3
LORELAI,"Comfort and raunch, I love it. Good. So, um, how are you guys working the logistics tonight?",3
RORY,"I am going to study at school, then I'm going straight to Grandma's from there. Jess is driving straight from work, and then he's driving me home.",3
LORELAI,Home? Home here?,3
RORY,"Yeah, he's gonna drop me off here.",3
LORELAI,"Well, I guess that makes sense.",3
RORY,I thought so.,3
LORELAI,"Although, hm, I don't know.",3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,Are you sure that's the best way to do it?,3
RORY,"Yeah, why?",3
LORELAI,"Well, it just means you're coming home to an empty house.",3
RORY,"Well, that's your doing, not mine.",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, but it might be kind of lonely here. Did you think about staying at Mom's?",3
RORY,Overnight?,3
LORELAI,"Yeah. They've got those fancy beds that don't sag, and you're guaranteed a great Norma Desmond style breakfast the next morning. You don't have school, it works out perfectly.",3
RORY,I'd rather just come home.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, sure. But, you know, staying at your grandmother's would also mean that Jess wouldn't have to go out of his way at the end of the night to drop you off. It would be much more convenient for him.",3
RORY,Our house is two-tenths of a mile out of his way.,3
LORELAI,Are you sure he's gonna have enough gas?,3
RORY,I'll make sure.,3
LORELAI,"But if you can't get a hold of him, it might be safer to plan on staying at Mom's. I mean, if you run out of gas, you're stuck. And at the mercy of the Orcs.",3
RORY,"Mom, why are you so freaked?",3
LORELAI,This is not freaked.,3
RORY,Is it because you won't be here and he will?,3
LORELAI,"Uh, it might've crossed my mind.",3
RORY,And what are you worried about happening?,3
LORELAI,"Well, what you guys were on the on-ramp for up at Luke's the other day. Your basic boy/girl stuff. Especially with this new boy, you girl stuff.",3
RORY,"Well, the boy is different, but I'm still me. That hasn't changed.",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, I know.",3
RORY,"And I have so much on my mind, so many things going on in my life, that I don't ever have time to think about that.",3
LORELAI,No thinking at all?,3
RORY,"None, I swear.",3
LORELAI,"Mmhmm, sure, sure.",3
RORY,"And we talk about everything together, you and me, remember? So it's not like something will happen that you won't know about.",3
LORELAI,,3
EMILY,"You know, you didn't have to change.",3
RORY,"Well, I feel kind of dumb being in my uniform when I'm not in school.",3
EMILY,But you look darling in it. I'm going to miss it when you go to college.,3
RORY,"Yeah, I am, too, in a way. I mean, I like not having to think about what I'm going to wear.",3
EMILY,And you'll have plenty of years to stress yourself out about that.,3
RORY,I'm sorry he's late.,3
EMILY,We're fine. Dinner will keep.,3
RORY,I know how you like things to be punctual.,3
EMILY,"There was a big tie-up on the 84 earlier. He's probably smack dab in the middle of that. Why don't you try him on his cell phone, see what's going on.",3
RORY,He doesn't have one.,3
EMILY,Really?,3
RORY,He doesn't believe in them.,3
EMILY,"Well, I find that refreshing. Technology is encroaching too fast on every aspect of life, if you ask me. It's getting to the point where people will want robots to carry them from place to place. There he is.",3
RORY,What  ,3
JESS,Sorry I'm late.,3
EMILY,"Oh, that's all right. Come in , come in. It's cold out.",3
RORY,"Um, Grandma, this is Jess. Jess, my grandmother.",3
EMILY,Nice to meet you.,3
JESS,Same here.,3
RORY,"Uh, what happened to your eye?",3
JESS,"It's a long story, I don't wanna bore you.",3
EMILY,"Oh, this is new?",3
RORY,Brand new.,3
EMILY,It looks bad. Does it hurt?,3
JESS,I'm fine.,3
RORY,Is it why you were late?,3
JESS,"No, 84 was jammed .",3
EMILY,"We knew that, too. There was something with a big rig. Oh, those things, they scare the life out of me. And apparently, all the men who drive them are hopped up on bennies and goofballs. Come, come, have a seat at the table. I'll go check on dinner.",3
JESS,Shouldn't we go with her?,3
RORY,Were you in a fight?,3
JESS,Dinner's waiting.,3
RORY,"Jess, were you in a fight?",3
JESS,"I told you, it's a long story, I don't wanna talk about it.",3
RORY,Why?,3
JESS,"Look, Rory, I'm already in a crappy mood. Traffic sucked. Traffic I hit going to a function I didn't particularly wanna go to. And I'm thirsty. And I'm hungry. So let's eat.",3
JESS,So do we eat standing up?,3
RORY,Over there.,3
EMILY,"The roast looks perfect. Oh, Jess, you eat meat, I hope. I forgot to ask.",3
JESS,I'm a carnivore.,3
EMILY,Good. I don't see how anybody can resist eating meat.,3
JESS,It's why we have teeth.,3
EMILY,"That's how I feel. Dinner parties used to be simple. Now every time we give one, I have to run my menu down with every person on the list. It's tiring. This one eats just about anything.",3
RORY,Grandma.,3
EMILY,"I'm sorry, but the way you and your mother eat, and those slim figures of yours   it's a medical marvel.",3
JESS,They should be studied.,3
RORY,I don't think so.,3
EMILY,"So, Rory tells me you're part of the Wal-Mart corporation.",3
JESS,Only out of necessity.,3
EMILY,They sound like wonderful stores.,3
JESS,"Oh, yeah, I wanna be buried there.",3
EMILY,"We've never actually been inside one, but we own the stock.",3
JESS,Thanks for the paycheck.,3
EMILY,"Oh, that's very funny.",3
RORY,Did you just get it?,3
JESS,Huh?,3
RORY,The eye   did it just happen?,3
JESS,"You know, we should eat these salads so the roast doesn't get cold.",3
RORY,"I mean, it must be sometime between nine last night and now.",3
EMILY,Hm?,3
RORY,His eye.,3
JESS,"Yeah, it was sometime in there.",3
RORY,But you can't narrow it down?,3
JESS,"Rory, come on.",3
EMILY,"Oh my God, there's no salt and pepper on this table. We'll need it for the meat. These people are supposed to be trained before I get them, but God knows that's never the case.",3
JESS,What is your problem?,3
RORY,"You're not telling me the truth, that's my problem.",3
JESS,I don't wanna get into it here.,3
RORY,And it's obvious why.,3
JESS,"Oh, is it?",3
RORY,You got into a fight with Dean.,3
JESS,Unbelievable.,3
RORY,Is that it?,3
JESS,It always comes back to Dean.,3
RORY,Because you bring it there.,3
JESS,You brought up Dean.,3
RORY,Because you got into a fight with him.,3
JESS,Why are you pressing this? Why? I'm trying to make some kind of quasi-positive impression on your grandmother per your request and you're forcing me to do otherwise. And what the hell are raisins doing in a salad? Why can't people leave well enough alone?,3
RORY,"Well, in that whole speech, I didn't hear you deny it.",3
EMILY,"We've got great choices on the prime rib. How do you like your prime rib, Jess?",3
JESS,Cooked.,3
RORY,"He's not picky, Grandma.",3
EMILY,"Good, that'll make it easier. So, what did I miss?",3
JESS,Nothing. Absolutely nothing.,3
RORY,"Grandma, would it be all right if I speak to Jess for a second? We can go to the study.",3
JESS,We're eating.,3
RORY,"Well, I want to talk.",3
JESS,"You're being a little rude to your grandmother, Rory.",3
EMILY,I can leave the room for a minute if you want.,3
RORY,"No, Grandma, we'll be right back.",3
RORY,"I told you nothing happened at Patty's, but you just wouldn't believe it. You had to get into a fight with Dean tonight right before meeting my grandmother. This is a disaster.",3
JESS,I did not get into a fight with Dean.,3
RORY,Bull.,3
JESS,Believe what you want.,3
RORY,"I'm going to find out eventually, so why keep it from me?",3
JESS,What if Dean had sucker-punched me and I had to defend myself? You're not even considering the possibility that that's what happened?,3
RORY,Dean wouldn't do that.,3
JESS,"Oh, no, he might get his big white Stetson dirty.",3
RORY,"You're being a jerk to my grandmother, too.",3
JESS,"Hey, I'm doing my best. If that means I'm being a jerk, then that's what I am. I didn't even wanna come.",3
RORY,No one made you.,3
JESS,You made me. Now I've seen it all.,3
RORY,You embarrassed me in front of her.,3
JESS,"That's it, I've had it.",3
RORY,So have I.,3
JESS,"If you're gonna harp on this, I'm leaving.",3
RORY,"Oh, great, so now I have to explain to my Grandma why my boyfriend who showed up a half- hour late with a black eye is walking out.",3
JESS,"Well, you like making up stories in your head so that should be easy for you.",3
EMILY,Is he fetching something from his car?,3
RORY,I don't think so.,3
EMILY,He left.,3
RORY,"Yeah, he left.",3
EMILY,,3
JACKSON,"So, good, good show.",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, yeah. Alex, thank you for getting us those tickets.",3
SOOKIE,Great production value.,3
JACKSON,"Oh, amazing. I mean, the way they do lighting on these things.",3
SOOKIE,"It's magical, it's magical.",3
ALEX,This is the worst piece of crap I've ever seen.,3
LORELAI,What?,3
ALEX,I saw Moose Murders. This stinks worse.,3
SOOKIE,I thought it was me.,3
JACKSON,I was dying in there.,3
LORELAI,Every song is the same.,3
SOOKIE,The same two notes.,3
LORELAI,How does that happen?,3
SOOKIE,"I feel so very bad. Yes, I feel so very sad.",3
LORELAI,"I'm sad, I'm mad , I'm sad, I'm ma d.",3
SOOKIE,"I'm mad , I'm sad, I'm mad , I'm sad.",3
JACKSON,"I'm sorry   that's better, rent a theater.",3
ALEX,"Look, I say we hit a bar, get some drinks, continue plotting out this musical you guys are writing.",3
LORELAI,Cool. We'll need pens and paper.,3
SOOKIE,"Just memo rize it. I'm mad , I'm sad, I'm mad, I'm sad.",3
JACKSON,We'll grab a cab.,3
SOOKIE,"Hey, that fits right in.",3
LORELAI,You're nice.,3
ALEX,I try.,3
ALEX,Who are you expecting?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, Rory. I mean, not that I'm expecting a call because a call could mean something bad, so, um, not getting a call is probably best.",3
ALEX,Probably.,3
LORELAI,I'm just gonna give her a call.,3
ALEX,"You know, on the drive down here, you made me promise to stop you if you were gonna call Rory for the wrong reason.",3
LORELAI,But I left the iron on.,3
ALEX,She'll turn it off.,3
LORELAI,She's got this boy.,3
ALEX,I know.,3
LORELAI,I shouldn't call her.,3
ALEX,It's up to you.,3
JACKSON,"Hey guys, we got a cab, and the driver likes our song.",3
LORELAI,Putting away phone now.,3
ALEX,,3
RORY,Hello?,3
LORELAI,Good morning.,3
RORY,Hey. It's early. Why are you calling so early?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, I don't know. I must've screwed up the time difference. What time is it there?",3
RORY,The same time it is there.,3
LORELAI,"Ah, sorry.",3
RORY,How's it going?,3
LORELAI,Good. A lot of walking. We all had pizza at John's in the village and wrote a musical.,3
RORY,Good for you.,3
LORELAI,"Then we picked the same D ean Martin song on the jukebox twenty-five times and people started complaining, so we picked the Bee Gees' ""New York Mining Disaster"" and they begged for Dean Martin back.",3
RORY,Sounds fun.,3
LORELAI,"So, how'd the dinner go?",3
RORY,"Uh, not well. Far from well.",3
LORELAI,What?,3
RORY,I'm at Grandma's.,3
LORELAI,You stayed the night?,3
RORY,Yup.,3
LORELAI,What did she do? Did she make you stay because she didn't want Jess to drive you home? She is so untrusting. And to ruin this dinner   I'm gonna k*ll her.,3
RORY,"No, Grandma was great. The whole time, even when Jess was late.",3
LORELAI,You're kidding.,3
RORY,She was a saint. Staying over was my idea.,3
LORELAI,Why?,3
RORY,Jess and I got into the most horrible fight of my life and it was. . .ugh. I can't even say.,3
LORELAI,I don't believe this.,3
RORY,He showed up with a big black eye.,3
LORELAI,A black guy?,3
RORY,"Eye, a black eye. He got into a fight.",3
LORELAI,"With who, Dean?",3
RORY,"He wouldn't say, but yes, and he was all standoffish about it and things got worse and worse and he walked out. It was all horrible.",3
LORELAI,"Wow, honey. I'm sorry. Are you okay?",3
RORY,"I'm upset, but I'm okay.",3
EMILY,"Oh, I thought I heard you up. How  bout some breakfast?",3
RORY,Sure.,3
EMILY,Is that Jess?,3
RORY,"No, it's Mom.",3
LORELAI,"Hey, put her on.",3
RORY,She wants to talk to you. Bye.,3
LORELAI,See ya tonight.,3
EMILY,Hello?,3
LORELAI,"Mom, hi, listen. Rory kind of explained what happened last night, and how you were really great about it. I just wanted to thank you. I mean, I don't know all the details, but I'm sure it all could've been way worse, and you keeping your cool like that was really, really nice. Thanks.",3
EMILY,How can you let your daughter be with that abominable thug?,3
LORELAI,Mom  ,3
EMILY,"First he arrives late, how disrespectful is that? Then he's rude to Rory, rude to me.",3
LORELAI,Mom  ,3
EMILY,,3
ZACH,"Yo, dude, that's disrespectful.",3
DAVE,We're really early. Let's get something to eat.,3
ZACH,"Sure, what do we want?",3
BRIAN,I've only got three bucks.,3
ZACH,"You always only got three bucks. What is it, you go to an ATM that only gives out three bucks at a time?",3
DAVE,Let's just pick.,3
BRIAN,"Well, I'm sick of burgers, so if it could be a place that has more than burgers  ",3
ZACH,"What do you want, like a three-dollar sushi place?",3
BRIAN,It doesn't have to be sushi.,3
DAVE,"Guys, shut up and be cool. Don't say a thing.",3
BRIAN,"What, why?",3
DAVE,,3
KIM,David.,3
ZACH,David?,3
BRIAN,,3
KIM,How do you know Lane?,3
ZACH,She's a great dr  ,3
DAVE,,3
KIM,"Who are you? What is all this, David? Who are all these unwashed boys?",3
DAVE,,3
KIM,A combo?,3
DAVE,,3
KIM,"Oh, good. With just a guitar it can sound thin.",3
DAVE,,3
KIM,"Wait, I want to warn you about something.",3
DAVE,,3
KIM,About Lane. She has a crush on you.,3
DAVE,,3
KIM,"I thought you should know. She's a good girl, but flighty sometimes. Be careful around her. I know you're a serious boy, I don't want you to be shocked.",3
DAVE,,3
KIM,"Okay. Maybe I'll book your combo sometime, mix it up a little.",3
DAVE,"It would be our pleasure. Right, guys?",3
ZACH,Yeah.,3
BRIAN,,3
KIM,Don't speed.,3
DAVE,,3
RORY,Hey.,3
DEAN,"Hey there. Did you see those fliers? Apparently, I clicked my heels for joy after one of her songs. I don't rememb er that.",3
RORY,Me neither. Can I talk to you for a sec?,3
DEAN,"Well, yeah, what's wrong?",3
RORY,"Dean, this whole friend thing with us isn't going to work if we're not honest with each other.",3
DEAN,I agree.,3
RORY,"Okay, so, anything you wanna tell me?",3
DEAN,Corn's two for a dollar?,3
RORY,Jess has a black eye.,3
DEAN,Oh yeah?,3
RORY,Any idea where he got it?,3
DEAN,That would be an extremely long list.,3
RORY,It wasn't you?,3
DEAN,It wasn't me.,3
RORY,You swear?,3
DEAN,I swear. Did he say it was me?,3
RORY,"No, he's not saying anything. He's less talkative than some.",3
DEAN,"Yeah, sorry, I have no idea. Look, I really don't like talking about  ",3
RORY,"I know, sorry, I  ",3
DEAN,I should get back to work.,3
RORY,"Okay, thanks.",3
DEAN,Sorry I couldn't solve the mystery.,3
RORY,,3
LUKE,Whoa.,3
JESS,What?,3
LUKE,You're Petey the dog.,3
JESS,I prefer to not talk about this.,3
LUKE,Is that why you snuck in last night?,3
JESS,"I did not sneak in. Now, could we get back to work here?",3
LUKE,"Fine, start clearing some stuff. So when'd you get into a fight with Dean?",3
JESS,It wasn't a fight with Dean.,3
LUKE,"Whoa, where's that coming from? I just asked.",3
JESS,What's with everybody making assumptions? I'm sick of it.,3
LUKE,So it wasn't Dean.,3
JESS,No.,3
LUKE,"When did it happen, yesterday?",3
JESS,Yes.,3
LUKE,You went to Rory's grandmother yesterday. She punch you?,3
JESS,Stop.,3
LUKE,Where'd you get it?,3
JESS,Santa Claus.,3
LUKE,So you're not gonna tell me?,3
JESS,That's right.,3
LUKE,"Hello? Yeah, hey Rory, hang on a sec. It's Rory.",3
JESS,I'm not here.,3
LUKE,What?,3
JESS,"Get a clue, Columbo. I don't wanna talk to her.",3
LUKE,"You don't wanna talk to Rory? Yeah, Rory? Yeah, he just went someplace. Yeah, I'll tell him. Bye.",3
LUKE,Come on.,3
JESS,Hey.,3
JESS,"Come on, what is this?",3
LUKE,"Look, you're my responsibility. You're exhibiting signs of violent behavior and I don't care how much you don't wanna talk about it, you're not leaving until you tell me. Now, tell me, where'd you get the black eye?",3
JESS,You wouldn't believe it anyway.,3
LUKE,"Try me, tough guy.",3
JESS,A swan.,3
LUKE,Excuse me?,3
JESS,"I was att*cked by a swan. Okay, you happy? A stupid swan.",3
LUKE,"Now, how  bout the real story?",3
JESS,That is the real story. It hangs out by Larson's Dock. I was just walking by and the thing came out of nowhere and bam   beaked me right in the eye.,3
LUKE,It beaked you?,3
JESS,You still don't believe me.,3
LUKE,I just never heard anyone use the word beaked as a verb before.,3
JESS,"No, no, this isn't funny. That stupid bird att*cked me. He could've blinded me. It's a vicious, vicious bird, and . . .fine. Forget it.",3
LUKE,What are you doing? Where are you going?,3
JESS,I'm gonna do a little beaking of my own.,3
LUKE,,3
LUKE,I don't see a swan.,3
JESS,Put your oars down.,3
LUKE,They don't like oars?,3
JESS,"Just lay low, it'll come.",3
LUKE,Does it act all peaceful and Bambi-like and then suddenly attack like the rabbit in Monty Python?,3
JESS,Your voice is probably scaring it away.,3
LUKE,So how'd you explain the black eye to the Gilmores?,3
JESS,I didn't. The whole night sucked. I'm happy it's behind me.,3
LUKE,Behind you? You ain't got nothing behind you.,3
JESS,What do you mean?,3
LUKE,You'll have plenty more events like that in your future.,3
JESS,No way.,3
LUKE,"When you date a girl like Rory, you're involved with her whole family. Just like that last girl you dated, you were involved with her whole petri dish.",3
JESS,At least she was easy to figure out.,3
LUKE,And you were bored from day one.,3
JESS,"I'm dating Rory, not her family.",3
LUKE,All these people come in a package with this girl. The mother comes with this girl. The grandmother comes with this girl.,3
JESS,"And apparently a bunch of others. Everybody she's ever met, including Dean.",3
LUKE,She picked you.,3
JESS,God knows why.,3
LUKE,"She knows, that's all that matters. Jess, being jealous of Dean  ",3
JESS,I am not jealous of Dean.,3
LUKE,"Being jealous of Dean is pointless. You're just gonna drive Rory away. You wanna have a relationship with someone, you're gonna have to learn to open up your mouth and say something.",3
JESS,"Give it a rest, Dr. Phil.",3
LUKE,"You can't shut down, you can't avoid her calls.",3
JESS,I didn't wanna talk.,3
LUKE,"Well, when are you gonna wanna talk?",3
JESS,I don't know.,3
LUKE,"So, what are you gonna do, just keep avoiding her and never take her calls again?",3
JESS,She'll find me ev entually.,3
LUKE,If she keeps looking for you.,3
JESS,"Hey, I'm not gonna be a wuss like Dean.",3
LUKE,"Dean had that girl for two years. You have a little fight after two months, you walk out, and it's over?",3
JESS,I don't care.,3
LUKE,"Okay, fine, you don't care, that's obvious.",3
JESS,Shh!,3
LUKE,Is that the one?,3
JESS,That's it. Watch it.,3
LUKE,I'm watching it. It's pretty.,3
JESS,Shh!,3
LUKE,Is it gonna double back?,3
JESS,Maybe.,3
LUKE,So it's lulling us into complacency.,3
JESS,"He's vicious, I'm telling you.",3
LUKE,"Yeah, his butt's terrifying.",3
JESS,It's outnumbered. That's the problem. It knows there's two of us.,3
LUKE,"So you want me to get under water, swim along with the boat, breathe through a straw?",3
JESS,Forget it.,3
LUKE,"Maybe it's gonna get another swan and come back and make a fight of it, huh?",3
JESS,,3
LANE,"He's not even calling you back, huh?",3
RORY,"No, and I'm not sure what to do.",3
LANE,"Well, Dave and I have never had a fight because we haven't really truly begun dating, so I have no perspective on this.",3
RORY,"Well, you'd better hurry up and start having bad boy troubles so I can get some feedback.",3
DAVE,Hey there.,3
LANE,Hi guys.,3
RORY,How's it going?,3
ZACH,"I think it's going a little weird, to tell you the truth.",3
LANE,"Weird, why?",3
BRIAN,I think we need to get something out in the open here.,3
ZACH,Definitely.,3
DAVE,We ran into your mom.,3
LANE,My mom?,3
RORY,Oh boy.,3
ZACH,"Yeah, and we're well aware that there's a situation here that you guys have been hiding.",3
BRIAN,We should get it out in the open here or else it's gonna get weirder.,3
DAVE,"Yeah, I guess so. We didn't mean anything by hiding it guys.",3
ZACH,"Well, what pisses us off is that you felt you had to hide it.",3
DAVE,Really?,3
ZACH,"Yeah. Dave, you're a Christian. So what? That's cool.",3
BRIAN,It's nothing to hide.,3
ZACH,Christians can still rock.,3
DAVE,They can?,3
LANE,"Yeah, yeah, Dave. Christians can still rock, don't hide it.",3
ZACH,Marshall Stacks don't know Christians from atheists.,3
DAVE,"Gosh, I just wasn't sure if you guys would be accepting of my devoutness.",3
BRIAN,"Dave, it's a part of you, and we think you're cool, so it's cool.",3
DAVE,"Great. Thanks, guys.",3
ZACH,"But no way are we playing Creed, man.",3
DAVE,"Oh, no, of course not.",3
ZACH,Or Amy Grant. That's where we draw the line.,3
LANE,This is very accepting of you guys.,3
BRIAN,And we'd be totally into playing that gig for your mom if it pays.,3
LANE,"Oh, Mrs. Kim pays. Uh, she's very good about that.",3
RORY,That's my mom. I'm glad this all worked out.,3
LANE,"Yeah, me too.",3
RORY,Hey.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, my little daughter.",3
RORY,I'm happy to see you. Thanks for bringing her back in one piece.,3
ALEX,No problem.,3
LORELAI,I'm very weak.,3
ALEX,She hasn't eaten in awhile.,3
RORY,I warned you to keep to her feeding schedule.,3
LORELAI,"I'm drifting, drifting.",3
ALEX,She wanted to wait to have dinner with you.,3
RORY,That's sweet.,3
LORELAI,Must have food now.,3
RORY,I'll take it from here.,3
ALEX,Thanks.,3
LORELAI,Bye. You're not food.,3
ALEX,Revive her.,3
RORY,I will. I'm gonna run and get take out.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, make like the wind.",3
RORY,Can you make it to the door?,3
LORELAI,,3
JESS,Rory.,3
RORY,"Oh, hey.",3
JESS,Hey. Your mom home?,3
RORY,I'm bringing supplies.,3
JESS,Should've brought a mule.,3
RORY,What?,3
JESS,"A pack mule, to carry it.",3
RORY,"Oh, yeah.",3
JESS,"So, sorry I missed your calls.",3
RORY,You were always out.,3
JESS,"Yeah. I was getting ready to call you just now, but you would've been out.",3
RORY,Ironic.,3
JESS,Yeah.,3
RORY,"So, I know there was no fight with Dean.",3
JESS,Really? How? You asked Dean.,3
RORY,It was the only thing I could think to do.,3
JESS,To go to the source.,3
RORY,Yup. I'm sorry I doubted you.,3
JESS,"It's okay. I would've doubted me, too.",3
RORY,I need to trust you as much as I trusted  ,3
JESS,Him.,3
RORY,Yeah.,3
JESS,This black eye screwed everything up.,3
RORY,Yeah.,3
JESS,"Next time I go to your grandmother's, I'll try not to have one.",3
RORY,Next time?,3
JESS,Next time.,3
RORY,So what happened?,3
JESS,I don't  ,3
RORY,"Come on. It wasn't Dean, you can say.",3
JESS,Will that make you happy?,3
RORY,"Yes, very.",3
JESS,"Okay, I'll tell you the truth, since we're both so into the truth tonight. That's what good relationships are about, right?",3
RORY,Right.,3
JESS,"But you've gotta promise not to mock me ever, and please don't tell anyone else.",3
RORY,Promise.,3
JESS,I was throwing a football with a buddy and got hit in the eye.,3
RORY,You poor thing.,3
JESS,Yeah.,3
RORY,But that's not embarrassing.,3
JESS,"Yeah, now that you mention it, it's not.",3
RORY,I have to go.,3
JESS,Don't go.,3
RORY,I don't want to.,3
JESS,Then don't. Let's go somewhere.,3
RORY,I've got takeout.,3
JESS,I'll reimburse you.,3
RORY,My mom's waiting. Keep thinking what you're thinking.,3
JESS,,3
RORY,Mom?,3
LORELAI,"Hm? Is that you, Rhett?",3
RORY,I bring food.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, thank God. Ha! One of everything at Al's. Bless you with gluttony. Aren't you hungry?",3
RORY,Yeah.,3
LORELAI,"Well, come on, dig in. What's wrong?",3
RORY,"Nothing. Um, listen.",3
LORELAI,I'm listening.,3
RORY,"When I said before that I was too busy to think about it, I realized now that I'm not too busy to think about it.",3
LORELAI,Think about it?,3
RORY,About it.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, it.",3
RORY,"Yeah, it.",3
LORELAI,"Ha, it.",3
RORY,"Nothing's happened yet, but. . .it might. Maybe.",3
LORELAI,Maybe?,3
RORY,Maybe. . .with Jess.,3
LORELAI,"Hm, with Jess.",3
RORY,"You still want me to tell you everything, right?",3
LORELAI,"Yeah. Uh, no. Well  ",3
RORY,Which is it?,3
LORELAI,We're doing this now.,3
RORY,Yes. Which is it?,3
LORELAI,I don't know.,3
RORY,You'll let me know?,3
LORELAI,Yeah.,3
RORY,"Was that, yeah, you'll let me know, or yeah, that's your answer, you wanna know?",3
LORELAI,"I guess, I wanna know, yes, and now, sure.",3
RORY,"Well, nothing's happened.",3
LORELAI,I heard.,3
RORY,But it might.,3
LORELAI,Okay. Could you tell me before it does?,3
RORY,"Right before, or  ",3
LORELAI,"No, just. . .just before.",3
RORY,Okay.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, good. Is that it?",3
RORY,"For tonight, yeah.",3
LORELAI,Good. This. . .this is good.,3

TAYLORory,"So, I have talked to every memb er of my family and we agreed that you can hold the rooms on my credit card, but everyone must check out with their own.",3
LORELAI,Got it.,3
TAYLORory,Have we gone over the room arrangements yet?,3
LORELAI,Closing in on a hundred and fifty times.,3
TAYLORory,"Well, the Doose clan is very, very particular about their accommodations. We are light sleepers and are prone to night terrors, and several of us are very allergic to bed clothing, so it's very important that we are  ",3
LORELAI,"On the first floor or near a fire escape. Yes, Taylor, I know, it's all taken care of. Um, Taylor, could you just hang on a second? I'll be right back.",3
TAYLORory,"Oh, all right, but hurry. I don't have all day.",3
LORELAI,Hey. You were supposed to bring me a cup of coffee.,3
RORY,"Yes, I know. I'm sorry, I got distracted.",3
JESS,My fault.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, but see, when you left me there, I was alone, and now, look, I'm no longer alone.",3
RORY,Taylor found you?,3
LORELAI,"Yes, and we've since embarked on hour one hundred millionth of planning the special Doose reunion.",3
RORY,I'm coming back over there right now.,3
Posted,03/02/03 16:47,3
LORELAI,"Yes, and then you are going to get very sick and be unable to feed yourself so that Mommy will need to take you home an d stay by your side until the Doose reunion is over.",3
RORY,Okay.,3
LORELAI,Okay. Say goodbye to Jess.,3
RORY,Bye Jess.,3
JESS,I'll call you later.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, limp a little if you can.",3
RORY,"Uh, what malady do I have that makes me limp and lose ability to feed myself?",3
LORELAI,It's French.,3
RORY,Okay.,3
LORELAI,"Taylor, listen, we're gonna need to finish this up a little later. Rory's not feeling so good.",3
TAYLORory,"Oh no, what's the matter?",3
RORY,It's French.,3
TAYLORory,"All right. Well, I think we're just about done here anyhow. Oh, before I forget, let me give you each one of these.",3
RORY,"""Stars Hollow Hockey, 2003 semifinalists. Go Minutemen. The future is yours. Bring this button to Doose's for fifty percent off your next purchase of Stove Top Stuffing."" Wow, that's a lot of words for a tiny button.",3
TAYLORory,I expect to see both of you wearing them at the game tomorrow night.,3
LORELAI,"Well, we'll try to make it.",3
TAYLORory,"Try to make it? My dear, do you realize that this is the first time we've been in the regional semifinals in forty-three years?",3
RORY,But didn't we only make it this far because the Litchfield team got food poisoning?,3
TAYLORory,"Well, I admit it's not exactly the plot of Hoosiers, but still it's very, very exciting.",3
LORELAI,"Well, it's nice that you and your family are so loyal to the home team.",3
TAYLORory,"Oh, the Dooses have been the backbone of Stars Hollow High hockey for years. I, myself, was the goalkeeper for our team in the last regional finals.",3
LORELAI,I did not know that.,3
TAYLORory,Oh yes. I was responsible for the game-winning goal.,3
LUKE,So the puck just ricocheted off your head and into the net?,3
TAYLORory,Still counted.,3
LUKE,"For God's sake, I was making a joke. You really got pucked in the head?",3
TAYLORory,"No, I was making a joke, too. Uh, Lorelai, just one more  ",3
TAYLORory,"What a disgrace, making that poor sick girl run.",3
LUKE,,3
RICHARD,"So, Rory, how are things at Chilton?",3
RORY,"Great, great, everything's great.",3
RICHARD,"And, uh, Lorelai, things at the inn are good?",3
LORELAI,"Mm, mmhmm, hm.",3
RICHARD,"Oh, Rory, please slow down and chew your food properly.",3
LORELAI,I'm always telling her that. Pass the butter.,3
RORY,Pass the peas.,3
LORELAI,Pass the pork.,3
RORY,Pass your plate.,3
RICHARD,"I'm sorry, is there a race going on I don't know about?",3
EMILY,"That was your mother, Richard. She just wanted to make sure that all our towels are Egyptian cotton.",3
RICHARD,"Well, it's a simple question.",3
EMILY,It's her fortieth simple question of the day.,3
RICHARD,"Well, she's going to be staying with us, Emily. She just wants to know she'll be comfortable.",3
EMILY,"Yes, because we usually give our guests the towels we've stolen from the Holiday Inn.",3
RORY,Great Grandma's coming to stay with you?,3
RICHARD,"Just for a few days, um, while her floors are being redone.",3
LORELAI,"So, how's Gran doing?",3
RORY,"Yeah, does she miss London?",3
EMILY,Not half as much as I do.,3
RICHARD,Emily.,3
EMILY,I never really truly appreciated the Atlantic Ocean before. Three thousand lovely miles of water.,3
RICHARD,You are talking about my mother.,3
EMILY,"I know that, Richard. And I'm happy to have her stay here, but must she keep interrupting the one dinner a week that we have with Lorelai and Rory? She knows what time we dine   and why are you two eating so quickly?",3
LORELAI,We're not eating quickly.,3
RORY,"Yeah, you've been on the phone for awhile. It probably just seems like we've eaten a lot.",3
EMILY,I wonder who that could be.,3
RICHARD,Emily.,3
EMILY,"Well, aren't we popular? Richard, perhaps you could get that while I have another bath sheet versus bath towel debate with your mother.",3
LORELAI,You're giving it away!,3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,You're eating too quickly.,3
RORY,What? You said that we had to be out of here by 8:30.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, but I didn't tell you to broadcast it.",3
RORY,I'm eat ing at the same speed you are.,3
LORELAI,But you're eating small bites very fast. You've gotta eat bigger bites at a normal speed.,3
RORY,You mean I should risk choking so we can make our Friday night plans?,3
LORELAI,Exactly.,3
RICHARD,I apologize for that.,3
LORELAI,Collection agency again?,3
RICHARD,Excuse me?,3
EMILY,"Thank goodness she called. Richard, did you know people actually expect there to be soap in their bathrooms when they. . .",3
EMILY,Why are there strange men hauling a mattress up my staircase?,3
RICHARD,"Well, now, Emily  ",3
EMILY,She sent her own mattress?,3
RICHARD,"Well, she has a very sensitive back.",3
EMILY,She sent her own mattress?,3
RICHARD,I'll go and supervise.,3
LORELAI,"Well, Mom, it looks like you got a lot going on here.",3
RORY,With the mattresses and the phone calls.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, so we're just gonna go and get out of your hair.",3
EMILY,Hold it right there. What is going on with you two?,3
LORELAI,What are you talking about?,3
EMILY,"You know exactly what I'm talking about. Bolting down your food, leaving before dessert, Rory checking her pager every five minutes. What do you have planned? Fine, we'll just sit here until one of you feels like filling me in .",3
LORELAI,She has a date!,3
RORY,So does she!,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, but hers starts a half-hour earlier than mine!",3
RORY,Because you get to stay out later!,3
LORELAI,Because I'm the mom!,3
EMILY,"You two, stop it right now! You're behaving like children.",3
LORELAI,Sorry.,3
RORY,"Yeah, sorry.",3
EMILY,"Our deal is for Friday night dinners, not appearances at Friday night dinners. Now, you willsit there and you will eat your dessert.",3
LORELAI,But  ,3
EMILY,One more word and I throw in a game of charades.,3
RORY,"Yes, ma'am.",3
LORELAI,,3
LORELAI,"Oh, we gotta get a faster car!",3
RORY,"Hey, don't blame the car.",3
LORELAI,So you're saying it's my fault we're late?,3
RORY,"Who was the one who said, ""Hey, I've got room for another piece of pie.""",3
LORELAI,"Ah! You kept making all that pointless conversation, all those thank you's and please's. What, are you running for Miss Congeniality?",3
RORY,Just get ready.,3
LORELAI,What time ar e you meet ing Jess?,3
RORY,"I don't know, I'll tell you in a sec.",3
LORELAI,"Have you seen my brown boots? I cannot go out without those brown boots. My entire outfit was retrofitted around those practically   Oh! Wait, can you believe it? Hey, they were in my closet. What sort of bizarre accident of fate put them there?",3
LORELAI,"What? He didn't call? Well, maybe it's too early. What time is it?",3
RORY,9:15.,3
LORELAI,And when did he say he would call?,3
RORY,When he got off work.,3
LORELAI,Which was when?,3
RORY,It varies.,3
LORELAI,"I'm sorry, I thought you guys had a plan.",3
RORY,We did.,3
LORELAI,And the plan was that he calls you whenever because his work time varies?,3
RORY,Yes.,3
LORELAI,"Good plan. Bay of Pigs, was that yours, too?",3
RORY,He'll call.,3
LORELAI,"Hey, look, you wanna come out with me and Alex? We might go see a midnight movie if something really bad is playing.",3
RORY,"No, thanks.",3
LORELAI,Just promise me you won't sit here all night staring at the phone.,3
RORY,Happy?,3
LORELAI,"Delirious. Oh, I should not have had that second piece of pie.",3
RORY,Full?,3
LORELAI,"No, just late.",3
RORY,Bring me some M ilk Duds.,3
LORELAI,,3
RORY,"Then I spent about forty minutes cleaning out my hard drive. You would not believe the amount of junk that accumulates   old files, things you've downloaded but never opened. It really slows down your CPU.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, I hate a slow CPU.",3
RORY,"Then, all of a sudden, I looked down and I saw all this hair and dust between the keys of my keyboard.",3
LORELAI,"So, naturally, you cleaned your keyboard.",3
RORY,"Yes, and I'll tell you, it was a strangely satisfying experience.",3
LORELAI,"Uh huh. One question. During this time that you watched TV, did homework, proofread articles for The Franklin, organized my sock drawer, returned emails and gave a much needed cleaning to your computer, did it ever occur to you to call him?",3
RORY,No.,3
LORELAI,Why?,3
RORY,Because he said he'd call me.,3
LORELAI,"Right. Okay, so then I'm guessing you're not gonna mention anything to him about your extremely productive evening alone when you see him either.",3
RORY,Why should I?,3
LORELAI,No reason I can think of.,3
LORELAI,"You know, I almost like it better like this.",3
RORY,It is more festive.,3
LORELAI,Good luck tonight!,3
RORY,"Sure, when Dean said he'd call, he always called, but where's the fun in that?",3
LORELAI,"Oh, honey, don't do that.",3
RORY,Do what?,3
LORELAI,"Compare Dean and Jess, that's not fair. They're different people.",3
RORY,Clearly. One calls when he says he will and one doesn't.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, for starters, I think you have to realize something   you were really lucky with Dean. He was an exceptional first boyfriend, and you got spoiled. Most of us didn't have first boyfriends like Dean. Most of us had first boyfriends like Brian Hutchins.",3
RORY,Brian Hutchins?,3
LORELAI,"Seventh grade, I'm sitting in the library, walks up, asks me to go steady. I say yes. He walks away and I don't see him again until the tenth grade when he tries to sell me a dimebag at the Sadies Hawkins Day dance. And he was way overcharging for it, too.",3
RORY,That's demented.,3
LORELAI,"Well, that's what most of us had to put up with. Where do you think the Susan Faludi's of the world came from?",3
RORY,"So, you're telling me this is just the way it is, and I have to get used to Jess not calling when he says he will?",3
LORELAI,"No, I'm saying you just have to realize that every guy is different. Give Jess a chance to explain before you freeze him out.",3
RORY,Okay.,3
RORY,Jess.,3
JESS,Hey. That table's clean if you want it.,3
LORELAI,"Well, I hope that cleared it up for you.",3
RORY,Not a word. Not even a lame-o apology that is obviously a lie.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, how dare he not lie to you.",3
LUKE,"Finally, two people who don't give a damn about hockey.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, someone's testy.",3
LUKE,"Well, just look at these dippy people with their buttons and their pennants. You'd think the town had never been in a semi-regional playoff before.",3
RORY,But hasn't it been like forty years?,3
LUKE,"Yeah, for the hockey team, yeah. But back when I was on the track team, we went to state three times in four years and won it twice. Think they made buttons and put up banners? They couldn't care less.",3
LORELAI,"Well, Luke, that's because track is for dorks.",3
RORY,"Yeah, it's true. I'm sorry.",3
LUKE,"Okay, the conversing part of this morning is now over. What do you want?",3
LORELAI,"Jack omelet, bacon on the side.",3
RORY,Three blueberry and two lemon poppy seed muffins to go. Lane's band is rehearsing at my house. I wanted to bring them something.,3
LUKE,"You got that, Jess?",3
JESS,Yup.,3
LUKE,Be right back.,3
JESS,Five muffins to go.,3
RORY,Thank you. I'll see you later.,3
JESS,"What was that, you guys in a fight or something?",3
LORELAI,"No, you are.",3
JESS,What are you talking about?,3
LORELAI,"Last night, didn't you guys have plans to do something?",3
JESS,I don't know. I just said I'd call her after work.,3
LORELAI,And did you?,3
JESS,"I had to work another shift, I didn't get off until midnight. It was too late to call.",3
LORELAI,And you couldn't have taken two seconds at work to call and tell her that?,3
JESS,No.,3
LORELAI,"Really? You don't get breaks? Do you get food, water? Should I get Michael Moore on thephone?",3
JESS,Whatever. I gotta unload some boxes.,3
LORELAI,,3
LANE,"See, I knew once my mom found out Dave was part of a Christian trio, it was only a matter of time before she booked him to play at one of her prayer meetings.",3
RORY,It's perfect. Now your mom's gonna get to know the whole band.,3
LANE,"Not just get to know them, but love them the way she loves Dave.",3
RORY,Your mom loves Dave?,3
LANE,"She said he's a righteous young man who's proven he can be trusted around antique furniture. In her book, that's pretty close to love.",3
RORY,"Oh, sure.",3
ZACH,"""A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing."" Dude, what's a bulwark?",3
BRIAN,What?,3
ZACH,"It says, a bulwark never failing.",3
BRIAN,I think it's a wall.,3
ZACH,Then why don't they just say that? Bulwark sounds totally gay.,3
BRIAN,I don't think you're supposed to call a hymn gay. It's like a sin or something.,3
ZACH,"Whatever, man. I'm not saying bulwark.",3
RORY,"So, Dave, Lane just gets to sit back and watch you guys play tonight, huh? You're like a groupie.",3
DAVE,"No, actually, she's got a date.",3
RORY,What?,3
LANE,"Oh, yeah. Rememb er Young Chui, the guy my mom introduced me to at the wedding? She arranged for him to take me to the hockey game tonight.",3
RORY,Oh.,3
DAVE,It's the first of three dates.,3
RORY,The first of three?,3
DAVE,Then he's gonna dump her.,3
RORY,"Young Chui, the guy you haven't gone out with yet?",3
LANE,"Yes. And I'll be crushed, making my mom feel so guilty about setting me up with him that she'll have to let me go out with Dave to make up for it.",3
DAVE,I came up with that twist.,3
LANE,Dave has a natural gift for subterfuge.,3
DAVE,"Wow, a compliment from the master.",3
LANE,"I would've thought of it myself, but I let him take the credit.",3
RORY,Men sometimes need that.,3
ZACH,"I'm telling you dude, it doesn't make any sense.",3
BRIAN,"Fine, stop yelling at me. I didn't write it.",3
DAVE,"Whoa, whoa. Uh, what's wrong?",3
ZACH,"This stupid song, man. ""For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe."" I mean, who talks like that, the Pope?",3
BRIAN,"Dude, is any of those lemon poppy seed?",3
DAVE,"Well, can't you update it a little?",3
ZACH,"Sure, man. Just tell me w hat the hell it means. It's like in Latin or something.",3
BRIAN,"I thought there was gonna be coffee, too.",3
ZACH,"Dude, can you chill out about your freaking elevensees  til we get this song straightened out?",3
BRIAN,"I'm hypoglycemic. If I don't get something in my system, I'm gonna crash.",3
DAVE,Is abi-death a word?,3
RORY,But how are you gonna make Young Chui dump you? Just be a really bad date?,3
LANE,"Oh, no, we've already talked to him. He's totally on board.",3
RORY,Really?,3
LANE,"Oh, yeah. See, he's in love with this Japanese girl named Karen who his parents don't approve of, so he and Karen see each other secretly while his parents keep setting him up with nice Korean girls. He's the male me.",3
RORY,Gotcha.,3
LANE,"Hey, you and Jess should come wi th us to the game tonight. It'll be fun.",3
RORY,"Yeah, I'm not sure what we're doing tonight.",3
ZACH,"""A mighty fortress is our God, a wall ten stories high. And he helps us when things getbad and the devil tries to hurt us.""",3
RORY,What hymn is that?,3
LANE,,3
TAYLORory,"If for some reason, you should get separated from the group, you'll find a map on the third page of your welcome packet.",3
DOUG,Why'd you draw your store so big?,3
TAYLORory,It just makes it easier to find if you get lost.,3
DOUG,It's bigger than the school. MAN 1: And why'd you put all those P's in soda shop? Is that supposed to fancy or something?,3
MICHELorelai,"You are in room twelve, and your father is   MAN 2: Are you from France?",3
MICHELorelai,Excuse me? MAN 2: You talk funny. You from France.,3
MICHELorelai,"Yes. So, as I was saying   MAN 2: I was in France during the Big One.",3
MICHELorelai,"Oh, that's nice. So - MAN 2: Nice? It was a w*r. What's nice about that?",3
MICHELorelai,"Of course. So, your father is   MAN 2: Don't give me that attitude, Frenchy. You'd be speaking German now if it wasn't for me.",3
LORELAI,Just make sure to have the vans back at 3:45 to take them to the game.,3
TAYLORory,"Oh, Lorelai, just a second. I wanted to  ",3
DOUG,"Hold on there, what is this?",3
TAYLORory,"That's the itinerary I've worked out for the afternoon. I thought Lorelai could post it in case some of the inn's other guests wanted to join us in our pre-game activities. Oh, Lorelai, this is my older brother Doug. Doug, this is Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,Hello.,3
DOUG,"Nice to meet you. Taylor, I told you on the phone, no one is gonna wanna do any of this crap. A tour of Stars Hollow? Most of us were born here. What do we need a tour for? Everyone, listen up. We're meet ing down here in two hours for the vans to the game. You're late, you'rewalking. Go back to your store and count peaches or something. I'm taking a nap.",3
EMILY,"Lorelai, hello.",3
LORELAI,Mom?,3
EMILY,"You rememb er, I'm so touched.",3
LORELAI,What are you doing here?,3
EMILY,"Well, I was thinking about possibly having our next DAR luncheon here.",3
LORELAI,Really?,3
EMILY,That's right. So I thought I would stop by and make sure the place is as charming as I rememb er. It is.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, well, what day would you like to have the meeting?",3
EMILY,The fifteenth.,3
LORELAI,"The fifteenth. Um, well, the fifteenth looks wide open, so you're officially down for the fifteenth.",3
EMILY,Wonderful.,3
LORELAI,Okay.,3
EMILY,Okay.,3
LORELAI,So.,3
EMILY,"So, how is Michel?",3
LORELAI,Michel's fine.,3
EMILY,"Well, good. I'm glad to hear it.",3
LORELAI,"Well, I'm glad to tell it. But Mom, I have this really big family reunion party that invaded the place today, so I should probably get back to work.",3
EMILY,"Oh, yes, you go right ahead. Do not let me keep you.",3
LORELAI,Okay. Mom?,3
EMILY,I'm not allowed to go home.,3
LORELAI,What?,3
EMILY,She's banished me from my own house,3
LORELAI,Gran?,3
EMILY,She's gone mad. This morning she announces that she's hosting a meeting of her bitter oldbiddies club at our house tonight and she needs the entire day to prepare because the house is in such a shambles.,3
LORELAI,"Nice, subtle.",3
EMILY,Then I was handed a list of chores and asked not to come home until at least six o'clock because I would simply be in the way.,3
LORELAI,"Mom, she's only staying with you for a few days.",3
EMILY,"I have to buy her flowers. She doesn't like mine, they're too tall. It's ostentatious to have flowers that tall.",3
LORELAI,"Actually, I've been meaning to mention that to you myself.",3
EMILY,I have to get new guest towels. I have to get new highball glasses. I have to get four very specific types of cheese. And I have to get a slide projector because they're going to view slides of potential acquisitions for the museum that they're on the board of.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, Mom  ",3
EMILY,"Of course, I haven't the faintest idea of where to find a slide projector. I feel like I'm going insane.",3
LORELAI,Mom.,3
EMILY,"I'm sorry. I think I'm just a little sensitive right now. It's selfish, I know, but Richard's traveling more than he ever did. He's been gone three of the last four weeks, and now he's finally home, and she's there comman ding all of his attention, all of his time. I sound like a spoiled high school girl.",3
LORELAI,Not quite. You still haven't asked for the Gloria Vanderbilt jeans and the convertible Rabbit.,3
EMILY,"Oh, never mind. I'm sorry I kept you from your work.",3
LORELAI,"Mom, listen, I have a slide projector. I'd be happy to bring it over tonight.",3
EMILY,"Oh, I really appreciate this, Lorelai. I mean it, I couldn't be more grateful.",3
LORELAI,Hold on.,3
EMILY,Where are you going?,3
LORELAI,I wanna get a tape recorder. I want that last thing on tape.,3
EMILY,Lorelai.,3

LANE,Hi. YOUNG,3
CHUI,Hi. These are for you.,3

SOOKIE,You want them where?,3

RORY,Hello?,3
LORELAI,Rory.,3
RORY,Mom?,3
LORELAI,What are you doing there?,3
RORY,"What do you mean, what am I doing here? I live here, remember? Who were you expecting to find?",3
LORELAI,No one. I was calling to check messages and see if Mom called.,3
RORY,"Well, she hasn't. No one has. In fact, this is the first time the phone's rung all day.",3
LORELAI,Ah.,3
RORY,"What, ah?",3
LORELAI,"Okay, get out.",3
RORY,Excuse me?,3
LORELAI,"Out of the house, get out of the house.",3
RORY,Why?,3
LORELAI,"Why? Look at the clock, what does it say?",3
RORY,It says six.,3
LORELAI,"So, it is six on a Saturday night, which means you have now spent a day and a night waiting for him to call.",3
RORY,I know.,3
LORELAI,"Well, that's not good, kid. Look, let's say he does call. You can't be the kind of girl that gets all mad in her head and then forgets everything once he deigns to show up, right?",3
RORY,Yeah.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, so don't just sit there waiting. Go out, do something.",3
RORY,Like what?,3
LORELAI,I don't know. What's Lane doing tonight?,3
RORY,She's going to the hockey game w ith her fake boyfriend.,3
LORELAI,Perfect.,3
RORY,Perfect? It's a hockey game.,3
LORELAI,"It'll be fun. There'll be cheerleaders and clowns, people doing the wave.",3
RORY,"You have no idea what a hockey game is, do you?",3
LORELAI,"It doesn't matter. Put on a jacket and get outta there, and if he calls . . .",3
RORY,Who cares!,3
LORELAI,That's my girl.,3
RORY,,3
EMILY,,3
PATTY,". . .And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air, gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. Oh say, does that star spangled banner yet wave, o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.",3
RORY,Hey.,3
LANE,Rory.,3
RORY,It's cold in here.,3
LANE,It's the ice.,3
RORY,"Oh my God, there really is ice. Cool.",3
LANE,What are you doing here?,3
RORY,I'm hockeying.,3
LANE,That's not a word.,3
RORY,Where is everybody?,3
LANE,"There was a monster truck show in Woodbury tonight, pulls a lot of the same demographic. Sit. Where's Jess?",3
RORY,"Don't know, don't care.",3
LANE,Really?,3
RORY,I'm a free woman tonight.,3
LANE,Is everything okay?,3
RORY,Everything's fine.,3
LANE,You sure?,3
RORY,Absolutely. I just wanted to see some good hockey playing.,3
LANE,Uh huh.,3
RORY,Really. Is that Young Chui?,3
LANE,"You mean the guy with the cell phone stapled to his ear   yeah, that's him.",3
RORY,He looks kind of serious.,3
LANE,He's talking to Karen.,3
RORY,His real girlfriend?,3
LANE,I think she's not quite as cool as Dave is about the whole fake dating thing. She needs reassurance.,3
RORY,"Well, Dave is pretty cool.",3
LANE,"The coolest, isn't it? I mean, besides Jess.",3
RORY,Right.,3
LANE,Right.,3
KIRK,"People of Stars Hollow, are you ready to rumble? Then let's get it on.",3

BRIAN,Was she looking at me?,3
ZACH,"She wasn't looking at me, dude.",3
DAVE,"Hey, I'm gonna, uh, go outside and get some air, okay?",3
ZACH,"Uh, sure.",3
DAVE,,3
LANE,"Believe me, I am not interested in Young Chui in that way. He's cute and all, but I've got a guy. No, no, when I say he's cute, I just mean he's your boyfriend and you've got good taste, that's all. Hey, Koreans do not have problems! You talk to her, I'm done. YOUNG",3
CHUI,Karen?,3
RORY,That went well.,3
LINDSAY,Oh.,3
RORY,"Hey Lindsay, how are you?",3
LANE,Hi Lindsay.,3
LINDSAY,"Hi. I'm good, thanks. Um, how are you?",3
RORY,"Good. You know, just enjoying my first hockey game. It seems there's a lot of bashing of people into walls, which is always good fun in my book.",3
LINDSAY,"Oh, absolutely. I'm all for more bashing.",3
RORY,"You know, I don't think we've seen each other since I left Stars Hollow High. What have you been up to?",3
LINDSAY,"Oh, you know, nothing really. The usual, school.",3
RORY,"Right, sure.",3
LANE,"School. Me too, but you know that since we go to school together.",3
LINDSAY,"Well, I should be getting back. Um, it was good seeing you again.",3
RORY,"You, too.",3
LANE,Bye.,3
RORY,"Okay, so that was weird, right?",3
LANE,"Oh, yeah, really weird.",3
RORY,"But I didn't do anything, did I?",3
LANE,"You mean like ask her how she was? Yeah, you probably made an enemy for life.",3
RORY,"Maybe she's angry because I didn't keep in touch after I left, but we weren't that good of friends.",3
LANE,"Maybe, or it could be that Chilton thing.",3
RORY,What Chilton thing?,3
LANE,"Well, you know how some people think because you went to Chilton, you're a snob and think you're better than everyone else.",3
RORY,What? Who thinks that?,3
LANE,"Well, you know, like uh, Julie Lersten, Kristin Keiffer, Jill Allen. Haven't we talked about this?",3
RORY,No.,3
DAVE,Hey.,3
LANE,Dave.,3
DAVE,Hey Rory.,3
RORY,Hey.,3
DAVE,"So, where's, uh, where's Young Chui?",3
LANE,Talking to Karen.,3
DAVE,Who?,3
RORY,His girlfriend.,3
DAVE,"Oh, right. That's cool, okay. Well, how's the game?",3
LANE,The other team's winning.,3
RORY,"But our fans have the best insults. At least, Babette does.",3
DAVE,"Well, that's really what counts in the end.",3
LANE,"So, what are you doing here? Did you finish already?",3
DAVE,"Oh, no. You're mom gave us a fifteen minute break. I just thought I'd swing by.",3
LANE,But it's more than a mile away.,3
DAVE,"Yeah, I better get back. I'll see you later.",3
LANE,Bye.,3
RORY,"Well, well, well. If I didn't know better, I'd say someone isn't quite as cool as we thought he was.",3
LANE,"What do you mean? He's jealous. Oh my God, he's jealous, that's so great.",3
RORY,"You've worked your womanly wiles on him, Lane Kim.",3
LANE,I've never made a guy jealous before. I feel so powerful.,3
RORY,"Just rememb er, there's cute jealous and there's Othello.",3
LANE,Good point.,3
RORY,,3
LORELAI,Jess.,3
JESS,"Hey, is Rory here?",3
LORELAI,Are you serious?,3
JESS,"Yeah, I'm serious.",3
LORELAI,"No, I'm serious. Are you serious?",3
JESS,Why do you keep asking me if I'm serious?,3
LORELAI,"Because I'm just trying to imagine the scenario here. You looked at the clock that said it was 7:30 on a Saturday night and you thought to yourself, ""Hey, Rory must be home.""",3
JESS,Yes.,3
LORELAI,"I'm sorry, are you serious?",3
JESS,"Okay, I'm guessing that's your way of telling me she's not home.",3
LORELAI,"No, Jess, she's not home.",3
JESS,Do you know where she is?,3
LORELAI,She's at the hockey game.,3
JESS,"Hey, look, you don't wanna tell me where she is, fine.",3
LORELAI,"Jess, she really is at the hockey game. You'd know that if you'd   what, ladies and gentlemen? That's right   bothered to call.",3
JESS,Why are you hassling me?,3
LORELAI,"Well, mostly because I'm here to hassle you. Now, if you'd bothered calling, maybe Rory would be here to hassle you.",3
JESS,"Hey, Rory knows I'm not the kind of guy who lives by a schedule.",3
LORELAI,"Yes, and look what the guy who doesn't live by a schedule ends up doing on a Saturday night   talking to his girlfriend's mother.",3
JESS,Whatever.,3
LORELAI,"Hey, Jess. You like music, right? The Beach Boys said it best. None of the guys go steady  cause it wouldn't be right to leave their best girls home on a Saturday night. Rory is one of the best girls. She's the best girl, if you want my opinion, and you don't seem to have the first idea as to how she should be treated.",3
JESS,"Well, luckily I've got you to tell me.",3
LORELAI,Not anymore. You and I have discussed your relationship with Rory long enough.,3
JESS,Fine.,3
LORELAI,I'll tell her you stopped by.,3
JESS,Don't bother.,3
LORELAI,,3
RORY,"If I had known sports were so much about eating, I would've come to a lot more of these.",3
LANE,I know. There's something deeply satisfying about watching other people exercise while eating junk food.,3
KIRK,"Ten minutes  til the next period, ladies and gentlemen. That's what we call them in hockey   periods, not halves. Let's try to keep that straight. Also, the puck is never referred to as a ball, not according to the book. Again, my bad.",3
LANE,,3
KIRK,"Number twelve has it now. He's skating, he's skating. My bet is he's going to try to whack it into that net thingy, but that's conjecture at this point. Now it's going the other way and they're hitting it between them. Number seven has it. Now number three. Now seven. Three again. Seven. Ten's got it now.",3
DEAN,"Kirk, just to let you know, some of the guys   not me, you know   but some of the guys say they're gonna rip your head off if you don't shut up, okay?",3
KIRK,We'll be pausing for a short break.,3
CROWD,"We've got spirit, yes we do! We've got spirit, how about you?",3
LANE,You sure you're okay?,3
RORY,"Will you stop asking me that every five seconds? I'm fine. I mean, it had to happen sometime. I didn't expect him to just sit around pining for me. Okay, a little, but she's really nice, right?",3
LANE,This is all my fault.,3
RORY,Lane.,3
LANE,"I let you down. I'm supposed to be your eyes and ears in that school, and here's the biggest piece of news all year and I had no idea.",3
RORY,It's okay.,3
LANE,"No, it's not. This is an intelligence gaffe of monumental proportions. What was I doing that I didn't notice this?",3
RORY,"Studying, taking classes.",3
LANE,"Well, no more.",3
RORY,"Lane, it's not a big deal, really. And now I know, so, case closed.",3
LANE,You're sure?,3
RORY,Positive. Let's just enjoy the game.,3
PLAYERory,No way!,3
KIRK,,3
LORELAI,Hi. Just came to drop off some things.,3
MAID,"Oh, I can take those.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, great, thanks. Careful, it's heavy.",3
MAID,Everyone's in the living room if you wanna go in.,3
LORELAI,"Uh, if I wanna go in, if I wanna go in. Well, you pose a very deep and philosophical question there, but I think I'll just  ",3
EMILY,Lorelai. I thought I heard your voice.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, I brought the slide machine and the platters and the punch bowl.",3
EMILY,"Wonderful. Come in and meet everyone, won't you?",3
LORELAI,,3
WYCK,It's obscene.,3
TRIX,,3
WYCK,Then Picasso is obscene.,3
TRIX,,3
WYCK,It has six breasts.,3
TRIX,You cannot be sure if those are breasts. They could be canons. He was quite obsessed with the Spanish Civil w*r for awhile.,3
EMILY,"Ladies, look who's here.",3
TRIX,"Lorelai, wonderful. We all need a break for a moment. Come meet my friends. Emily, we were waiting for iced tea or am I imagining things?",3
EMILY,"It's on its way, Mom.",3
TRIX,"So is death. Lorelai, this is Mrs. Van Wyck, Mrs. Deerborne, Mrs. Rutherman. This is my granddaughter, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,Nice to meet you all.,3
TRIX,"Well, come, sit.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, I don't want to interrupt anything.",3
TRIX,"You're interrupting nothing but thirst, my dear. Now, talk to some old women, tell us what it's like to be young.",3
LORELAI,"Not nearly as much fun since the mandatory sunscreen rule, I'll tell ya.",3
EMILY,"Here we go, iced tea and sandwiches.",3
TRIX,Too warm. Do you know that Lorelai's daughter is graduating from Chilton in June?,3
EMILY,Love in the afternoon. . .,3
TRIX,She is an excellent student and may. . .,3
EMILY,"La, la, la, la, la. . .",3
TRIX,"Emily, what are you doing?",3
EMILY,I'm sorry?,3
TRIX,Why are you singing like that?,3
EMILY,"Was I signing? I didn't realize. Here's your tea, Mom. I certainly hope it's cold enough.",3
LORELAI,"Um, I brought the slide projector over. Would you like me to set it up?",3
TRIX,That would be fine. We can start watching now since I do not anticipate dinner being served anywhere near the time I requested.,3
EMILY,Our hearts are filled with joy. . .,3
TRIX,Emily you're doing it again.,3
EMILY,I was?,3
TRIX,"Yes, you were.",3
EMILY,"Huh. You know, it's because I caught some of ""Love in the Afternoon"" the other day, the movie. Have you seen it, Mom?",3
TRIX,I don't believe I have.,3
EMILY,"Oh, well, it's wonderful. And a wonderful concept, too, don't you think? Anyway, I must have the music stuck in my head. That must be why I'm singing it. I mean, what else could it be, hm?",3
LORELAI,"Hey, Mom, how  bout we go get some of that cheese you bought for the ladies, huh? I'll help you. Come on. We'll be right back.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, what is going on?",3
EMILY,I saw her kissing a man.,3
LORELAI,What?,3
EMILY,"When I came home today, I walked in and I saw her standing in the living room kissing a man.",3
LORELAI,Gran?,3
EMILY,Yes.,3
LORELAI,My Gran?,3
EMILY,Yes.,3
LORELAI,My Gran was kissing a man?,3
EMILY,In a purple velour jogging suit.,3
LORELAI,Gran was in a purple velour jogging suit?,3
EMILY,"No, the man was wearing a purple jogging suit.",3
LORELAI,And you're sure they were kissing?,3
EMILY,One hundred percent sure.,3
LORELAI,My God. Was he hot?,3
EMILY,Excuse me?,3
LORELAI,"Well, I don't know what you're supposed to ask when you hear your grandmother's been making out with a guy.",3
EMILY,I don't know if he was hot. Your grandmother sucking face was blocking my view.,3
LORELAI,What'd she do? Did she see you?,3
EMILY,"No. After my heart started back up again, I went outside and hid in the bushes until he left.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, now I have two really good visuals fighting for top billing here.",3
EMILY,Do you realize how wonderful this is?,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, I guess it's wonderful, Gran has a guy.",3
EMILY,"No, what's wonderful is after all these years of her abuse, her condescension, her insults and her degrading commen ts, after all these years of pure unadulterated hell, I finally have something to hold over her.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, Mom.",3
EMILY,"Finally, I have the upper hand. Finally, I have something to nail her with. Finally, that woman is going down.",3
LORELAI,You cannot use this against Gran.,3
EMILY,"Yes, I can, I've earned it.",3
LORELAI,"Mom, I know Gran gives you a hard time, but she did not tell anyone about this guy for a reason.",3
EMILY,"Yes, because she's embarrassed. She should be. He was dressed like a bookie.",3
LORELAI,You have to be above this.,3
EMILY,"No, I don't have to be above this.",3
LORELAI,"You're seriously telling me that you're gonna be the one to go out there and humiliate Gran in front of her friends, in front of her family. Just think about it, Mom. What would Miss Manners do?",3
EMILY,It's not fair.,3
LORELAI,Gran will be back in her own house soon.,3
EMILY,"I know, you're right.",3
LORELAI,Just hang on  til then.,3
EMILY,"All right, let's go back in there and get this evening over with.",3
LORELAI,"You're a stand up lady, Emily Gilmore, you know that?",3
EMILY,,3
WYCK,"And is this normal, Richard, to be getting home from work so late?",3
RICHARD,"Oh, that's one of the pitfalls of starting your own business, I'm afraid.",3
TRIX,"You should say, of starting a successful business, Richard.",3
RICHARD,"Successful so far, Trix. Let's not jinx it.",3
TRIX,"Though, perhaps if Emily could have the meal served on time, Richard would have more inducement to get home at a reasonable hour.",3
EMILY,I saw her kissing a man in a track suit!,3
RICHARD,What?,3
TRIX,,3
KIRK,"Well, ladies and gentlemen, much like the Israelites of Yore, the Stars Hollow Minutemen languished in the desert for forty years. But tonight, there was no Promised Land, no New Canaan, only a humiliating five to one defeat at the merciless hands of the West Hartford Wildcats. So it's back to the desert for the Minutemen, perhaps for another forty years. Of course, by then, I'll be seventy years old. A lot of the rest of you will probably be dead. Taylor, you'll be dead. Babette, Miss Patty. . .that man there in the hat.",3
LANE,"Hey, if we run, we might be able to catch the last few minutes of the band.",3
RORY,"Yeah, I don't think the pint of liquid cheese in my stomach is going to allow for much running.",3
LANE,I'll call you tomorrow.,3
RORY,Definitely. Have fun. YOUNG,3
CHUI,Bye.,3
RORY,Bye.,3
DEAN,Hey.,3
RORY,"Dean. Hey, how are you? Oh, God, that's a stupid question to ask someone who just lost the regional semi-finals, isn't it? And now it sounds like I'm rubbing your face in it.",3
DEAN,"Don't worry about it. They were better than us, they deserved to win.",3
RORY,"And hey, at least you got a point. That's good, right? I mean, better than not getting any. Geez, I really suck at this post-sports talk.",3
DEAN,"Well, you haven't had much practice.",3
RORY,"True. But who knows, I might be a sports convert. I mean, the eating of massive amounts ofjunk food, and listening to Kirk make a fool of himself in front of a bunch of people   all things I enjoy.",3
DEAN,"In fact, you could almost get rid of the sports part of it.",3
RORY,"That's what I was going to say. So, I ran into Lindsay.",3
DEAN,"Yeah, I hadn't quite figured out how to tell you that.",3
RORY,"Well, I think it's great.",3
DEAN,You do?,3
RORY,"Absolutely. I mean, she's cute and smart and really nice.",3
DEAN,I know.,3
RORY,"Like once, in fourth grade, we went on a field trip to Mark Twain's house, and I really wanted this refrigerator magnet in the shape of Mark Twain's head, but I didn't have any money, so she bought it for me, and she wouldn't even let me pay her back. Pretty classy for a fourth grader.",3
DEAN,That sounds like Lindsay.,3
RORY,"Exactly. So, good job, mister.",3
DEAN,"Thanks. So, how are things with Jess?",3
RORY,"Oh, good, good.",3
DEAN,He's not with you?,3
RORY,No. This really isn't his kind of thing.,3
DEAN,"Yeah. Well, uh, I'd better go. I gotta change and then Lindsay and I are going out.",3
RORY,Right. Sure. Have fun.,3
LUKE,"You've reached Luke Danes and Jess Mariano, leave a message.",3
RORY,"It's me. I just wanted to let you know that this is the last weekend I spend sitting around like an idiot hoping you'll call, okay? I'm not going to be that girl. From now on, I want a plan. I mean, a real plan with a time an d a place, and I'm tired of hearing  Let's hook up later.' What does that mean anyway? What's later? How do I set my watch to later? Later doesn't cut it anymore, got it? And, yeah, you know, maybe I am spoiled. But guess what? I like being spoiled. I plan to go on being spoiled. And if that doesn't sound like something that you can or want to do, then fine. I'm sure you'll find another girl who doesn't mind sitting around cleaning her keyboard on a Friday night hoping you'll call, but it's not going to be me. Oh, yeah, this is a message for Jess.",3
JESS,"Hey. Figured I'd find you here. I mean, you say the word hockey, you say the word Rory, right?",3
RORY,What are you doing here?,3
JESS,Came to give you these.,3
RORY,Earplugs. What are these for?,3
JESS,I got tickets to the Distillers.,3
RORY,You did? For when?,3
JESS,For tonight.,3
RORY,Tonight? But  ,3
JESS,"I would've been here sooner, but I had to wait in line. So we should probably get going. I mean, we don't wanna miss anything, right?",3
RORY,"Hey, Jess?",3
JESS,Yeah?,3
RORY,,3
GRAN,Come in .,3
EMILY,I brought you some as pirin. It's the buffered kind that you like. Is there anything else that you need?,3
GRAN,"No, thank you.",3
EMILY,"Mom, I want to apologize for what I said downstairs. I had no right to humiliate you like that, in front of your friends, in front of Richard. This relationship was something you had chosen to keep private and I should have respected that. I am truly sorry. He seemed like a very nice man. Why didn't you tell anyone about him?",3
GRAN,"I married once, I married Richard's father. That was my husband. I have no desire to marry again and dishonor his memo ry.",3
EMILY,I understand.,3
GRAN,"I believe a woman marries for life. If, after your husband is gone, you desperately desire some sort of permanent attachment, add an addition onto the house   a library or a solarium. I have a library and a solarium.",3
EMILY,"Yes, you do.",3
GRAN,"However, in spite of all this, I found myself getting lonely. And I don't care for being lonely, it's quite annoying. So many years ago, I met a man, and he became my companion. Tonight, both he and I were both publicly humiliated and our relationship altered forever. Can you imagine how that feels?",3
EMILY,"Actually, I've had a little experience with being humiliated in front of the people I love, yes. Mom, please believe me, I know how important your pride is to you, and I never had any intention of robbing you of it. I feel terrible that I caused you any pain. I just wish that once in awhile, you might feel a little bit terrible that you cause me pain. I have pride, too, you know. And my husband travels and is very busy and I miss him and I'm lonely sometimes, just like you.",3
GRAN,,3
LORELAI,So that was quite a gathering.,3
RICHARD,"Yes, it was.",3
LORELAI,"It would make a great Christmas story. I mean, I know it didn't happen at Christmas, but it's the kind of thing that would happen at Christmas, so it's not like if you told someone it did happen at Christmas, they'd go,  Really?  Cause it doesn't sound like a Christmas story.' Thanksgiving would probably work also. Listen, Dad, I know you're a little upset with Mom right now, and I'm probably out of line in saying this, but you might wanna think about cutting her some slack. She's really missed you lately. I mean, you work so much and then you're helping Gran in your free time, which is totally understandable, but still, it's hard. As much as Gran likes you, she tends to be a littler rough on Mom, and I think Mom just kind of snapped. She'd never do anything like that intentionally. You do know that, Dad, right?",3
LORELAI,"Dad? Okay, apparently it's two-for-one flip out night at the Gilmore house.",3
RICHARD,Do you really think he was wearing a track suit?,3
LORELAI,I don't. . .,3
RICHARD,"Well, I wonder if he was wearing Nike's also.",3
LORELAI,"Just Do It takes on a whole new meaning, doesn't it?",3
RICHARD,I guess I've got a new daddy.,3
LORELAI,Maybe he'll take you to ball games.,3
RICHARD,"Oh, we could get matching jogging suits. Oh, if only I could've seen Emily hiding in the bushes. It's like a play by Moliere.",3
EMILY,What are you two cackling about?,3
RICHARD,"Oh, nothing.",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, nothing.",3
EMILY,"Well, don't stop on my account. I'm just passing through.",3
RICHARD,Where are you going?,3
EMILY,We're going to have tea.,3
LORELAI,They're going to have tea?,3
RICHARD,That's a first.,3
LORELAI,Maybe they're going to be pals now.,3
RICHARD,I don't know how I feel about my mother and my wife being in cahoots.,3
LORELAI,I don't know how I feel about you saying the word cahoots.,3
RICHARD,"Well, this alliance could make things very uncomfortable for me.",3
EMILY,"Sending a maid down to tell me how to make tea, as if I don't know after all these years. Guess she'll have a coronary if the water hits the cup one second before the bag.",3
LORELAI,I think you're safe.,3
RICHARD,,3
LORELAI,"Hey, how was the game?",3
RORY,"Fun, we got clobbered.",3
LORELAI,"Oh. If you'd won, you could've rioted through town trashing storefronts and torching police cars like they do in L.A.",3
RORY,Maybe next year.,3
LORELAI,What'd you do after?,3
RORY,"Oh, you know, just hung out.",3
LORELAI,With Lane and her fake boyfriend?,3
RORY,Uh huh. I thought you were eating at Grandma's.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, yes, and there's a story behind that.",3
RORY,Can it wait  til tomorrow? I'm really exhausted.,3
LORELAI,It's a good story.,3
RORY,I'm sure. I just won't be able to fully appreciate it in my weakened state. And this gives you extra time to practice your voices.,3
LORELAI,,3
RORY,Jogging suit.,3
LORELAI,"See, you're hooked.",3
RORY,"Yeah, well, now I'm definitely waking up tomorrow.",3
LORELAI,Night honey.,3

LORELAI,Mail!,3
RORY,Mail!,3
LORELAI,Hurry up! Where are your shoes?,3
RORY,I'll get them later.,3
LORELAI,"No, get them now.",3
RORY,Why?,3
LORELAI,"Why? Because if your Harvard acceptance letter is in that batch of mail and you do not have shoes on, we can't run off immed iately and celebrate. All of our happiness will be on hold until you come back inside and put on your shoes. Is that what you want to put a hold on happiness?",3
RORY,What's the difference if we wait then or we wait now?,3
LORELAI,Because we are not happy now.,3
RORY,"Right, okay.",3
LORELAI,"No laces, just get them on your feet.",3
RORY,Let's go!,3
LORELAI,Kirk!,3
RORY,Kirk!,3
KIRK,"Good morning, ladies.",3
Posted,03/08/03 22:46,3
LORELAI,Is there an envelope in there?,3
RORY,"A big envelope, not a little envelope.",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, a big envelope means she's in, a little envelope means she needs to marry rich.",3
KIRK,"Just one second, please.",3
RORY,Aren't you supposed to go through the mail before you get here?,3
KIRK,"Some w ork that way. Personally, I think it takes the spontaneity out of the job.",3
LORELAI,Need some help?,3
KIRK,"Sorry, federal law prohibits it.",3
RORY,Any chance you could go faster?,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, you got a girl's future in that sack of yours, Santa.",3
RORY,Thank you for adding the Santa.,3
LORELAI,Any time.,3
KIRK,You know what I've noticed?,3
LORELAI,"It wouldn't be any mail in there with our names on it, would it?",3
KIRK,I've noticed people don't slow down anymore.,3
RORY,Guess I've got time to tie my shoes.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, well, cobble yourself a new pair Daniel Day Lewis.",3
KIRK,No one stops to smell a nice flower or look at a puppy.,3
LORELAI,You're absolutely right.,3
KIRK,"No one stops to ask how you're doing. . .is your family well, did you see that game last night?",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, yeah, people suck. Is that ours?",3
KIRK,What? Oh. Mrs. Rita Flora. Nope.,3
RORY,Rats.,3
LORELAI,It could still be in there.,3
KIRK,Rita Flora   didn't she die?,3
LORELAI,While you were delivering her mail?,3
KIRK,She did die. She died last week.,3
LORELAI,Kirk.,3
KIRK,They're supposed to put your mail on hold when you die.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, let's go back inside.",3
RORY,What about the envelope?,3
LORELAI,We'll check back on our way to Luke's. . .for dinner.,3
KIRK,,3
LANE,"It's getting frustrating. I mean, there's so many great songs that have been written post- Cobain, but try and convince Zach of that. I mean, he's impossible, stubborn, and just a tad intellectually challenged, in case you haven't noticed.",3
LORELAI,"Lane, honey?",3
LANE,Yeah?,3
LORELAI,"Just, could you, with the sticks there, I can't. . .",3
LANE,"Oh, sorry. Nervous habit.",3
RORY,Mom's a little crabby this morning.,3
LORELAI,"I'm not crabby, I'm very, very ill.",3
RORY,With allergies.,3
LORELAI,Deadly allergies.,3
RORY,"Sorry, didn't mean to minimize your condition. Should we make funeral arrangements now?",3
LORELAI,Yes. But make sure you can get your money back in case this stuff works.,3
RORY,Where did you get those?,3
LORELAI,Found them in your room.,3
RORY,These expired in  98.,3
LORELAI,"So, what, I should take four?",3
RORY,"Yes, that's exactly my point.",3
LUKE,Here.,3
RORY,New menus.,3
LANE,Very fancy.,3
LORELAI,Why'd you get new menus?,3
LUKE,It was time.,3
LORELAI,But I had made little doodles with my name hidden in them on each one of the old ones just like Hirschfeld.,3
LUKE,Sorry.,3
LORELAI,It took me years to hit every menu. And these have super heavy plastic over them. How am I gonna doodle?,3
LUKE,Has it ever occurred to you that the super heavy plastic is there to discourage the doodling?,3
RORY,"Hey, this looks different.",3
LUKE,It's not different.,3
LANE,It's totally different.,3
LUKE,It's not that different.,3
LORELAI,There are more salads.,3
RORY,Three more salads.,3
LORELAI,Three more salads   who needs three more salads?,3
RORY,One was enough.,3
LUKE,"Well, Nicole said  ",3
LORELAI,Nicole said.,3
LUKE,"There wasn't really that much for her to eat on the menu, so I just. . .",3
LORELAI,"Oh, you added three more salads just for Nicole. When I asked you to add chili-topped Pringles, you said no.",3
LUKE,And I stand by that.,3
LORELAI,How come N icole gets three salads and I still get a no?,3
RORY,Because Nicole is his girlfriend.,3
LUKE,"Nicole is not my girlfriend, Nicole is the woman that I am dating, that's it.",3
LORELAI,"So what happens when you guys get serious, the whole place goes soy?",3
LUKE,"Just order, please.",3
LANE,Did you take off the Monte Cristo sandwich?,3
LUKE,"Well, I  ",3
RORY,No!,3
LORELAI,"You did, you took off the Monte Cristo sandwich.",3
LUKE,I omitted a few obsolete dishes.,3
LORELAI,I can't believe Nicole made you take off the Monte Cristo. She's got you menu-whipped.,3
LUKE,"She does not have me men u-whipped. I took off a disgusting ridiculous sandwich that no one has ever ordered, including the three of you.",3
RORY,But just having it there made us feel like we always could.,3
LORELAI,It was comforting.,3
RORY,Like soup.,3
LORELAI,Exactly. It was comforting like deep-fried ham and cheese soup.,3
RORY,"And even though I never ordered it, I talked about ordering it, haven't I?",3
LANE,On several occasions.,3
LORELAI,"So you've not only eliminated a sandwich, you've eliminated a conversation piece.",3
RORY,Now what will we talk about?,3
LUKE,Fine.,3
LUKE,"Here. Old menus, everything's there. Knock yourselves out.",3
LORELAI,,3
TEACHERory,"Well, I must say I'm glad to see that simply because the SATs are over, most of you are still taking your classwork seriously. Most of you.",3
LOUISE,Michael Mason. Worth every wrong answer.,3
TEACHERory,"All right, before we continue, I would like to remind you that the Chilton Bicentennial celebration takes place next week.",3
LOUISE,Number four.,3
MADELINE,Well done.,3
TEACHERory,"The official sign up sheet for the speech contest has gone up in the back of the room.The contest will be held on Friday, and the winner will present their speech at the ceremony next week. Now, some of you may be saying to yourself,  Hey, I already turned in my college application. Why should I spend all this time entering a speech competition, which if I win means I have to give up a Friday night, when I can't even use it for my resume? What's in it for me?'",3
MADELINE,"Wow, that was spooky.",3
TEACHERory,"Yes, the speech will not go on your record. However, the bicentennial is going to be quite a prestigious affair. Past alumni and faculty will be there, some of these people are now professors at the same schools you're planning an attending. Plus, C-SPAN will be broadcasting the event live. All in all, it's shaping up to be a very exciting event. Think about it. Oh, I almost forgot to welcome back Brad Langford. He returns to us fresh from Broadway where he's just completed a successful run of Into the Woods. Welcome back, Brad.",3
BRAD,Thank you. It's good to be back.,3
PARIS,"Sit down, Mary Martin.",3
TEACHERory,"All right everyone, have a lovely rest of the day. I will see you tomorrow.",3
BRAD,"Rory, hi.",3
RORY,"Hey Brad, good to have you back. How was Broadway?",3
BRAD,"It was great, but Nathan Lane is a very bitter man.",3
RORY,I've heard that.,3
BRAD,"You know, I tell you, even more than the actual experience of performing live, the confidence it gives you in every aspect of your life, that's the most amazing thing.",3
RORY,"Well, you do look rather confident.",3
BRAD,"Hey, it's the new me.",3
LOUISE,"So, Brad. . .Broadway, I must know.",3
BRAD,Yes?,3
LOUISE,Did you get to keep your makeup?,3
MADELINE,"What about your costumes,  cause that seems great.",3
LOUISE,"Ooh, unless you're doing Les Mis.",3
MADELINE,Or Cats.,3
LOUISE,Furry spandex with a tail and jazz shoes?,3
MADELINE,"Hurrah. So, do you?",3
BRAD,Do I?,3
MADELINE,Get to keep the makeup?,3
BRAD,I didn't ask.,3
LOUISE,You didn't ask?,3
MADELINE,How do you leave the house every morning and not have a piano fall on your head?,3
BRAD,"Well, I make a left on Federal and then  ",3
RORY,"Brad, that really didn't require an answer.",3
PARIS,You're blocking the list.,3
RORY,"What's that? Will we please move so you may sign up for the speech contest? Why, yes, Paris, we'd be happy to. How kind of you to phrase it in that very respectful manner.",3
PARIS,"Are you going to move, or do you need a five, six, seven, eight?",3
BRAD,"Paris, this time on stage has been a very growing experience for me. I'm no longer intimidated by you or people like you.",3
PARIS,"I'm thrilled to hear it, Chita Rivera. Move. Well, Gilmore, I certainly hope you're signing up, too. It'll be my last chance to trounce you with anything at this school.",3
RORY,"My decision to do this will in no way depend on you, Paris.",3
PARIS,I'm only saying it won't be a totally satisfying victory just beating Jerome Robbins and the rest of the losers here. I'd really like to take you down also.,3
BRAD,,3
SOOKIE,"This is outrageous. I am beyond offended. Did you tell them I'm beyond offended? Sending my food back? That's it, get their names, they're never eating here again.",3
WAITERory,Okay.,3
SOOKIE,"Wait, what wine was he drinking?",3
WAITERory,1952 Chateau Petrus Bordeaux.,3
SOOKIE,"Hm. Okay, never mind.",3
LORELAI,"Hey, is everything okay?",3
SOOKIE,"No, we have got to have a better screening system for customers here.",3
LORELAI,"Yes, we do, since we currently have no screening system for customers here.",3
SOOKIE,"They sent it back. My food. My four star,  you haven't lived  til you've eaten there, says Ruth Reichl,' food.",3
LORELAI,What did they say was wrong?,3
SOOKIE,"You name it . Too salty, too hot, too sewer-y.",3
LORELAI,"Honey, calm down. Some people are just stupid.",3
SOOKIE,"Yes, they are stupid, and stupid people have stupid friends, and they all have to come here and be stupid together.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, now, don't be mad at me, but I have to ask this   are you sure there's nothing wrong with the food?",3
SOOKIE,"Of course there's nothing wrong with the food. You don't think that I would know if something was wrong with my food? You don't think that I tasted every last dish that was sent back. I tasted it, Manuel tasted it, Rico tasted it, Louella tasted it. We all tasted it and it tastes fine.",3
LORELAI,Okay. Do you mind?,3
SOOKIE,You don't believe me?,3
LORELAI,"I believe you completely, but it's easier for me to take on those who doubt you if I actually tasted it myself.",3
SOOKIE,"Fine, go ahead.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, now I get the sewer-y reference.",3
SOOKIE,What are you talking about?,3
LORELAI,"Come here. Just, uh, send them out some free desserts.",3
SOOKIE,Free desserts? You're giving the stupid people free desserts.,3
LORELAI,"Sookie, I love you.",3
SOOKIE,"I love you, too.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, and I love your food, you know that.",3
SOOKIE,Yeah.,3
LORELAI,"But I have to tell you that that bite I just had over there is one of the worst things I've ever tasted, and I've tasted some very bad things.",3
SOOKIE,What?,3
LORELAI,"Are you sure you didn't just accidentally drop something in the food tonight, like, I don't know, uh, strychnine or manure?",3
SOOKIE,"No, I tested each dish every step of the way. I mean, the base, the stock, the sauce, the seasonings.",3
LORELAI,Are you sick?  Cause sometimes the flu or a cold or even allergies can throw your tastebuds off.,3
SOOKIE,"No, I'm not sick. I mean, I had a little bug last week, but nothing today.",3
LORELAI,"Well, I think you should think about getting a checkup. Maybe it was more than a little bug.",3
SOOKIE,The food was really bad?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, honey, it was just. . .well, yeah, it was really that bad.",3
SOOKIE,I don't understand it.,3
LORELAI,"Ah, I'm sure it was nothing. Just have Manuel help you with the tasting for the rest of the night, okay?",3
RORY,"Paris is going to drive me completely insane. Ooh, that looks good. ENTIRE KITCHEN",3
STAFF,No!,3
RORY,Geez.,3
LORELAI,"Be happy you're loved, hon. I got a Kit Kat in my purse.",3
RORY,What's up?,3
LORELAI,"I don't know. It's weird, Sookie must be sick or something.",3
RORY,Sookie never gets sick.,3
LORELAI,"She'll be fine. So, tell me, what did Paris do now?",3
RORY,"It's nothing, it's just Paris. There's this speech contest for the bicentennial, and I wasn't even going to enter it, but I don't know   with the whole  it's my last chance to crush you before graduation' commen t, I want to enter, I want to win, and I wanna dance around her saying  I win, I win, I win!'",3
LORELAI,"Wow, you're getting more and more like me everyday.",3
RORY,"But I know, it was petty and stupid and I should probably just ignore her.",3
LORELAI,"Yes, that is what you should do.",3
RORY,"Okay, that is what I will do.",3
LORELAI,How come you weren't gonna enter the contest?,3
RORY,I don't know.,3
LORELAI,You love doing school things.,3
RORY,I don't love doing school things when it involves the entire school staring at me while I'm doing them.,3
LORELAI,You had to give your vice presidential acceptance speech in front of the entire school.,3
RORY,"Yeah, but I had to do that.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, so you're just gonna go through life only doing what you have to do.",3
RORY,"Well, no.",3
LORELAI,Because a person who wants to be a foreign correspondent for a living should probably embrace the opportunity to practice her speechin' skills in front of a crowd.,3
RORY,You had the motherly edge going there until you threw in the speechin' skills comment.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, well, you know what I mean.",3
RORY,"I know what you mean. Okay, I'll go out for the speech.",3
LORELAI,Good.,3
RORY,"And if I get to do the  I win, I win, I win' dance, then so much the better.",3
LORELAI,For everyone involved.,3
RORY,Mmhmm.,3
LORELAI,Oh my God. Oh my God.,3
LORELAI,You're pregnant!,3
SOOKIE,I'm pregnant!,3
SOOKIE,"Oh my God, I'm pregnant!",3
RORY,You're pregnant?,3
SOOKIE,I'm pregnant!,3
LORELAI,That's why!,3
SOOKIE,I'm pregnant!,3
RORY,,3
PARIS,Huh.,3
GIRLorelai,What?,3
PARIS,"That just looks like more than four thousand words, but I'm sure you counted them.",3
GIRLorelai,I did.,3
PARIS,"Good. Hey Shelly, good luck. Although I'm sure you're going to be great. After all, there's hardly anything on stage for you to trip over this time, right? I've got my beans at Grandma's house, my magic beans at Grandma's house.",3
BRAD,Stop it.,3
PARIS,"I'll take my beans, my magic beans, who's got the beans, we need some beans, I love the beans.",3
BRAD,You can't rattle me.,3
PARIS,Into the woods at Grandma's house.,3
BRAD,"Look, I'm proud of my part, okay? The New York Times called me winningly naïve.",3
PARIS,"Into the woods, into the woods, into the woods.",3
RORY,Stop it right now.,3
PARIS,"I know, that is one annoying song.",3
RORY,"Leave Brad alone, and stop terrorizing everyone in this hallway.",3
PARIS,"Terrorizing? What are you talking about, terrorizing? I'm simply talking to my fellow classmates.",3
RORY,You're trying to scare them into doing badly so you'll win easier.,3
PARIS,I am not.,3
RORY,Oh really? And that magical bean recital back there?,3
PARIS,"Hey, I was trying to give the kid some human contact. He's been talking to nothing but a cow for a year and a half.",3
BRAD,"There was a person inside that cow, I've told you that!",3
TEACHERory,Brad Langford.,3
BRAD,I'm winningly naïve.,3
TEACHERory,Okay.,3
PARIS,"Brad, you got your beans?",3
RORY,"Stop. Go Brad, you'll do great.",3
RORY,"It's amazing how you manage to hide those bolts on the side of your neck. What is that, just really good cover up?",3
PARIS,"Rory, lower your voice. People are trying to concentrate.",3
RORY,Wow.,3
PARIS,Wow what?,3
RORY,Your speech must really suck.,3
PARIS,Excuse me?,3
RORY,"I mean, if you're going to all this trouble to psych out everyone else, then you must know you have a loser there.",3
PARIS,"Mind games. Not your forte, cupcake. Stick to talking to losers off the train tracks, will you?",3
RORY,You're horrible.,3
PARIS,,3
LORELAI,Hello,3
SOOKIE,It's me.,3
LORELAI,"Every detail, leave nothing out.",3
SOOKIE,"Well, I told him.",3
LORELAI,Did he flip? Did he cry? Did he scream?,3
SOOKIE,No.,3
LORELAI,No? Did he hear you?,3
SOOKIE,"Yeah, he heard me.",3
LORELAI,"I don't understand, what happened?",3
SOOKIE,"Well, I came home an d I got some flowers and I chilled some glasses and I put some music on and I opened a bottle of champagne, and the cork broke the window so I had to clean up the glass, and then I taped some cardboard over the hole, and then I knocked over the bottle of champagne, so I had to get out the mop.",3
LORELAI,"My finger's hitting the fast forward button, hon.",3
SOOKIE,"So, he came home an d I handed him a beer, and I smiled and I kissed him and I told him he was gonna be a daddy.",3
LORELAI,And then he did what?,3
SOOKIE,Then he got out the calculator.,3
LORELAI,What?,3
SOOKIE,He's been crunching numbers for two hours.,3
LORELAI,He didn't say anything?,3
SOOKIE,No.,3
LORELAI,Mr.  I-want-four-in-four' hears he can check off number one and he says nothing?,3
SOOKIE,"Okay, not nothing.",3
LORELAI,Thank you.,3
SOOKIE,"Every fifteen minutes, he says,  Oh, boy.'",3
LORELAI," Oh, boy' like  Oh, boy!'?",3
SOOKIE,"No,  Oh, boy' like  Oh, boy.'",3
JACKSON,"Oh, boy.",3
SOOKIE,Did you hear that?,3
LORELAI,"Well, maybe he's in shock.",3
JACKSON,"Oh, boy.",3
SOOKIE,Maybe.,3
JACKSON,"Oh, boy.",3
LORELAI,"Honey, I'd go in there and take that calculator away from him if I were you.",3
SOOKIE,This wasn't how it was supposed to go.,3
LORELAI,"I know, sweetie, but give it time. It's a big thing.",3
SOOKIE,He said he wanted this.,3
LORELAI,"He loves you, he wants this.",3
JACKSON,"Oh, boy.",3
SOOKIE,Uh huh.,3
LORELAI,"Hang in there, I'll call you later.",3
SOOKIE,I'll be here.,3
JACKSON,,3
DEAN,It's right there!,3
KIRK,Just a second.,3
DEAN,I see it. Can I just  ,3
KIRK,"Yeah, I can do it.",3
DEAN,"Kirk, it's right there!",3
KIRK,"You are yelling at me, and I have to tell you that that is not the way to get results.",3
DEAN,You keep passing it.,3
KIRK,You are making me crazy.,3
LORELAI,"Dean, I just need. . .oh, hey, that's my water bill.",3
DEAN,He's been down there for twenty minutes.,3
LORELAI,"Kirk, you have to sort the mail first.",3
KIRK,"Everybody is always telling me w hat to do. Everybody else is always right. Well, I'm sorry, but I am the mail carrier in this town and I will carry the mail the way that I carry the mail, and if you don't like that, then you can carry the mail. But you'll have to apply for the job first and get hired. And there's a test, and it is a hard test, my friend. Ow, paper cut.",3
LORELAI,"Dean, I need some of that non-drowsy allergy medicine stuff.",3
DEAN,Did you check in the back with the aspirin?,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, nothing.",3
DEAN,"Then we're probably out. I could tell you when they're expected in, but I haven't gotten the mail yet.",3
KIRK,Shut up.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, nevermind, I'll just grab some when I get to Hartford. See if you can get my water bill for me.",3
DEAN,"All right, I'll do my best. I'm giving you five minutes to get up, then I'm getting the mop.",3
KIRK,,3
LORELAI,"Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay, show me a difference, people. Why can't I pick one? Ooh, on sale, that's it, good, done.",3
LORELAI,Max.,3
MAX,Lorelai.,3
LORELAI,Hi.,3
MAX,Hi back.,3
LORELAI,I didn't know you had a cold.,3
MAX,I just recently found out myself.,3
LORELAI,"Well, wow. You. Hi. How have you been?",3
MAX,I've been good.,3
LORELAI,Good.,3
MAX,I've been in California.,3
LORELAI,"Well, cowabunga dude.",3
MAX,"Yes, that's my official California name.",3
LORELAI,"So, California, huh?",3
MAX,"Stanford, actually. I was teaching a class there.",3
LORELAI,"Well, good. It's about time that dump got some decent teachers.",3
MAX,"Yes, they're really trying to turn the place around.",3
LORELAI,"Well, so, if you were living in California, then what are you doing back here?",3
MAX,"Well, this place has the best selection.",3
LORELAI,In Hartford.,3
MAX,"My class ended, and I thought I'd come back for the Chilton Bicentennial.",3
LORELAI,Ah.,3
MAX,What are you doing here in Hartford?,3
LORELAI,Friday night?,3
MAX,The infamous Gilmore dinners.,3
LORELAI,Yeah.,3
MAX,How's that going?,3
LORELAI,"Uh, great. We had to add on an extra room for all the emotional baggage, but other than that, there's been no bloodshed as of yet.",3
MAX,"Well, I'm glad to hear it. And Rory's good?",3
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, she's the Encyclopedia Britannica definition of good.",3
MAX,Grades?,3
LORELAI,Perfect.,3
MAX,Same boyfriend?,3
LORELAI,Different boyfriend.,3
MAX,Really?,3
LORELAI,Yeah.,3
MAX,You hate him.,3
LORELAI,"No, I don't.",3
MAX,You really hate him.,3
LORELAI,"I smile, I say hi, I let him eat the good cookies.",3
MAX,You wanna have him k*lled.,3
LORELAI,Only if I get a really good price.,3
MAX,"She's young, she'll move on, she's got college next year.",3
LORELAI,"Great. Frat boys, I cannot wait.",3
MAX,"Just get a keg, keeps them distracted.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, well, thanks for the advice. I'm gonna lock her up in a tower when I get home.",3
MAX,"Glad I could help. Well, listen, I, um, have this dinner I have to get to.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, yeah. Me, too. Me, too. So. . .",3
MAX,It was nice to see you.,3
LORELAI,"It was nice to see you, too.",3
MAX,Bye.,3
LORELAI,,3
RICHARD,"Ah, you're here.",3
LORELAI,And you are by far the most masculine-looking maid my parents have ever had.,3
RICHARD,"It's chaos here. The second maid called in sick, the first is busy with dinner, and your poor mother is at the hospital. Her DAR group suffered a surfeit of strokes this week.",3
LORELAI,Come ag ain?,3
RICHARD,Three of her friends had strokes. And now she is hopping from sick bed to sick bed offering whatever comfort she can.,3
LORELAI,Three DAR strokes. What's in that water they're drinking?,3
RICHARD,"Well, a little whiskey, usually. Oh, and you're forgetting Liesl.",3
LORELAI,What?,3
RICHARD,Our East-German maid. She was much more masculine-looking than me.,3
LORELAI,"Right, the muttonchops.",3
RICHARD,Here is Rory.,3
LORELAI,"Thanks, I wouldn't have recognized her. Hi hon.",3
RORY,Hi. Did you hear about the strokes?,3
LORELAI,"Yes, stay away from whiskey and the DAR.",3
RICHARD,Your mother would make you throw that out at this point.,3
LORELAI,How about I exchange it for a martini?,3
RICHARD,"Ah, coming up. Oh, good I'm expecting an important call. This could be it.",3
LORELAI,"Uh, Dad, if the maid is busy with dinner and the second one's out and Mom's at the hospital. . . you know.",3
RICHARD,"Oh, right, right. I'll get it!",3
LORELAI,Alone at last. Have I got something to tell you.,3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,Or maybe you have something to tell me.,3
RORY,"Don't do that, I have nothing.",3
LORELAI,Or are you minimizing what you know? Maybe you should maximize it.,3
RORY,I'm confused.,3
LORELAI,Maximize it.,3
RORY,I'm maximum c onfused.,3
LORELAI,I ran into Max.,3
RORY,Medina?,3
LORELAI,At the pharmacy. Did you know he was back?,3
RORY,"No. He was, like, on loan somewhere.",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, at Stanford. But he's back now, for a little while at least, and I am happy to report that either he's forgiven me for treating him so badly or it wasn't that bad and I just built it up worse in my head.",3
RORY,"Oh no, you treated him like crap",3
LORELAI,"Well, he was very big about it. He didn't recoil or blow me off. We had a nice chat. It was good to see him.",3
RORY,He's a great guy.,3
LORELAI,He is.,3
RORY,"And a great teacher, too. I'm glad he's back.",3
LORELAI,"Good. He seems glad, too.",3
RICHARD,"That was not my call, and for a second there, I thought a fourth friend of your mother's had had a stroke.",3
RORY,"Oh, no.",3
RICHARD,"But then I realized that it was one of the original stroke ladies' husband's calling to inform me o f her stroke, which we already knew about, so here we are.",3
LORELAI,Thank God.,3
RICHARD,"So, Rory has been telling me about the Chilton Bicentennial and her speech.",3
RORY,"Well, it's not my speech yet. I have to qualify for it.",3
RICHARD,"Oh, you'll get it.",3
LORELAI,She'll be on C-SPAN if she does.,3
RICHARD,Very good.,3
RORY,It's not like anyone would watch it.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, they will. You're a hell of a lot more interesting than that usual shot they have of allthe white men walking around that big empty chamber with the numbers all over them.",3
RICHARD,"That's a televised house vote, and I find that fascinating.",3
LORELAI,It's like watching the Men's Warehouse security camera.,3
RICHARD,When is your speech? I'd like to be there.,3
RORY,"Again, it's not my speech yet, but it's Friday at five.",3
RICHARD,"Oh, well, that's tough. Could they move it to six?",3
RORY,I don't think so.,3
RICHARD,"Well, maybe I'll move my thing.",3
RORY,That might be best.,3
RICHARD,"Oh, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it!",3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,Speed dial. I just like seeing him do that.,3
RICHARD,,3
SOOKIE,"Ah, thank God, someone sane. Come on up.",3
LORELAI,Your phone has been busy all night and I am dying to know what the doctor said.,3
SOOKIE,"He said, ""Congratulations, it's an It!""",3
LORELAI,"Ah, I loved being pregnant.",3
SOOKIE,You'll give me lots of tips?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, what I can rememb er.",3
SOOKIE,Get your diary out from that year  cause I wanna know it all.,3
LORELAI,"A lot of my diary from that year was, um, a debate over which member of Tears for Fears I loved more at that particular moment.",3
SOOKIE,That's probably not going to help me much.,3
LORELAI,What are you doing out here? It's cold.,3
SOOKIE,"Well, we finished eating and I needed a break. Rough day. We didn't get home until eight.",3
LORELAI,Eight? Your appointment was at six.,3
SOOKIE,Jackson won't drive home faster than seven miles an hour. He doesn't wanna jiggle Baby.,3
LORELAI,Oh my God.,3
SOOKIE,"We spent ten minutes on one speed bump. I could've walked home faster. And he's got this wild look in his eye like he's some kind of death rocker or something, and he's making lots of calls, and he punched the calculator so much he broke it.",3
JACKSON,We're selling the truck.,3
SOOKIE,What?,3
JACKSON,It's the only way we're going to afford the minivan.,3
SOOKIE,I thought you broke the calculator.,3
JACKSON,I'm using a pencil. Hi Lorelai.,3
LORELAI,"Hi Jackson, congratulations.",3
SOOKIE,We don't need a van.,3
JACKSON,"And I'm getting a haircut and buying a second tie. Oh, I'll get it. It's probably the contractor.",3
SOOKIE,What contractor?,3
JACKSON,The add-on.,3
SOOKIE,What add-on?,3
JACKSON,"The expansion, Sookie, the expansion.",3
SOOKIE,He's expanding something.,3
LORELAI,"He's, uh, being very cryptic.",3
SOOKIE,I don't wanna expand anything. And did you see his eyes?,3
LORELAI,Tasmanian devil.,3
SOOKIE,"When I came home, he was baby-proofing the house, he'd thrown away all our prescription dr*gs, and he was stuffing newspaper into the electrical sockets. He's insane.",3
JACKSON,"Hold on, Tom. He says we have to move out for three months to do the add-on. We probably don't wanna do that.",3
SOOKIE,Probably not.,3
LORELAI,Have you tried slapping him?,3
SOOKIE,"No, he won't let me lift my arm above my head in case it stretches Baby. This stinks. We never even got to celebrate. He went straight to budgets and minivans.",3
LORELAI,"Aw, well, what he's doing is sweet in its own obnoxious way.",3
SOOKIE,I guess I'll have to let him be male.,3
LORELAI,"So, listen, um, I ran into Max Medina.",3
SOOKIE,"Oh my God, really? How weird was that?",3
LORELAI,A little. Not as much as I would have thought.,3
SOOKIE,He's such a good guy.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, people are pretty unanimous on that.",3
SOOKIE,"Well, was he nice to you?",3
LORELAI,"Very. I mean, what happened with us was so long ago. Do you think what I did to him was really horrible?",3
SOOKIE,You mean dumping him in the gutter? Sure.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, people are pretty unanimous on that, too.",3
SOOKIE,"So, Max Medina's back.",3
LORELAI,"Not for long, though. I just hope he doesn't hate me. He was probably just being nice. I just don't want him to hate me.",3
SOOKIE,You didn't mean to hurt him.,3
LORELAI,I'll write him a note or something. I owe him that. LORELAI/,3
SOOKIE,Oh!,3
JACKSON,What is this?,3
SOOKIE,It's my cleaver.,3
JACKSON,What if Baby fell on it?,3
SOOKIE,"You mean, what if Baby rolled off the sink and into the open second drawer? It wouldn't be good.",3
JACKSON,It has to go.,3
SOOKIE,I need it to chop stuff.,3
JACKSON,We're switching to plastic.,3
SOOKIE,I can't use plastic.,3
JACKSON,"And the Saran Wrap's history, too.",3
SOOKIE,,3
RORY,Hello?,3
WOMAN,"Rory Gilmore, please.",3
RORY,This is Rory Gilmore.,3
WOMAN,Please hold. I'm connecting Headmaster Charleston and Paris Gellar.,3
RORY,"What? You're what, hello?",3
WOMAN,Miss Gilmore?,3
RORY,I'm here.,3
WOMAN,Miss Gellar?,3
PARIS,I'm here.,3
WOMAN,"Please hold, I'm connecting Headmaster Charleston. Miss Gilmore, Miss Gellar, you have Headmaster Charleston.",3
HEADMASTERory,"Ladies, hello. I hope you're having a pleasant evening.",3
RORY,"Yes, sir.",3
PARIS,Very pleasant.,3
HEADMASTERory,"Wonderful to hear. Well, let's get down to it, shall we? I was very impressed with both of your speeches today. They were well written, well researched, and eloquently delivered. You should be very proud.",3
RORY,"Thank you, we were.",3
PARIS,Who won?,3
HEADMASTERory,"Just the simple act of completing a task well is in itself a win, is it not Miss Gellar?",3
PARIS,"Yes, sir.",3
HEADMASTERory,"Wonderful. Anyhow, as I was listening to you both this afternoon, a thought kept rolling around in my head. I was thinking what a pity it is I will have to choose just one. But then I realized,  Hold on a minute here. I'm the headmaster at this school, I'm in charge of this competition, I can change the rules if I wish to.' So I am.",3
RORY,You are?,3
PARIS,You are what?,3
HEADMASTERory,"I am changing the rules. Instead of having one speaker at our bicentennial, we will have two. You will combine your speeches and present them together.",3
PARIS,You're kidding.,3
HEADMASTERory,"I assure you I am not. I think it will be an excellent way to pay proper tribute to our school. So, what do you think of my little plan?",3
RORY,Well. . .,3
PARIS,"It's, uh. . .",3
HEADMASTERory,"Brilliant. Yes, I think so, too. That's all. Congratulations. I would like the revised copy of your speech on my desk by Tuesday. Enjoy the rest of your weekend.",3
PARIS,"Well, look who's suddenly decided to become Kofi Annan.",3
RORY,Excuse me?,3
PARIS,"Charleston thinks we need to play nice with each other, so he screws up the whole bicentennial. This sucks.",3
RORY,"Yes, it does suck.",3
PARIS,"So, what do we do now?",3
RORY,Do we have a choice?,3
PARIS,Of course we have a choice. You could say no.,3
RORY,Why could I say no? You could say no.,3
PARIS,I could not say no. C-SPAN is going to be there.,3
RORY,"Well, I like C-SPAN as much as you do.",3
PARIS,You do not.,3
RORY,"I do, too. Ask my mom, it's all I talk about.",3
PARIS,"So, I guess we need a game plan now.",3
RORY,Okay. We can meet at school tomorrow and work on it.,3
PARIS,Or we could do it over the phone.,3
RORY,Over the phone?,3
PARIS,"We're just combining two speeches, Rory. There's no reason we have to sit in the same room and stare at each other.",3
RORY,"Fine, whatever you want.",3
PARIS,"Tomorrow night, six o'clock, I'll call you.",3
RORY,,3
RORY,What are you doing here?,3
PARIS,We have a speech to write.,3
RORY,"Yes, but we were supposed to do it over the phone. That was the plan.",3
PARIS,"Well, it's a ridiculous plan. We have to put two speeches together. We have to rehearse them, we have to hone our timing. None of that can be done effectively over the phone.",3
RORY,But it was your idea.,3
PARIS,"Oh, like you fought me on it?",3
RORY,Of course I didn't fight you on it.,3
PARIS,"Well, okay then.",3
RORY,"What, okay then? Our conversation did not just come to a close. There was not a decision made back there just now.",3
PARIS,"Look, I'm here, we should just do this and get it over with. Do you wanna study here or in your bedroom? Fine, I'll go to a payphone. Do you have payphones in this town or are you still using a town crier?",3
RORY,We'll do it here.,3
PARIS,Whatever you say.,3
PARIS,"So, I think the first thing to do is to acquaint ourselves with each others' speeches so we can judge who hit which point best. Here.",3
RORY,Mine.,3
PARIS,Good. Let's read. Why did you use this font?,3
RORY,Because I was on the crack.,3
PARIS,Did you check these facts?,3
RORY,"Yes, I did.",3
PARIS,And the spelling of these names?,3
RORY,"Yes, I did.",3
PARIS,Rory?,3
RORY,"What, Paris?",3
PARIS,"I slept with Jamie. Last night, after we talked.",3
RORY,Was it something I said?,3
PARIS,I went over there to study and he lit a fire and then we did it. What are your thoughts on that?,3
RORY,My thoughts?,3
PARIS,"Because I'm not exactly sure how I feel about it myself yet. I've been going over it in my head. I mean, it seemed to go pretty well. The fire was nice and thank God he didn't try to put on any ridiculous makeout music, and then it just happened. I was actually fairly surprised at the timing of it because I wasn't wearing anything particularly alluring, and in the moments just before the act. . .",3
RORY,"Oh, God.",3
PARIS,"We were actually discussing modern day Marxism in America, which is not what I would have deemed a  come an d get it' sort of conversation, but nevertheless, he came and got it, and I have to figure out what that means to me on a psychological level. So, I thought maybe if you and I could have sort of a healthy debate about it, I could come to some sort of reasonable conclusion about how I should be feeling right about now. So, come on, talk. What do you think?",3
RORY,I  ,3
PARIS,Are you pro?,3
RORY,Well  ,3
PARIS,Con?,3
RORY,Well  ,3
PARIS,Undecided?,3
RORY,"Paris, just stop talking for one second and let me get my mind around this.",3
PARIS,"Sorry, go ahead, focus.",3
PARIS,Could you focus faster because I really need some feedback here.,3
RORY,"Okay, so you are telling me that you and Jamie. . .",3
PARIS,Had sex.,3
RORY,"Okay, so, were you safe?",3
PARIS,"Yes, it was a regular after school special.",3
RORY,"Well, was he nice to you?",3
PARIS,"Yes, he was very nice to me.",3
RORY,And the two of you had discussed this. . .,3
PARIS,"Well, I don't know that we actually discussed it, it was just sort of implied.",3
RORY,Implied?,3
PARIS,"Yes, implied. When you're dating a boy and you're together for a given amount of time and you're not Amish, then the eventual occurrence of intercourse is inevitable. I mean, wasn't it with you?",3
RORY,What?,3
PARIS,With Dean.,3
RORY,No.,3

PARIS,Why not?,3
RORY,I just haven't. It's just not the time.,3
PARIS,"Why is it not the time? I mean, if it's not the time for you, then maybe it's not the time for me eit her.",3
RORY,"Paris, you can't judge what's right for you against what's right for me. I mean, we are different, and Jamie an d Jess are different.",3
PARIS,"Well, yeah.",3
RORY,Maybe it was the time for the two of you.,3
PARIS,I guess. I just wish I had the data to back it up.,3
RORY,Some things can't be analyzed.,3
PARIS,"Listen, Rory, these last few weeks, Francie got things all twisted around.",3

RORY,"What? No. I mean, yes. Paris is supposed to be here and she's not.",3
LORELAI,"Well, maybe she's just had a clothing crisis.",3
RORY,Maybe.,3
LORELAI,Do you wanna call her?,3
RORY,"I did, no answer.",3
LORELAI,"I'm sure she's fine, there's traffic. Just relax.",3
RORY,Okay.,3
RICHARD,There you are.,3
LORELAI,Hi.,3
RORY,"Grandpa, you came.",3

LORELAI,"I always meant to call you, but I'm not good at calling when a call is really necessary.

LORELAI,You're welcome.,3
MAX,"And being away gave me time to think. I thought, and now I'm fine.",3
LORELAI,"It's just, we never had any closure.",3

RORY,"Okay, great.",3
RICHARD,"You are going to be wonderful, trust me. Now, did anyone ever to tell you to picture the audience in their underwear?",3

RORY,"""Apply yourself. Get all the education you can, but then do something. Don't just stand there, make it happen."" Lee Iacocca. ""Education's purpose is to replace an empty mind with an open one."" Malcolm Forbes. ""Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught."" Oscar Wilde. These are only three of many countless views on the expansion of the human mind. I personally believe in all of them, and fortunately for me, so does Chilton. An institution not just because of age and standing, but because of ideas. Because it encourages ideas and it will accept nothing less than everything you have to give. This is the place where our lives start.",3
PARIS,"You know, it's funny, me standing here before you right now. I've thought about nothing else for four years but this school, this big important school with all of its history and tradition and really super teachers. And I dedicated myself to it completely, heart and soul, believing in its power, believing in its ability to get me where I needed to go. Harvard. I thought of nothing else. Many of you out there can attest to that fact. I was on my way and nothing could stop me. And here's the really funny thing   after four years of slaving away, I go home today and I found this. I'm not going to Harvard. I got the tiny envelope, the one that reads, ""Sorry, Paris. We're not interested. Try again next year. Love, Harvard."" And the thing that's really funny here is, who in the world deserves to go to Harvard more than me? Have you seen how hard I've worked over these past four years? I mean, can anyone here believe that I'm not going to Harvard? I can't. I'm not going to Harvard. I am not going to Harvard. I had sex, but I'm not going to Harvard.",3
RORY,Okay.,3
PARIS,"And I have to tell you that if you asked me which of those two events I thought would be the least likely to happen, it would not be the not going to Harvard.",3
RORY,Thank you and good night.,3
PARIS,"I'm being punished. I had sex, so now I don't get to go to Harvard.",3
RORY,"Paris, come on.",3
PARIS,"She's never had sex. She'll probably go to Harvard. She's a shoe in. Pack your chastity belt, Gilmore   you're going to Harvard!",3
RORY,,3
PARIS,"How could I have not gotten into Harvard? Five generations of Gellars have gotten into Harvard. Even if I was the Billy Carter of the family, the name is still supposed to carry some weight.",3
RORY,Paris.,3
PARIS,They had to really not like me for me to not get in.,3
RORY,Paris.,3
PARIS,It's like they know me or something.,3
RORY,"Stop. I know how much this meant to you, Paris, but you are going to get just as good an education at one of the other great schools you're destined to get into. And you know what? Maybe it's a good thing that you're going to a different school than the rest of your family. You'll be doing your own thing, starting your own tradition. Doesn't that sound exciting?",3
PARIS,I can't believe I slept with Jamie. I'm a sl*t.,3
RORY,"No, you're not. You love him.",3
PARIS,What if he doesn't love me an ymore? What if he doesn't think I'm special anymore? How am I going to tell him I didn't get into Harvard? What am I gonna do?,3
RORY,"Paris, I don't know why you didn't get into Harvard, but you are so smart and so special and you'll see, everything's gonna be fine.",3
LORELAI,"Hey, I just wanted to make sure everything was okay.",3
RORY,"Yeah, we've got everything under control, thanks.",3
LORELAI,Okay. I'll be outside when you're ready. No rush.,3
RORY,Thanks.,3
PARIS,"Well, all I've gotta say is, after all the trouble this sex thing has caused me, I better have been good.",3
RORY,,3
LORELAI,"Dad, hi, sorry. I was just checking on the girls.",3
RICHARD,"Well, I hope they're feeling very good about themselves. They did a wonderful job.",3
LORELAI,"Yes, well, I'm sure they'll be very pleased to hear you think so.",3
RICHARD,"Listen, um, I need to get home. Uh, I'm expecting a very important call from China that unfortunately I cannot miss.",3
LORELAI,"That's fine, Dad. I'll tell Rory you had to go.",3
RICHARD,"All right. And tell her I'll call her later, and give her this.",3
LORELAI,"Aw, that's very nice. Now how about my finder's fee?",3
RICHARD,"You're very amusing. Thank you for a lovely evening, and I'll see the two of you on Friday.",3
LORELAI,Good night. Sleep tight.,3
LORELAI,"Um, excuse me, hi. I am not seeing my coat here, and it was very cute and it was on sale, and I will fling myself off a building if I lose it.",3
WOMAN,"We put some of the coat racks in the classroom over there, take a look. Otherwise the staircase to the roof is on your right.",3
LORELAI,,3
MAX,"Okay. So, this is where they keep the coats they're ashamed of.",3
LORELAI,"Well, this school has taken snobbery to a whole new level.",3
MAX,"So, is Rory okay?",3
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, I just went back there. She's taking care of Paris, but she's good, thanks.",3
MAX,"I must say, I've been a teacher for ten years now, and it wasn't until today I realized, it must be really hard to be a girl.",3
LORELAI,"And with the invention of Sephora, really expensive, too.",3
MAX,I'm very sorry.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, don't be. At least we get to wear skirts without being Scottish or riding a float in the gay pride parade.",3
MAX,"Well, that'll change someday my friend, and when it does, I still won't wear a skirt. But I'll applaud those that do, and then cross the street so nobody sees I'm with them.",3
LORELAI,It was nice seeing you.,3
MAX,"Nice to see you, too.",3
LORELAI,Take care of yourself.,3
MAX,I will.,3

Now, I'm sorry that you think this house is a deathtrap, and I'm sorry that you think there is nothing in our lifestyles that is conducive to having a baby, but our kid is gonna have to be bright enough not to disconnect the water hose that goes to the a*t*matic ice maker and shove it up his or her nose. Now go to sleep.",3

LORELAI,"Oh, whoa, whoa, those are not the final official pro/con lists.",3
RORY,Why? What's wrong with them?,3
LORELAI,"Well, the lines are crooked, the printing's all sloppy. Harvard, Princeton and Yale cannot see them looking like that.",3
RORY,They're not going to see our pro/con lists.,3
LORELAI,What if they subpoena them?,3
RORY,Then I'll roll them up in a ball and eat them.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, a big pro for Yale   they have 1100 members of the maintenance staff. Clean, clean, clean.",3
RORY,All three of these places probably have the same number.,3
LORELAI,But Yale must be crowing about it for some reason. Princeton might only have two.,3

RORY,Neat.,3

LORELAI,"Yeah, it shows he can work hard and get along with people and all that. You should be proud. Did you tell him you're proud?",3

LORELAI,Are you going?,3

LORELAI,"No, but it means you'll have the best on-campus productions. You'll get to see the next Meryl Streep all goofy and eighteen and doing crap like, ""Hey, name an occupation!"" ""Plumber!"" ""Name a f arm tool now!"" ""Tractor!"" ""Hey, I'm a tractor doing. . .plumbing.""",3
RORY,That's what the do at the Yale drama school?,3
LORELAI,"So I've heard. Oh, that's weird.",3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,Over there.,3
RORY,A second Poe?,3
LORELAI,It's like a Poe story in itself.,3
RORY,The Case of the Two Poes.,3
LORELAI,The Messrs Poe and Poe.,3
RORY,"Oh, that's good.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, hey, there's Dean. Hey, is that, uh. . .",3
RORY,That's Lindsay.,3
LORELAI,Hm.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, I think she's ready to go to the ghetto on you.",3
RORY,"Well, I don't have a problem with her. She's really nice. And, you know, once she  ",3
LORELAI,"Bought you a magnet shaped like Mark Twain's head? Yes, I've heard the anecdote.",3
RORY,Sorry.,3
LORELAI,"I think she should just mellow. I mean, you've both moved on. What's the problem? POE 1: But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only that one word. . .",3
LORELAI,I don't rememb er The Raven being this long.,3
RORY,It could've used some ed iting.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, hey, did you put drama school on the Yale pro list?",3
RORY,Nope.,3
LORELAI,"Come on, do it, we'll forget.",3
RORY,I don't have a pen.,3
LORELAI,"Aw, jeez. Hey, psst. Hi, Nicole.",3
NICOLE,"Hi, Lorelai.",3
LUKE,"Hey, how long is this thing?",3
LORELAI,He's got at least five nevermores to go.,3
LUKE,"Ah, jeez.",3
LORELAI,Do you got a pen?,3
LUKE,No.,3
LORELAI,"Come on, cough it up.",3
LUKE,I don't have a pen.,3
LORELAI,You've got a restaurant. Where's the pen you take orders with?,3
LUKE,I wasn't anticipating taking orders at the Poe reading.,3
LORELAI,"Hm, there goes your Boy Scout badge.",3
RORY,"Uh, Mom. POE 1: Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy. . .",3
LORELAI,Busted by a Poe.,3
RORY,Hope he doesn't put a curse on us.,3
LORELAI,"Or complain when he goes back to being Fred Larson, Tampa dentist.",3
NICOLE,"Hey, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,"Hm? Oh, you're an angel, thanks.",3
NICOLE,I'll need it back.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, sure.",3
RORY,"Hm, looks like Nicole's got a little Lindsay attitude going.",3
LORELAI,,3
PATTY,"Hey, how many nevermores do you think he's got to go?",3
LORELAI,,3
PATTY,"Poor Edgar Allen Poe, he suffered so much. And now we gotta suffer along with him.",3
RORY,,3
PATTY,"Rory, why do you waste your time on those pro/con lists? It's going to be Harvard, we all know it.",3
RORY,I know.,3
LORELAI,If the list says it is.,3
RORY,,3
PATTY,"When you were six and took my cheerleading class, you wouldn't even cheer for any other school than Harvard.",3
RORY,That's true. That is true.,3
LORELAI,"Well, then the list will reflect it. POE 1: And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted. . .nevermore.",3
LORELAI,"Excellent. Bravo, bravo.",3
RORY,Very nice.,3
WOMAN,"That was wonderful, wasn't it? Thank you very much for that rendition. POE 1: Thank you.",3
LORELAI,What's with the Poes?,3
RORY,,3
PATTY,Wanna hear the scoop?,3
RORY,,3
PATTY,"I was here when they both arrived. They got their signals crossed. They were supposed to perform different things, but they both came to do The Raven.",3
LORELAI,"If the Poes start fighting, does that punch a hole in the space/time continuum?",3
RORY,And throw us into a universe where everything is the exact opposite of what it is here?,3
LORELAI,Cool. There'll be funny sitcoms there.,3
WOMAN,"Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special treat for you. It'll allow you to compare and contrast interpretations of Poe's most famous work.",3
RORY,Oh no.,3
LORELAI,Compare and contrast?,3
RORY,That can only mean. . .,3
WOMAN,Please enjoy this second recitation of The Raven.,3
LORELAI,Do we bolt?,3
RORY,Do we dare?,3
LORELAI,"At least if I'd brought a flask, we could've played the nevermore drinking game.",3
RORY,"Oh, maybe this is what drove Poe to the bottle.",3
LORELAI,"His own work. POE 2: Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered weak and weary, over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, while I nodded, nearly napping. . .",3
LORELAI,Weird vibe in here. Very Poe.,3
RORY,,3
RORY,"Well, that was pretty good.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, come on. You can't do that thing where you complain, then when you walk out you reassess based on the relief you're feeling that it's over.",3
RORY,"Well, I was able to compare and contrast between readings.",3
LORELAI,"I was able to nap for twenty minutes. POE 1: Good evening, ladies.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, hi Poe.",3
RORY,"Good job in there. POE 1: I thank you. Young miss, do correct me, but I heard tell that you are considering attending Harvard University.",3
RORY,I am. POE 1: I myself attended West Point.,3
LORELAI,"Wow. POE 1: I'm emb arrassed to say that I was court-martialed in 1832 and forced to leave. POE 2: Excuse me, but I was expelled from West Point in 1831, not 1832.",3
LORELAI,"Oh. POE 1: No, I do believe it was 1832. It was an election year. POE 2: It was not an election year. President Jackson was to serve five more years POE 1: I'm sure it was '32. I'm sad to say it was the same year my older brother William passed away. POE 2: Okay, that's not right either, Fred. POE 1: Fred? I don't know this Fred you speak of. POE 2: Oh, knock it off. I'm tired. POE 1: Will you excuse me?",3
LORELAI,Yeah. Poes are very testy people.,3
RORY,Mmhmm.,3
KIRK,"I've got your latest topical T-shirts here, people. Brand new topical T-shirts for sale.",3
RORY,What's this one say?,3
LORELAI,"""Faux Poes foes.""",3
RORY,"Very clever, Kirk.",3
KIRK,"It was an inspiration. But they're not selling much better than the ""Babette ate oatmeal"" shirts.",3
LORELAI,"Keep the dream, Kirk.",3
DEAN,Hey guys.,3
RORY,"Oh, hi. Mom, this is Lindsay.",3
LINDSAY,Hi.,3
LORELAI,Hi. The Mark Twain magnet-head girl!,3
LINDSAY,The what?,3
LORELAI,You don't know the anecdote? You're the star.,3
LINDSAY,The anecdote?,3
RORY,"It's nothing, really. Um, it's the field trip we took to Mark Twain's house in the fourth grade, and I wanted this magnet and you lent me the money and I got the magnet.",3
LORELAI,She usually tells it better.,3
LINDSAY,I kinda rememb er.,3
DEAN,"So, uh, congratulations on Harvard.",3
RORY,"Oh, yeah, thanks.",3
DEAN,I got into Southern Connecticut State.,3
RORY,"Oh, that's great.",3
LORELAI,"It is. That's great, Dean.",3
RORY,You're. . .you're. . . wow.,3
DEAN,"Yeah, thanks.",3
LINDSAY,I've gotta get home.,3
DEAN,"And I gotta take her, so I'll see you guys.",3
LORELAI,See ya.,3
RORY,Bye.,3
LORELAI,So you say she was nice?,3
RORY,"Was, I guess, being the operative word. So are we going?",3
LORELAI,"No, you go on ahead, I'll catch up.",3
RORY,"Okay. Try and make it home in time for Charlie Rose. Billy Joel's on, and he might cry or something.",3
LORELAI,Okay.,3
LORELAI,"So, how was Jess' Employee of the Month thing?",3
LUKE,"Oh, it was okay.",3
LORELAI,Just okay?,3
LUKE,There was punch.,3
LORELAI,So the punch wasn't good?,3
LUKE,"No, it was just. . .the manager came up afterwards when Jess was gone and he was talking about how Jess is working forty, forty-five hours a week.",3
LORELAI,What? That's full time.,3
LUKE,That's what I said.,3
LORELAI,How does he swing it?,3
LUKE,He must be pulling double shifts on the weekends. It's all I can think of.,3
LORELAI,"No, he's pretty much duding it with Rory on the weekends.",3
LUKE,"Well, then he must be getting up super early on weekday mornings and going in.",3
LORELAI,Have you ever seen him do that?,3
LUKE,"No, but I don't trail him eit her.",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, but you sleep in the same room with him.",3
LUKE,"Oh, the manager must be getting Jess confused with somebody else.",3
LORELAI,Or. . .,3
LUKE,Or what?,3
LORELAI,"I don't wanna say, forget it.",3
LUKE,"No, say it, go ahead.",3
LORELAI,Or he's working when he should be in school.,3
LUKE,"Impossible, no way.",3
LORELAI,Why?,3
LUKE,"Because he knows the rules   he's gotta graduate to stay living with me. He's going, he's getting everything done, he's doing his work.",3
LORELAI,You've seen this work he's doing?,3
LUKE,"Not for awhile, but I just know that he is. No, no way he's cutting school, it's su1c1de, no way.",3
LORELAI,I shouldn't have brought it up,3
LUKE,"Ah, that's okay.",3
LORELAI,Okay.,3
LUKE,Goodnight.,3
KIRK,"Say, how can I have a career as a Poe? POE 2: It's not a career, this is just an event that we do. I write technical manuals for a living.",3
KIRK,,3
RORY,"Mom. Mom, wake up.",3
LORELAI,What?,3
RORY,"Mom, it's Tobin at the inn, something's wrong.",3
LORELAI,What's wrong?,3
RORY,The fire alarm's going off.,3
LORELAI,"That stupid alarm. It's always doing that. Tell him if he doesn't smell smoke, to reset it, and tell him he's fired and I'm gonna kick his ass around the lobby for waking me up.",3
RORY,He sounds freaked.,3
LORELAI,"Ugh. Tobin, what?. . .Oh my God. . .Okay. Get dressed.",3
RORY,What is it?,3
LORELAI,,3
BAKERory,"We've got the first engine laddering the roof, first engine. Yeah, and we need PD for traffic control.",3

BAKERory,That's okay.,3
LORELAI,The statue of you is going up just as soon as we get back in. Eighty feet tall. CHIEF,3

RORY,Yeah?,3
LORELAI,"Um, help the guests with the kids, make sure they're not freaked out. Gather them up and entertain them for awhile so the adults can catch their breath.",3
RORY,Right. I have never entertained kids   how do I do that?,3
LORELAI,"Uh, take your socks off and do a puppet show.",3
RORY,You've clearly never entertained kids either.,3
LORELAI,It's all I can think of. Get cracking.,3
RORY,"Yes, ma'am.",3
LORELAI,"Hi everybody. Good morning, and uh, whoa, talk about your change ofplans here. Unfortunately, you, uh, can't get your stuff out for at least a day. However, if you wanna get home immed iately, we will check planes, trains, whatever you need. We will send your stuff to you later as soon as we get it. But if you can't get home yet, we will provide everything short of anything illegal, and that's gonna start with the best breakfast of your lives. Uh, Sookie, go to the market and get whatever food and supplies we need for breakfast.",3
SOOKIE,Going.,3
LORELAI,"Hey, who are you on with?",3
MICHELorelai,The Cheshire Cat Inn.,3
LORELAI,"Ah, great, find people places to sleep. Excellent.",3
MICHELorelai,"Yes, my name is Michel Gerard, I used to work at the Independence Inn and I was wondering if there were any positions available.",3
MICHELorelai,,3
SOOKIE,Morning.,3
LUKE,"What, what is this?",3
SOOKIE,Phase two.,3
LUKE,Phase two?,3
SOOKIE,"Into the back, guys. March!",3
LUKE,"Hold on, those guys can't go back there.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, we're in luck, lots of empty tables. Go on and take your seats, guys.",3
LUKE,"Lorelai, what is this?",3
LORELAI,We had a fire.,3
LUKE,"Fire, where?",3
SOOKIE,Weston's Bakery.,3
LUKE,You're kidding.,3
SOOKIE,They'll have fresh blueberries.,3
LORELAI,"Perfect. Um, Weston's, hurry.",3
LUKE,Where. . .Weston's caught fire?,3
LORELAI,"No, the inn.",3
LUKE,Your inn?,3
SOOKIE,"Just move all of Luke's stuff aside, we don't need it.",3
LUKE,"Hey, wait a minute.",3
LORELAI,"Everyone's fine, the inn's still standing, we're into phase two.",3
LUKE,What is phase two?,3
SOOKIE,Just shove it aside.,3
LUKE,What are you doing?,3
SOOKIE,Making breakfast.,3
LUKE,You can't make breakfast here.,3
SOOKIE,Got any plates that aren't cracked?,3
LUKE,You're the one that's cracked.,3
SOOKIE,Nice thing to say to a pregnant woman.,3
LUKE,You're pregnant?,3
LORELAI,Could you be any farther behind?,3
SOOKIE,"Yo, Caesar, help my guys and there's a twenty in it for you.",3
LUKE,We both can't be making different stuff at the same time.,3
LORELAI,"You know, you're right. Listen, all you people who were here before we invaded, are you willing to cancel your current orders for Sookie's famous blueberry-lemon pancakes, Belgian waffles or bananas foster?",3
MAN,Sure.,3
WOMAN,Sounds good.,3
SOOKIE,"Okay, pull all of Luke's stuff off the grill and let's get cooking!",3
LUKE,I'm an island.,3
LORELAI,"Luke, I'm sorry about all this, but I'm not anticipating the inn catching fire ever again, so it's a one time only thing, okay?",3
LUKE,Like I have a choice?,3
LORELAI,You do. Say the word and we go.,3
LUKE,"Stay, cook, eat. I'll be upstairs.",3
LORELAI,You're a doll.,3
SOOKIE,,3
RORY,"""Where are you going? I told you to take out the garbage!"" ""Nag, nag, nag. I wanna watch football and sit in my reclining chair."" ""Get back here or I'm gonna get you. . ."" Oh, hey, guys, hold on a second.",3
BOY,"No, keep going.",3
RORY,"Oh, calm down there, little scooter. I'll be right back.",3
LORELAI,"Hey Shari Lewis, how's the show going?",3
RORY,"Oh, they're riveted.",3
LORELAI,Good.,3
RORY,"Yeah, but I stink. I keep repeating the same stuff over and over again.",3
LORELAI,Must be working.,3
RORY,But I named them Mr. and Mrs. Sock Puppet. I put no energy into this.,3
BOY,"Come back, Rory.",3
RORY,You would think that a lame-o sock puppet show would bore them to tears.,3
LORELAI,"It's your narrative skills. I mean, is he gonna take the garbage out, is he not gonna take the garbage out? I'm on the edge of my seat.",3
RORY,"Yeah, but they won't let me stop and I have to get to school eventually.",3
LORELAI,"Okay. Hey, guys, go on over to the diner and have breakfast with your families, and then ask the nice man in the baseball hat and the flannel shirt to do sock puppets for you. And if he says no, just ask him louder   it's part of the game!",3
BOY,Oh boy!,3
LORELAI,Go!,3
RORY,You're cruel and they love you.,3
LORELAI,,3
BABETTE,"I love computers, I just know nothing about them. What does pushing that F3 button do?",3

BABETTE,,3
PATTY,"Hello, this is the Independence Inn emergency headquarters. I'm Miss patty, I'll be assisting you today. How may I help you? The printer will be here in half an hour, I'll let him know. Thank you. Goodbye. The printer will  ",3
MICHELorelai,,3
PATTY,What?,3
MICHELorelai,,3
PATTY,I was Ricardo Montalban's receptionist for six months and he never complained.,3
MICHELorelai,,3
PATTY,Don't make me hit you.,3
LORELAI,You all set up here?,3
MICHELorelai,,3
PATTY,I'm the receptionist.,3
BABETTE,And I'm learning the computer.,3
MICHELorelai,And I'm looking for my cyanide capsule   have you seen it?,3
LORELAI,"It's nice of you to help guys, thanks. Now, at least half the Poe group needs to stay another night, so we're gonna need to find places to put them up.",3
MICHELorelai,Everything is booked.,3
LORELAI,"You checked the Cheshire Cat, the Maiden's Teacup, the Cookie House, the Sugarbear Inn?",3
MICHELorelai,"Every place that sounds like Glinda the Good Witch threw up, yes   all booked.",3
LORELAI,,3
PATTY,"Well, I can take a couple in, sweetie.",3
BABETTE,"I can, too. We got cots. Ooh-hoo-hoo, we got cots.",3
LORELAI,Great. Michel?,3
MICHELorelai,"Forget it. The Poes are weird. I'd fear being k*lled in my sleep. Plus, I don't like strangers using my toilet.",3
BABETTE,I bet the Kims could put people up. And Taylor. And Al.,3
LORELAI,And we've got our couch and my room.,3
RORY,Nope.,3
LORELAI,What?,3
RORY,"They can have my room, not yours.",3
LORELAI,"No, hon, mine's fine.",3
RORY,"Mom, no, mine. You are stressed out enough without losing your room. You need your rest, so you keep your bed, period.",3
LORELAI,I'll look selfish.,3
RORY,"Well, if anyone calls you that, I'll kick their sorry butts.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, your room under protest.",3
BABETTE,"Hey Michel, I just hit F4 and the num lock key and the one with the little apple on it and it's freaking out like it's on acid or something.",3
MICHELorelai,,3
PATTY,I got it. Yeah?,3
MICHELorelai,,3
PATTY,"Well, make up your mind.",3
RORY,"I've gotta go, but page me if there's any news or anything.",3
LORELAI,"Okay. You mean, like if Michel kills Babette and then Patty then himself in a bizarre m*rder-m*rder-su1c1de pact?",3
RORY,Amongst other things.,3
LORELAI,We had a fire.,3
RORY,,3
MALLEY,"It'll be the last midterm of your high school careers, so rejoice over that if nothing else. Now, before you go, I just wanna mention that it looks like another banner year for Chilton grads seeking top colleges. I wanna congratulate all of those who have heard and advisepatience for all of you who have not. No one has escaped from Chilton without going onto another terrific school if that is his or her goal.",3
LOUISE,,3
MALLEY,"And I know that at least one of you has been accepted to Harvard. It's an immense honor, that. Congratulations.",3
RORY,Have you guys heard from Paris?,3
MADELINE,Heard what?,3
RORY,Anything?,3
LOUISE,She's not here?,3
RORY,She's been gone for five days.,3
LOUISE,Huh.,3
MADELINE,Didn't notice.,3
LOUISE,,3
PARIS,"Come back for the tray later, Nanny.",3
RORY,"It's not Nanny, Paris. It's Rory. Can I come in?",3
PARIS,I guess.,3
RORY,"Hi. I brought a bunch of school stuff from the past few days. If there's anything missing, I can bring it over later.",3
PARIS,"Thank you. No offense, but my soap's starting.",3
RORY,"So, you're sick, huh?",3
PARIS,You know what's wrong. You of all people. That's Martin. His sister-in-law got kidnapped and he thinks his former lover is behind it.,3
RORY,Juicy.,3
PARIS,"So, don't you have an announcement?",3
RORY,What do you mean?,3
PARIS,Did you get in?,3
RORY,"You know, we don't have to. . .",3
PARIS,"I know you did. You've got that Harvard glow about you, the glow of destiny.",3
RORY,Paris.,3
PARIS,Just tell me.,3
RORY,I got in.,3
PARIS,"Ugh, Amanda and Richard. I'm so over them.",3
RORY,So you've been incommunicado lately.,3
PARIS,"I've had Nanny hold all my calls, and the mail. My parents are away, so I've been totally Howard Hughes-ing it.",3
RORY,So did you tell them about Harvard?,3
PARIS,No.,3
RORY,Don't you think you should?,3
PARIS,No.,3
RORY,"Well, don't you think they'll find out?",3
PARIS,How?,3
RORY,"Well, you not moving out might be a tip-off.",3
PARIS,"I'll get an apartment in Cambridge, buy a Harvard sweatshirt, talk about Mira Sorvino a lot. It's doable. I did tell my mother about having sex with Jamie, and her only reaction was to talk about how my father hasn't pleased her in fifteen years.",3
RORY,Yikes.,3
PARIS,Like I couldn't tell.,3
RORY,And what's going on with your boyfriend?,3
PARIS,I haven't called him eit her.,3
RORY,So the only people in your life right now work at General Hospital?,3
PARIS,This isn't General Hospital. I don't deserve General Hospital.,3
RORY,"Okay, you've got to stop doing this.",3
PARIS,What happened? Harvard was my destiny. I was flipping through Harvard class schedules when you were still delighting to The Adventures of Gumby and Pokie.,3
RORY,I was more of a Pee Wee Herman kind of gal.,3
PARIS,"It's partly my parents' fault, they didn't brand me properly. I should've been at the 92nd Street Y or Brick Church.",3
RORY,Prep schools?,3
PARIS,Pre-schools. It decides everything. But I'm not totally blameless. I found a spot in my interview that I'm sure doomed me.,3
RORY,You recorded your Harvard interview?,3
PARIS,"The plan was to archive everything, then donate it to the university upon my demise. Little did I expect that my demise would come this early.",3
Paris,". . .shouldn't even be taken into account. This dovetails nicely into my feelings about population control. It's a little hot in here, can we do something about that? Anyway, population control has been dramatically successful in most European countries to the detriment of some, especially Italy, which is experiencing a marked drop  ",3
Interviewer,Do you think this has anything to do with  ,3
Paris,"Whoa, whoa, just let me finish my thought here.",3
Interviewer,But Paris. . .,3
Paris,Please!,3
RORY,"Well, you said please, that's very polite.",3
PARIS,I sound like a meth addict. I might as well record the new Justin Timberlake over this.,3
RORY,"I hate that you're torturing yourself like this, in bed like this.",3
PARIS,Proust wrote all three thousand pages of In Search of Lost Time in bed. If it's good enough for him. Hey!,3
RORY,"Bed is not a life plan, and you, my friend, need a life plan, so here it is. You need to tell your parents about Harvard. You need to start taking calls from people. You need to check the mail so that you can see the other millions of universities that have no doubt accepted you and that are probably dying to be in the Paris Gellar business. You need to call your boyfriend back because he's going to be worried about you and because none of this is his fault, and you need to start by getting the hell out of bed.",3
PARIS,"You did not just say ""be in the Paris Gellar business.""",3
RORY,You know what I meant.,3
PARIS,There is no alternative to Harvard.,3
RORY,"Except Princeton, Yale, Columbia, Stanford, Sarah Lawrence, et cetera, et cetera.",3
PARIS,"Well, maybe you're right.",3
RORY,I'm unquestionably right.,3
PARIS,But I'm not jumping up this second.,3
RORY,You don't have to rush it.,3
PARIS,"And I'm going to have to keep watching this, at least until Adriana's wrongful conviction for aggravated as*ault is overturned.",3
RORY,I understand.,3
PARIS,,3
LORELAI,"You've got your remote, your water, your comic books. Looks like we've got you all set up here, Fred Junior. FRED",3
JRory,"Yes, ma'am.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, ma'am. You make me feel old. Stop it. FRED",3
JRory,"Yes, ma'am.",3
LORELAI,"No, I mean it, stop it. FRED",3
JRory,Okay.,3
FRED,I think we're out of toothpaste.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, sorry, Fred. Below the sink there's plenty more.",3
FRED,"Oh, thank you. This is kind of fun.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, well, it's fun having you guys.",3
LORELAI,"Aw, I would've done that.",3
RORY,I feel weird now.,3
LORELAI,Why?,3
RORY,About other people sleeping in my bed.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, honey, don't worry. Fred and his wife don't seem. . .",3
RORY,Don't seem what?,3
LORELAI,Like they're feeling extremely romantic.,3
RORY,"Oh, God, that didn't even cross my mind.",3
LORELAI,You're kidding! That's all I would've thought of.,3
RORY,"Well, I'm thinking about it now, thank you very much.",3
LORELAI,Got all your stuff for Lane's?,3
RORY,"Yeah, it wasn't a hard packing job.",3
LORELAI,"Wow, these have really changed.",3
RORY,What have?,3
LORELAI,"The pro/con lists. In all the hubbub, they slipped my mind. Yale.",3
RORY,What about it?,3
LORELAI,Yale.,3
RORY,What do you mean?,3
LORELAI,Yale.,3
RORY,Stop saying Yale.,3
LORELAI,It has double the pros of the other two.,3
RORY,I wouldn't say double.,3
LORELAI,"Triple over filthy, dirty Princeton. It's kicking butt.",3
RORY,But I'm not done collecting my data yet.,3
LORELAI,You have a document the length of Nicholas Nickleby here. Looks like you're done.,3
RORY,But. . .,3
LORELAI,What?,3
RORY,Look at my wall.,3
LORELAI,So?,3
RORY,So that wall says something.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, it says the Harvard merchandising department made a nice chunk of change off of us.",3
RORY,But how can I go to Yale with my wall looking like this?,3
LORELAI,"It's a wall. Look, honey, Luke was right. The pro/con lists have to come to an end eventually.",3
RORY,But Luke also reminded us that it was supposed to be Harvard regardless of a list. Everyone thinks that.,3
LORELAI,"I don't. I don't. I know I'm the one who said no to Yale loudly and a lot, but not anymore. Really, I just want what's right.",3
RORY,"I know, but it has to be right for both of us.",3
LORELAI,"If it's right for you, it's really right for me.",3
RORY,But I don't want you to hate the place I'm going.,3
LORELAI,Never.,3
FRED,"Oh. Uh, are you not ready for us yet?",3
LORELAI,"Oh, no, we're ready for you, Fred.",3
FRED,We hate to put you out.,3
RORY,"No, it's perfectly okay.",3
LORELAI,I'm guessing you two are gonna fall sound asleep the minute your heads hit that pillow.,3
FRED,"Oh yeah, we're exhausted.",3
RORY,Have a good night.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, guys, yell if you need anything. I don't wanna hear you yelling for any other reason.",3
RORY,Shh!,3
LORELAI,Ah. So where's Jess tonight?,3
RORY,Working.,3
LORELAI,"He works a lot, doesn't he?",3
RORY,"He's saving a lot, too.",3
LORELAI,Good.,3
RORY,He wants a better car. The one he's got keeps stalling.,3
LORELAI,"And he's still working at Luke's, too, right?",3
RORY,Yeah.,3
LORELAI,So is he down to part-time at school?,3
RORY,What do you mean?,3
LORELAI,Getting work credit or something?,3
RORY,"No, he's going full time.",3
LORELAI,Oh yeah?,3
RORY,Why do you say that?,3
LORELAI,"I don't know. It's just, Wal-Mart, working at Luke's, squiring you around town. . .it just seems like a lot of his time's accounted for.",3
RORY,"Well, that's crazy. He's a senior, he's going to school full time.",3
LORELAI,Just wondering.,3
RORY,Rest.,3
LORELAI,I'll try.,3
RORY,And don't start the sock puppets with Fred Junior or he'll never let you stop. Bye.,3
LORELAI,Bye.,3
LORELAI,"Excitement here never stops, Fred Junior. MR.",3
HATLESTAD,Hi there.,3
LORELAI,"The Hatlestads, hi. I thought you went home. MR.",3
HATLESTAD,"Well, breakfast was so great and the town's so nice, and you made staying over sound so fun, that we decided to take you up on it.",3
LORELAI,Oh. MR.,3
HATLESTAD,Is that okay?,3
LORELAI,"It's more than okay. Come on in,  cause you're staying here. MR.",3
HATLESTAD,Thank you.,3
LORELAI,"Your bedroom's right upstairs, you can't miss it. MR.",3
HATLESTAD,"Terrific, thanks.",3
LORELAI,"How much room you take up on that couch there, Fred Junior? FRED",3
JRory,Pretty much all of it.,3
LORELAI,,3
RORY,"So, who do you have staying in your room?",3
LANE,The second Poe and his wife.,3
RORY,"Well, for your sake, I hope they are very, very tired.",3
LANE,Why?,3
RORY,Nothing. I shouldn't have said anything. Hello?,3
LORELAI,I'm a nomad.,3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,I am the lonely wanderer. Hank Williams would be too sad to write a song about me.,3
RORY,Where are you?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, I'm a Bedouin. I'm homeless!",3
RORY,"Okay, stop with that. Where are you?",3
LORELAI,I'm walking aimlessly around town.,3
RORY,Why?,3
LORELAI,The Hatlestads showed up.,3
RORY,But they went home.,3
LORELAI,Apparently I made the whole emergency fire accommodations sound so fun that they had second thoughts.,3
RORY,You're a terrific salesman.,3
LORELAI,And a terrific idiot.,3
RORY,So where are you right this second?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, I'm in the middle of the street, a.k.a. my bedroom.",3
RORY,Mom.,3
LORELAI,"I'm by the school, Luke's, that area.",3
RORY,"Luke's, good. Go there.",3
LORELAI,It's closed.,3
RORY,But Luke is upstairs.,3
LORELAI,Oh.,3
RORY,Ask him if you can stay.,3
LORELAI,But  ,3
RORY,I bet the answer's yes.,3
LORELAI,He'll make me eat a veggie burger!,3
RORY,Get moving.,3
LORELAI,Fine. Bye.,3
RORY,Bye.,3
LORELAI,Luke! Luke! Stella!,3
LUKE,Who is that?,3
LORELAI,Lorelai.,3
LUKE,What are you doing down there?,3
LORELAI,"Enjoying some air , getting some exercise, and freezing.",3
LUKE,"Well, go home.",3
LORELAI,"Home? I have no home. Hunted, despised.",3
LUKE,What?,3
LORELAI,"It's from Ed Wood, the movie.",3
LUKE,Have you gone bonkers?,3
LORELAI,People are bunking at my place and I need somewhere to stay.,3
LUKE,And it just occurred to you now to look for a place?,3
LORELAI,The stupid Hatlestads showed up.,3
LUKE,,3
SLUTSKY,Pipe down out there!,3
LUKE,,3
SLUTSKY,"Don't talk to me that way, young man!",3
LORELAI,,3
SLUTSKY,I will not!,3
LORELAI,"No, Luke, Mrs. Slutsky.",3
LUKE,,3
SLUTSKY,Do something!,3
LORELAI,Ditto.,3
LUKE,I'm coming down.,3
LORELAI,Okay.,3
LORELAI,,3
LANE,"No, Young Chui, it was right to break up with her. Why stay in a relationship when it's not going anywhere? . . .Life's too short, exactly. . . .No, I told you a joke last night, I need more time to come up with another one. . . Look, it's getting late. I got my math test tomorrow, I better go. . .Yeah, I'll call you to tell you how it went. . . Okay, night.",3
RORY,"So Young Chui and his girlfriend are broken up, huh?",3
LANE,"Yeah, and good riddance. She was very waspy.",3
RORY,What about you and Young Chui? Are you broken up?,3
LANE,"No, my mom still thinks we're the perfect young Korean couple.",3
RORY,Weren't you supposed to be broken up by now?,3
LANE,"Yeah, but Young Chui thinks it isn't time yet.",3
RORY,Why? This is a fake relationship. You were never really going out.,3
LANE,I don't know. I bring it up every night and he just changes the subject.,3
RORY,You talk every night?,3
LANE,Pretty much. He's a little needy right now.,3
RORY,That's a lot of talking.,3
LANE,"Well, we're friends.",3
RORY,Just friends?,3
LANE,What are you getting at?,3
RORY,"Just that he's calling you every night and he keeps putting off your break-up, so God knowswhen you'll be able to date Dave Rygalski. He's asking you to tell him jokes and to let him know how your math test went. . .",3
LANE,So?,3
RORY,So. . . it sounds like he's in love with you.,3
LANE,"No. No. Young Chui is not in love with me. And it's not for you to take an innocent friendship like Young Chui and I have, with its air of innocence and its. . .innocence. Oh my God, he loves me. That stupid boy's fallen in love with me!",3
RORY,It's not stupid. You're a catch.,3
LANE,"But not his catch, I'm Dave's catch. I've already been caught.",3
RORY,You probably need to be more direct.,3
LANE,That fool. And I can't break up with him or my mom will never let me date. It's gotta come from him. What do I do?,3
RORY,Just a second?,3
JESS,Hey.,3
RORY,Hey.,3
JESS,"Bizarro day, huh?",3
RORY,Wouldn't wanna repeat it.,3
JESS,The inn's still closed?,3
RORY,Just  til tomorrow.,3
JESS,What caused it?,3
RORY,"They're not sure. Something electrical, probably.",3
JESS,That's usually the culprit. Something the matter?,3
RORY,No.,3
JESS,Good.,3
RORY,So how was school?,3
JESS,"Same ol', same ol'.",3
RORY,You're still doing okay?,3
JESS,"Doing my reading, writing, and arithmetic.",3
RORY,"And you're still going, right?",3
JESS,What? Where's this coming from?,3
RORY,There's been speculation.,3
JESS,From who?,3
RORY,My mom asked whether you're going full time to school.,3
JESS,Your mom?,3
RORY,Yeah.,3
JESS,Why's she so interested?,3
RORY,Because you're dating her daughter.,3
JESS,"Oh, great, what else does she think I did? Start the fire, put Phil Spector up to it?",3
RORY,"I told her yes, you were going.",3
JESS,"Well, as they say on the Family Feud, good answer.",3
RORY,"So, I didn't lie to her?",3
JESS,No.,3
RORY,No?,3
JESS,"Look, don't worry, I got it under control.",3
RORY,Jess.,3
JESS,"I'm going enough. I've been picking up some extra shifts here and there, but I'm fine. It's Mickey Mouse stuff anyway. What it takes the others hours to learn, it takes me minutes.",3
RORY,"Well, if you're behind. . .",3
JESS,I'm not behind.,3
RORY,"But if you get behind, I can help you catch up.",3
JESS,Got it covered.,3
RORY,If you say so.,3
JESS,I do.,3
RORY,Okay.,3
JESS,,3
KIM,What's this?,3
LANE,,3
KIM,Why is he here at all?,3
LANE,He came to borrow something. Here.,3
JESS,,3
KIM,Cricket.,3
JESS,,3
LUKE,"Oh, don't do that.",3
LORELAI,Don't do what?,3
LUKE,Don't pull the sheet back after I pull it. I need more for this side.,3
LUKE,You pulled it back again.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, I need it for my side.",3
LUKE,I need it to tuck in.,3
LORELAI,Same here.,3
LUKE,I always tuck it in on this side.,3
LORELAI,Let's tuck it in on both sides.,3
LUKE,You tuck a bed in on both sides?,3
LORELAI,"Yes, and then I slip down into it like I'm in a straitjacket or something.",3
LUKE,"Oh, you must feel right at home there.",3
LORELAI,I so set you up for that.,3
LUKE,"Fine, tuck it in on your side.",3
LORELAI,"You know, I really should take the couch. Me taking the bed doesn't feel right.",3
LUKE,"Oh, now, come on.",3
LORELAI,What?,3
LUKE,You browbeat me in to giving you the bed and pretending you don't want it now isn't working.,3
LORELAI,I'm pretending to try to be polite.,3
LUKE,I'm fine with the couch. You're the one that's exhausted.,3
LORELAI,"You know, I'm actually not.",3
LUKE,Really?,3
LORELAI,"I'm, like, strangely exhilarated. I mean, as awful as what happened today was, I'm happy with how I handled it. You know, you never know how you're gonna react in situations like this until something happens and I think I did pretty well.",3
LUKE,"Yeah, I do, too.",3
LUKE,"Hello? . . .oh, hey, Nicole, hi. . .Yeah, I'm good. . . Oh, not much. There was a fire at the local inn out here and. . .Yeah, the one she works at, yeah. . .Everybody's fine. Yeah, just a lot of chaos for awhile. So how was your thing today? . . . All right, fill me in tomorrow. . . Seven's good. . .Okay. . . Okay, yeah. . .Goodnight. That was Nicole.",3
LORELAI,So I heard. Why didn't you tell her I was here?,3
LUKE,Didn't come up.,3
LORELAI,"You mean, she didn't out of the clear blue and for no reason ask you if I was sleeping over?",3
LUKE,Just didn't seem necessary.,3
LORELAI,"Well, you have nothing to hide here. You just took in a refugee.",3
LUKE,I know there's nothing to hide. It's just that. . .you've kinda become a. . .,3
LORELAI,Become w hat?,3
LUKE,A sore point with me an d Nicole.,3
LORELAI,"What, how?",3
LUKE,"Well, on our first date, I was a little nervous and I wasn't having any luck coming up with topics, so I was just kinda blabbing a lot. And then she ordered extra fries at dinner, so it reminded me of you and I told her a quick story about you and French fries, and that seemed fine. And then later, she ordered a third cup of coffee. . .",3
LORELAI,"Oh, Luke.",3
LUKE,"And I mentioned you and your coffee thing, and I noticed that Nicole kind of reacted a little, and ever since then, she's been a little sensitive to the issue.",3
LORELAI,"Well, of course she is, Luke. You don't talk about another woman on a first date.",3
LUKE,Even if it's just a friend?,3
LORELAI,They don't exist.,3
LUKE,Come on.,3
LORELAI,Not on a first date.,3
LUKE,"No other women exist on a first date, not even my mother?",3
LORELAI,Do you really think talking about your mother on a first date is wise?,3
LUKE,Not really.,3
LORELAI,"You can maybe mention a sister, maybe. And then you move on really, really quickly.",3
LUKE,This is why I hate dating.,3
LORELAI,"Well, unless you wanna be Mountain Man all your life, you've got to abide by the rules and customs. Ooh, sorry, I have to get up super early tomorrow.",3
LUKE,No problem. What time?,3
LORELAI,Six.,3
LUKE,I get up at quarter to five every morning.,3
LORELAI,Why in the world would you get up that early?,3
LUKE,"I don't know, to run my business?",3
LORELAI,"Well, change businesses. Ooh, wow, total déjà vu.",3
LUKE,Really?,3
LORELAI,"It's the alarm clock. I had a dream once that you set eighteen alarm clocks to get me up, which is not a bad way to get me up.",3
LUKE,Where were we?,3
LORELAI,"We were, um, at my house. I got up, I went downstairs for coffee, and you talked to my stomach.",3
LUKE,Why on earth I do that?,3
LORELAI,"Well, because I was pregnant. Twins.",3
LUKE,Mine?,3
LORELAI,"What am I, dream tramp? Of course yours.",3
LUKE,We were married?,3
LORELAI,"Um, yeah. Did I not mention that?",3
LUKE,"No. You know, you shouldn't drink coffee when you're pregnant.",3
LORELAI,"Uh, true.",3
LUKE,It's probably why Rory's a caffeine addict.,3
LORELAI,"Right, you're right.",3
LUKE,Dream go beyond that?,3
LORELAI,"No. Um, you talked to my stomach and then you ki. . .well, no.",3
LUKE,"Oh, okay. Well. . .night.",3
LORELAI,,3
RORY,Luke and Sookie have worked things out.,3
LORELAI,There does seem to be a grudging respect thing going on.,3
SOOKIE,"Get the ricotta fritters started, guys. I wanna serve those first.",3
LUKE,"Hey, we making the Cajun Eggs Benedict again?",3
SOOKIE,"I don't know, we could.",3
LUKE,"Let's do it, it was good.",3
SOOKIE,"Well, the Cajun was all your doing.",3
LUKE,Only because I knocked the cayenne pepper into your hollandaise.,3
SOOKIE,"Hey, how do you think they invented the Reese's cup and penicillin, my friend? We can win the Nobel here.",3
JESS,Morning.,3
LUKE,You're up early.,3
JESS,Gotta catch me that worm. See ya.,3
LUKE,Where you off to?,3
JESS,School.,3
LUKE,This early?,3
JESS,I got a lab project going on. Me and my team are meeting early.,3
LUKE,"Well, have a good day.",3
JESS,If I have a choice. Hey.,3
LORELAI,Good morning.,3
JESS,Talk to you later.,3
RORY,Later.,3
LORELAI,"By the way, your boyfriend snores.",3
RORY,Didn't need to know that.,3
LORELAI,"Hello. . .it is?. . .oh, I love you, I love you. . .thanks. We're open. Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention please. That was just Chief Baker on the phone who told me in that deep sexy voice of his that the inn is officially reopened. Uh, right now it's just me an d the staffers, but soon, very soon, you will have your stuff back and you can go home.",3
FRED,"Thank you, Lorelai. Listen, from our group, we want to give you this.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, well, that's the nicest dead bird I've ever gotten. Thanks, Fred. POE 2: It's from all of us.",3
LORELAI,Right. Thank you Poe Society. Coming Sookie?,3
SOOKIE,"I'm coming. Okay, you need to caramelize the hazelnuts for the brioche French toast, add some M adeira to the pear-poaching liquid and add some chives to the cream for the sheared eggs.",3
LUKE,"Don't burn anything, got it.",3
RORY,I've gotta change for school.,3
LORELAI,"Go, go, we'll see you later.",3
SOOKIE,,3
MICHELorelai,"Ah, here they are.",3
LORELAI,"Hi, Michel. Hi, Chief. Don't we love our chief?",3
SOOKIE,I bet he can beat up all the other chiefs.,3
LORELAI,For sure he can.,3
MICHELorelai,,3
BAKERory,Let me just unlock the door here.,3
LORELAI,"Michel, the first thing I wanna do is get into all the rooms and get all the guests' stuff into the lobby and organized for them to pick up. Sookie, go to the kitchen and let me know what's what. Maybe we can open for dinner. CHIEF",3
BAKERory,Dinner?,3
LORELAI,Yeah. CHIEF,3
BAKERory,Anyone give you a heads up about what's inside?,3
LORELAI,No. CHIEF,3

EMILY,"Richard, please, we are starving!",3
RICHARD,"I will be right there, Emily.",3
EMILY,This is ridiculous.,3
LORELAI,"Mom, relax.",3
EMILY,He woke up this morning and suddenly just had to have this dish that his grandmother would make him.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, we all understand the cravings.",3
RICHARD,It's a family secret.,3
EMILY,"Well, last time I checked, I was family.",3
RORY,"He's having fun, Grandma.",3
EMILY,I saw an open can of cream of mushroom soup. Nothing good can come of that.,3
RICHARD,"Here we are, a treat for the masses.",3
RORY,Smells good.,3
RICHARD,"Oh, this is my favorite thing to eat as a boy. My gran used to make this for me whenever I was feeling a little sad. You know, if my cricket team lost or a girl I fancied turned up her nose at me.",3
LORELAI,"Well, then load me up because there was this really cute chick at the pharmacy today. I used my best material on her and nothing.",3
Posted,05/04/03 07:41,3
EMILY,"Richard, at least let Pina serve it.",3
LORELAI,"No commen t on my lesbian hilarity. My, how far we've come.",3
RICHARD,"Pina will serve tiny, proper servings. Johnny Machete needs to be presented in a heap.",3
RORY,Johnny Machete?,3
EMILY,That's the name of this vile concoction.,3
RORY,It's delicious.,3
LORELAI,It's not bad.,3
EMILY,It's twelve different colors.,3
LORELAI,"Come on, Mom, eat it.",3
EMILY,It looks like someone already did.,3
RICHARD,Emily.,3
EMILY,"I'm sorry. I'm happy you're happy, and to prove it, I will take exactly three bites of this before I throw it out.",3
RICHARD,Thank you.,3
EMILY,You're welcome.,3
RICHARD,"So, good food, good company. Now, let's move onto good conversation. Rory, what is new in your life?",3
RORY,"Well, funny you should mention it. . .",3
LORELAI,Now?,3
RORY,Why not?,3
LORELAI,"Okay. Mom, Dad, we have some really big news.",3
RORY,I got my college acceptance letters back.,3
LORELAI,"Harvard, Princeton, and Yale.",3
RORY,"And after giving it a lot of thought, I have decided. I'm going to Yale.",3
LORELAI,Did you hear that   Yale!,3
RORY,I'm going to Yale!,3
LORELAI,"That's where you went, Dad.",3
RORY,"You liked it, rememb er?",3
EMILY,"Pass the Johnny Machete, please.",3
LORELAI,Pass the. . .,3
RORY,I don't understand. I thought you wanted me to go to Yale.,3
EMILY,"No, we didn't.",3
RICHARD,Absolutely not.,3
EMILY,What gave you that idea?,3
LORELAI,"Mom, Dad, look, I know we've had our differences over where Rory should go to school, but that's behind us now. She's going to Yale, and that's good. Really good.",3
RORY,Nothing but smiles.,3
LORELAI,We're both very happy about it.,3
RORY,Both.,3
LORELAI,Her and me.,3
RORY,She and I.,3
LORELAI,Everybody in this room named Lorelai is over the moon about the  going to Yale.',3
RORY,Which means that everybody else in this room not named Lorelai can be equally over the moon about the  going to Yale.',3
RICHARD,I'm getting the champagne.,3
EMILY,I'm calling the Talbotts.,3
RICHARD,"Oh, make sure you gloat over that dimwitted son of theirs who couldn't even get into Brown.",3
EMILY,She's going to Yale!,3
RICHARD,She's going to Yale!,3
RICHARD,,3
LORELAI,So?,3
TOM,It looks burned.,3
LORELAI,Thank you. How long to make it not looked burned?,3
TOM,"Uh, geez, maybe two  ",3
LORELAI,"Tom, let me help you out. The answer I'm looking for is ten days because that's when I have to get guests back in here again.",3
TOM,"Okay, ten days.",3
LORELAI,Are you lying to me?,3
TOM,What's the answer you're looking for there?,3
LORELAI,"Never mind, just go fast.",3
TOM,"Go fast, huh? Never heard that one before.",3
SOOKIE,"Well, everything's fine in the kitchen. We just have to get the gas line reconnected.",3
LORELAI,How long's that gonna take?,3
SOOKIE,I don't know. The plumber's in there now looking at everything.,3
MICHELorelai,We forgot to call the Rappaports and they showed up.,3
LORELAI,"Oh my God, what did you do?",3
MICHELorelai,"Well, luckily they are not too bright so I convinced them they got their days mixed up and I sent them home.",3
LORELAI,You sent them home? You didn't even try to get them a room somewhere else?,3
MICHELorelai,You're welcome.,3
LORELAI,"Hey Laura, try to track down the Rappaports and see if you can get them into the Bunnyhop Inn. Thanks. Okay, grab a seat and let's get the meeting started.",3
TOBIN,"I'm here, I brought bagels.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, Tobin, great. I'm starving.",3
TOBIN,"Normally I wouldn't think of it, because what bagel stands a chance next to Sookie's magical muffins and scones?",3
SOOKIE,"Oh, Tobin, stop!",3
TOBIN,"Two full pants sizes, my friend, all because of you.",3
MICHELorelai,What is he doing here? He is the night manager   it's day.,3
LORELAI,"Michel, this is an emergency staff meeting, I need him here.",3
MICHELorelai,I told you I cannot be in the same room with him.,3
LORELAI,"It's an hour out of your life, deal with it.",3
TOBIN,Hold it. In case of soot.,3
LORELAI,You're very sweet.,3
TOBIN,"Wait, wait. Let's let the dry cleaners drum up their own business, huh?",3
MICHELorelai,My chair!,3
TOBIN,"Oh, I'm sorry.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, so, should we get a room or what?",3
MICHELorelai,Will you just start your meet ing?,3
LORELAI,All right. Here's the situation.,3
TOBIN,"Excuse me, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,Yeah?,3
TOBIN,"Michel, did you get a bagel?",3
MICHELorelai,I don't want a bagel.,3
TOBIN,Are you sure? They're Kosher.,3
MICHELorelai,I don't eat bagels. Bagels are like glue in your intestines and ensure that everything that enters your body will remain there until you die.,3
SOOKIE,"Ew, shut up.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, let's focus. As you know, the fire pretty much wiped out the dining room and five of the upstairs rooms.",3
LORELAI,"Tobin, are you okay?",3
TOBIN,"I'm sorry, I just. . .I just love this place so much. I've been the night manager here for five years and I've spent so much time w alking these halls, listening for friendly ghosts flying around, playing  ",3
MICHELorelai,"Make a point, bagel boy.",3
TOBIN,"It just hurts me to see it wounded, that's all.",3
LORELAI,"Well, it won't be wounded forever. We will rebuild and we'll be back and better than ever.We just need to keep it going until then. So I need some ideas on what to do.",3
TOBIN,"You know, I was thinking. . .I'm sorry, may I?",3
MICHELorelai,No.,3
LORELAI,Go ahead.,3
TOBIN,"Well, if we could get a celebrity in here, that would generate a lot of publicity.",3
LORELAI,Hm. But how could we get a celebrity in here?,3
TOBIN,I know Tony Randall and Renee Estevez. I'd be happy to put in a call.,3
MICHELorelai,"Okay. Look, I hate to bring this up, especially since   I mean, how do you top Renee Estevez? But we have a small number of rooms, yes?",3
LORELAI,Yes.,3
MICHELorelai,"And the lobby's fine, and Sookie can make certain things at home   muffins, baked goods, jams, et cetera.",3
LORELAI,So?,3
MICHELorelai,"So that's breakfast, and we have beds, and if we add some free wine and cheese around five in the afternoon. . .",3
LORELAI,"Uh, no. We're not becoming a bed and breakfast. Who's next?",3
MICHELorelai,You're being stubborn.,3
LORELAI,Bed and breakfasts are cutesy and annoying.,3
SOOKIE,It forces people to mingle.,3
LORELAI,I do not support the mingling.,3
MICHELorelai,Adding a little gimmic k will be an incentive for people to keep their reservations.,3
TOBIN,"You know what, I hate to say it, not being a B&B man myself, but Michel is making sense.",3
MICHELorelai,Get off my side immed iately.,3
LORELAI,"All right, I'll consider it.",3
MICHELorelai,"Sure, if he says it, you will consider it.",3
TOM,I gotta show you something.,3

TOM,"No, it's great. You're gonna be thrilled, really. Warm up, cartwheels are coming.",3
LORELAI,Keep talking. Be right back.,3
TOBIN,"Excuse me, Lorelai? Listen, I know you're crazed right now, but I also remembered that your birthday is coming up on Friday, and well, I got you a little something.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, you didn't have to do that.",3
TOBIN,It's very small.,3
LORELAI,"Tobin, I love candles.",3
TOBIN,"And it's scented, cappuccino.",3
LORELAI,"God, that smells great.",3
TOBIN,I'm really glad you like it.,3
LORELAI,"I do, thanks.",3
TOBIN,"And listen, I'm the night manager here and I'm very proud to be the night manager, but with everything so wacky crazy around here right now, if you need some extra help during the day, please call me.",3

RORY,Mom.,3
LORELAI,What?,3
RORY,Luke cannot sweep our chimney.,3
LORELAI,Why not?,3
RORY,Because you need to be a chimney sweep to sweep a chimney.,3
LORELAI,"Please. If d*ck van d*ke can do it, so can Luke.",3
RORY,Luke is going to be very sorry he ever made this offer to you.,3
LORELAI,"Hey, Luke has given me five free hours of handyman work for my birthday for the last five years.",3
RORY,And you have grossly exploited that gift every year for the past four years.,3
LORELAI,"Well, I need to make up for that first year where I didn't milk it like I should've.",3
RORY,The spirit of giving is completely lost on you.,3
LORELAI,"But the spirit of getting is alive and well and it wants its chimney swept. Ooh, put down laundry, too.",3
RORY,"Fine, then can he also build me another bookshelf?",3
LORELAI,I've never been prouder of you than I am right at this moment.,3
RORY,And tell him to paint little flowers on it.,3
LORELAI, Cause he's so good with the florals.,3

PARIS,I've been very bored.,3
RORY,When are you coming back to school?,3
PARIS,My parents return tomorrow. I think my mom's bringing home a new face.,3

RORY,You are kidding me.,3
PARIS,"She has to sleep on her back for a month, otherwise her face will flatten like a crepe.",3

LORELAI,You're not funny.,3
RORY,"Miss Patty and Babette wanted to hire these two hot guys to carry you around all day and feed you Bon-Bons, and Kirk wanted to hire the Red Hot Chili Peppers to play a concert in the square, but I said,  Hey, please respect the lady's wishes. She deserves that at her age. ",3

RORY,That's right.,3
FRAN,Would you like butter cream or whipped cream frosting on that?,3
RORY,Can you do both?,3
FRAN,That's a lot of frosting.,3
RORY,"I know, but it's my mom's favorite part. Once we tried to make a cake entirely out of frosting, which turned out to be better in theory than in actual execution.",3
FRAN,"Well, both frostings it is then. What time do you want to pick it up?",3
RORY,Miss Patty will pick it up around five.,3
FRAN,"All right, you're all set.",3

RORY,What?,3
LANE,"Well, apparently, the world's largest pizza was 122 feet, 8 inches.",3
RORY,What?,3
LANE,It says it right there.,3
RORY,"Well, obviously we can't do that.",3
LANE,Obviously.,3
RORY,"So, then, we'll have to make it the largest pizza in Connecticut.",3
LANE,"Actually, Litchfield made one last year that was 98 feet.",3
RORY,Pete said the biggest they could do was a twelve footer.,3
LANE,Maybe you could make her the world's biggest something else.,3
RORY,Like what?,3
LANE,I don't know. Taco?,3
RORY,"I think the world's biggest taco would be a little difficult to serve, don't you?",3
LANE,"Well, it would definitely be more of a commit ment.",3
RORY,We'll just have to tell her it's the world's biggest pizza.,3
LANE,Lie to her on her birthday?,3
RORY,"It's for her own good. So, how's the music selection coming?",3
LANE,"Good. I've decided to choose one song from each year in Lorelai's life. I'm almost done, though I've hit a snag in 1974.",3
RORY,Bad year?,3
LANE,It's making the year of the Macarena look inspired.,3
RORY,"Hey, can you stash this at your house  til the party? It's just favors and stuff.",3

RORY,You looked it up?,3
JESS,Yeah.,3

RORY,,3
TAYLORory,I'd like the wording to be a little harsher.,3
NICOLE,"Taylor, it already says that if Aunt Tilly's Taffy delivers even two hours late, they forfeit all payment for that particular shipment and are liable for any loss of income that may result from that late delivery. It's pretty extreme.",3
TAYLORory,"Well, it may seem extreme, but these candy people are shifty characters.",3
NICOLE,Why don't we leave the wording like it is for now and see how things go? We can always get tougher later if necessary.,3
LUKE,"Yeah, you can send over a couple of Oompa Loompas to kick the crap out of Aunt Tilly.",3
TAYLORory,Are you still dating him?,3
NICOLE,"Yes, I am.",3
TAYLORory,Why?,3
NICOLE,"Oh, Taylor.",3

LUKE,No.,3
TAYLORory,I'm not talking to you.,3
LUKE,It's my lucky day. Is he done?,3

LUKE,"So, listen, after I dispose of Taylor's body, are we hitting a movie tonight?",3
NICOLE,"Yeah, we are.",3
LUKE,Okay.,3
NICOLE,"Uh, Luke, could you sit for a second, please?",3
LUKE,I could.,3

NICOLE,My parents are coming into town and I am going to have lunch with them and I thought maybe you'd like to join me.,3
LUKE,Join you?,3
NICOLE,What do you say?,3
LUKE,"It's not that I don't wanna meet your parents, it's just that I haven't met any parents for a long time.",3
NICOLE,"Well, you don't have to. I'm just giving you the option.",3
JESS,"Jeez, man, just meet her parents already.",3
LUKE,Do you mind?,3
JESS,So what if they hate you? You've been there before.,3
NICOLE,"You know what, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to put you on the spot.",3
LUKE,"I'm not on the spot. Really, I'm completely off the spot. I'm spotless. Uh, what time's the lunch?",3

MADELINE,Yes.,3
LOUISE,And why are you going there?,3
MADELINE,It's the one that took me.,3
LOUISE,But why'd you apply?,3
MADELINE,I needed a fallback option.,3
LOUISE,"Well, fall back, baby, right into some big mama's loving arms.",3
MADELINE,"Ooh, how depressing. Let's talk about you, did you decide?",3
LOUISE,Last night.,3

MADELINE,You had it done.,3
LOUISE,Finally.,3
PARIS,I did not have it done.,3
RORY,Did you fall?,3
PARIS,"No, I didn't fall. I had it pierced.",3
MADELINE,You what?,3
LOUISE,Oh my God.,3
RORY,Why would you do that?,3
PARIS,Because you told me to go out and do something crazy.,3
RORY,"Yes, but I meant have some ic e cream, go see three movies, buy a new purse. I didn't mean go poke a third hold in your nose.",3
PARIS,"Well, I didn't buy a new purse, I pierced my nose. And within an hour of having it done, my nose swelled up to four times its normal size, blocking all nasal passage, making it impossible to breathe. I went to the emergency room, where they pried the thing out of my nose and shot me up with antibiotics. I spent the night with an ice pack strapped to my face.",3
RORY,"Oh, Paris.",3
PARIS,It seems that I was allergic to the crap metal hoop that I paid $19.95 to have jammed into my nose.,3
LOUISE,Did you take a picture?,3
PARIS,"No, Louise, I did not take a picture. I was a little busy trying to get air to my brain cells, a burden you've not yet faced.",3
RORY,"Paris, I'm so sorry. I . . . . .I didn't. . . Hello?",3
PETE,"Rorino, good, I caught ya. Okay, there's a bit of a design flaw in the pizza here.",3
RORY,What kind of design flaw?,3
PETE,I'm a little concerned that the crust is not gonna be able to support all the toppings we talked about. We might need to put in a second crust.,3
RORY,A second crust?,3
PETE,"About three-quarters of the way in, sort of like a retaining wall.",3
RORY,What about just making the crust thicker?,3
PETE,"Okay, we're brainstorming, I got it. A thicker crust, a thicker crust, that might do it. Uh, let me noodle around with that for awhile and get back to you.",3
RORY,Okay. Bye Pete.,3

LUKE,What's wrong with the garbage disposal?,3
LORELAI,It's not disposing.,3
LUKE,Next.,3
LORELAI,You're so good!,3
LUKE,Did you ever consider the possibility of just pulling the spoon out yourself?,3
LORELAI,"I did consider it, yes. Do you wanna start upstairs or down?  Cause there's actually more to do upstairs this time for some reason.",3
LUKE,What'd you just do?,3
LORELAI,What?,3
LUKE,You put the cookie down.,3
LORELAI,Yeah.,3
LUKE,"You ate the cookie, and then you took a cookie out of the box and put it where the cookie you just ate was.",3
LORELAI,Yeah.,3
LUKE,"Well, that's nuts.",3
LORELAI,"Rory made this for me, I don't wanna ruin it.",3
LUKE,Then why'd you eat the cookie?,3
LORELAI, Cause I wanted a Mallomar.,3
LUKE,But why didn't you just eat one out of the box?,3
LORELAI, Cause this one was right here. The box was all the way in the cupboard.,3
LUKE,But you had to go to the cupboard to get the box to replace the cookie you ate off the table.,3
LORELAI,So?,3
LUKE,"Looking at the list now. Okay, stairs, gutters, da-duh-da-duh-da, electrical outlet. Which one?",3
LORELAI,In the bathroom.,3
LUKE,By the sink or by the bathtub?,3

LORELAI,"Yeah, I think it's great.",3
LUKE,"Yeah, I do, too. I should get started upstairs. By the way. . .",3
LORELAI,What?,3
LUKE,You were right about Jess.,3
LORELAI,What about Jess?,3
LUKE,He's not going to school.,3
LORELAI,Are you sure?,3
LUKE,"Yup. I watched him head right toward the school and when he thought no one was watching him, he got in his car and drove off. So I got in my truck and followed him.",3
LORELAI,Where?,3
LUKE,To Wal-Mart.,3
LORELAI,Oh.,3
LUKE,He's been lying to me this whole time.,3
LORELAI,What are you gonna do?,3
LUKE,"I'm gonna tell him that I know what he's been doing, remind him that we had an agreement, that he's supposed to go to school, that he's supposed to graduate from school, and then. . .I'm gonna tell him I know what he's been doing.",3

JACKSON,What do you think you're doing?,3
RORY,"Oh, well, I'm trying to transport all the sodas for the party in one trip, which seemed a little silly when I first come up with the idea and it's rapidly growing in its stupidity.",3
JACKSON,"You know, I never took you for being thoughtless, but I guess I was wrong.",3
RORY,What are you talking about? I got the sugarless Red Bull just like you like.,3

JACKSON,"The woman is a gourmet chef and Lorelai's best friend in the world, and you don't include her in this?",3
RORY,But Sookie's an artist   pizzas didn't really seem to be her thing.,3
JACKSON,"Everything's her thing, young lady.",3
RORY,"Jackson, I swear, I would never purposely hurt Sookie. Besides, it's not the world's largest pizza. It's not even the tri-county area's largest pizza.",3
JACKSON,"I have a sobbing pregnant woman at home, which is not unusual, except this time I didn't cause it!",3
RORY,"I'm so, so sorry.",3
JACKSON,"And by the way, there wouldn't happen to be vegetables on that pizza, would there?",3
RORY,Well. . .,3

RORY,And a darn good one at that.,3
JACKSON,"Yet, I don't rememb er a call asking me to handle the vegetables. Was there a call? Did I just miss it? Was I out?",3

RICHARD,"I thought so. Anyhow, a little while ago, I got a letter from a lawyer who is representing the investment group informing me that the government is building a road right through the middle of your investment.",3
LORELAI,Sad.,3
RICHARD,Which means that the complex has been sold and all the investors will be receiving a check.,3
LORELAI,Happy.,3
RICHARD,Since you are one of the investors. . .,3
LORELAI,I get a check?,3
RICHARD,You get a check.,3
LORELAI,Wow! That's. . . Seventy-five thousand dollars?,3
RICHARD,"Yes, it is.",3
LORELAI,I get seventy-five thousand dollars for being born?,3
RICHARD,I thought it would be a pleasant surprise.,3
LORELAI,This is seventy-five thousand dollars. Seventy-five. . .do you have a pen?,3
RICHARD,"Why, yes, I do.",3
LORELAI,"Seventy-five thousand dollars. Seventy-five thousand dollars. Oh my God, that's like 150 pairs of Jimmy Choos.",3
RICHARD,What are Jimmy Choos?,3
LORELAI,Shoes.,3
RICHARD,"150 pairs, that's it?",3
LORELAI,"Dad, they're Jimmy Choos.",3
RICHARD,"For seventy-five thousand dollars, you should be able to buy at least three or four hundred pairs of shoes.",3
LORELAI,Not Jimmy Choos.,3
RICHARD,But that's ridiculous. You are not going to spend seventy-five thousand dollars on Jimmy Choos when you could buy four hundred pairs of less prestigious but I'm sure equally stylish shoes. You will shop around first. Is that clear?,3
LORELAI,"Yes, sir.",3
RICHARD,"All right, then. It's settled.",3
LORELAI,"Listen, Dad, this money isn't, um. . .",3
RICHARD,Isn't what?,3
LORELAI,"It isn't some kind of gift, is it?",3
RICHARD,Gift?,3
LORELAI,"Like a birthday gift. Because if it is, it's too much and I can't  ",3
RICHARD,"This isn't a gift. I made this investment in your name. You received a check, that's the way these things work. Legally, I'm obligated to give you that. This isn't charity or generosity, it is the law.",3
LORELAI,It's the law that I get to keep seventy-five thousand dollars.,3
RICHARD,,3
LORELAI,We could buy a boat.,3
RORY,"We could, but why?",3
LORELAI,Because rich people always have a boat.,3
RORY,We could park it in the front yard.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, like white trash rich people.",3
RORY,"God, this is amazing. No more clipping coupons.",3
LORELAI,No more picking loose change up from the ground. No more driving around looking for cheap gas.,3
RORY,Which totally defeats the purpose since you wind up using more gas looking for the cheap gas.,3
LORELAI,Seventy-five thousand dollars. I feel so rich. And suddenly in complete agreement with everything Bush has to say.,3
LORELAI,I'll get it.,3
RORY,No!,3
LORELAI,"Ah, more secret birthday calls.",3
RORY,Not everything is about you. It could be Jess.,3
LORELAI,It's about me.,3
RORY,It could be Lane.,3
LORELAI,It's about me.,3
RORY,"It could be Paris, it could be Madeline, it could be Louise, it could be a myriad of other people wanting only to talk to me ab out me.",3
LORELAI,It's about me.,3
RORY,Hello?,3
PETE,"Rory, we got a big problemo.",3
RORY,"What's the matter, Pete?",3
PETE,"We did a trial run of the pizza. You know, just wanna make sure everything was right there for the big day, you know.",3
RORY,I appreciate that.,3
PETE,"So we made a trial pizza, and Kirk built a pizza rack on top of his car, you with me?",3
RORY,"Like a bad habit, Pete.",3
PETE,"So as Kirk's putting the pizza on the rack, the thing collapses, the pizza slips, long story short   Kirk has got some severe cheese burns.",3
RORY,"Oh my God, is he all right?",3
KIRK,Ow.,3
PETE,Who knows? The point is. . .,3
KIRK,Oh.,3
PETE,I think the pizza needs to be cheeseless.,3
RORY,What?,3
PETE,And possibly sauceless.,3
RORY,Pete.,3
PETE,"The thing's a hazard, babe.",3
RORY,"Pete, did it ever occur to you that the problem may not be the pizza, it may be Kirk?",3
PETE,Did not occur to me.,3
RORY,"Well, it should have.",3
PETE,Okay.,3
RORY,"The pizza has to have cheese and sauce, otherwise, it's not a pizza. It's bread.",3
PETE,"Okay, look, if you're gonna insist on the cheese and the sauce, you're gonna have to provide the transportation yourself.",3
RORY,"Fine, Pete, I will figure something out.",3
PETE,"Roger wilco, senorita.",3
LORELAI,Who was it?,3
RORY,Astrid from school. She's leaving for Europe for a week and she wants me to take notes and email her everything. She's afraid she's gonna fall behind.,3
LORELAI,,3
JESS,Hey.,3
LUKE,Hey. You're home late.,3
JESS,Traffic.,3
LUKE,"Traffic, right, okay. So, you hungry?",3
JESS,I'm meet ing Rory.,3
LUKE,Want me to make you guys some sandwiches?,3
JESS,So we can brown bag it on our date? I don't think so.,3
LUKE,Just offering. How was work?,3
JESS,"The cleaned-up version of The Eminem Show seems to be selling pretty well, so the world is basically coming to an end.",3
LUKE,"So listen, I, um, wanna talk to you about something.",3
JESS,Talk.,3
LUKE,Could you stop grooming for just a second please?,3
JESS,I'm already late.,3
LUKE,"Look, I was doing some thinking about your situation.",3
JESS,My situation?,3
LUKE,"Yeah, you know, you're working here, you're working at Wal-Mart, you're dating Rory, going to school. It just seems like a lot. You ever worry that if a bird flies into your head it might never get out again?",3
JESS,I've got everything under control.,3
LUKE,"Yeah, I'm sure you do. I just thought maybe I could make things a little easier.",3
JESS,How?,3
LUKE,"Well, I could, uh, give you a raise at the diner.",3
JESS,A raise?,3
LUKE,"Yeah. And maybe help out with some of the, you know, bigger money burdens, like your car insurance.",3
JESS,Why would you wanna do that?,3
LUKE,So you can quit your job at Wal-Mart.,3
JESS,No way.,3
LUKE,"But you'd still be making money, and this way, you'd get to spend more time on Rory and school.",3
JESS,I'm fine.,3
LUKE,"Jess, come on.",3
JESS,No.,3
LUKE,"Jess, just take the deal.",3
JESS,I have to change.,3
LUKE,I know you're not going to school.,3
JESS,What?,3
LUKE,I saw you get in your car and drive off.,3
JESS,You spying on me?,3
LUKE,You lied to me!,3
JESS,"Once in awhile I take an extra shift, it's nothing.",3
LUKE,"You have to go to school, Jess.",3
JESS,I go enough.,3
LUKE,What does that mean?,3
JESS,"It means I go enough. It's public school. My history teacher is also the football coach, get the picture?",3
LUKE,"Jess, we had a deal. You go to school, you graduate.",3
JESS,I know. Relax. I got it all under control. I have to change.,3
LUKE,,3
LORELAI,"That's right, breakfast is included. Then at five, we invite all the guests to the lobby for complimentary wine and cheese and mingling. . . Yes, it is kind of like a B&B. . . Okay, great. We'll see you and Sweetie then. Bye.",3
TOBIN,"Any thoughts? So, as you know, we have to get this place up and running as quickly as possible for as little money as possible. So last night I pulled out the old Time Life series, and I have to admit, there's some pretty terrific ideas in here. For example, we can putty up the cracks in the drywall and then give the lower part of the wall a good coat of paint. Then we can take a strip of wallpaper, put it around the top, thus creating sort of a border, if you will. Also, I gathered up all the broken China from the dining room because I read here in Martha that chipped teacups make great votive holders, and we all know, when in doubt, it's candles, candles, candles, right? So I cleaned them up, filled them with tealights, and I think they look terrific. Oh, the pieces that were too far gone to save, I just smashed them up and used the pieces to make this nice picture frame.",3
LORELAI,"Ah, that's a great idea, Tobin, really.",3
MICHELorelai,"Uh, Lorelai. I have a little something for you.",3
LORELAI,For me?,3
MICHELorelai,"Yes. I wasn't sure it would get here in time since I ordered it from Madrid, but thank God it made it. Happy birthday.",3
LORELAI,You bought me a p resent?,3
MICHELorelai,Yes.,3
LORELAI,You've never bought me a p resent.,3
MICHELorelai,"I have, too.",3
LORELAI,Not once in the five years I've known you have you ever  ,3
MICHELorelai,"Just open up the bag, please.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, Michel, it's beautiful.",3
MICHELorelai,"Yes, well, I wanted it to be special, you know. Not just some knick- knack you could pick up at the supermarket or the car wash.",3
LORELAI,"Well, it's great. I love it. I must say, I feel very spoiled. A beautiful day book, cappuccino candle.",3
TOBIN,"Oh, that reminds me, I got you something else.",3
LORELAI,"What? Tobin, you already gave me a gift.",3
TOBIN,"No, that was a pre-gift.",3
MICHELorelai,A what?,3
TOBIN,Hold on. Why don't you scooch just a little bit for me?,3
LORELAI,"Tobin, this is too much.",3
TOBIN,"Yes, it is, but I saw it and it just screamed Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, well. . .God, this is exciting. I love my birthday.",3
TOBIN,I hope it fits.,3
MICHELorelai,Fits?,3
LORELAI,"Tobin, it's amazing.",3
TOBIN,That is the jacket that Joe Strummer wore during the 1979 Pearl Harbor tour.,3
LORELAI,No.,3
TOBIN,Yes.,3
MICHELorelai,Who is Joe Strummer ?,3
LORELAI,Tell me you're kidding.,3
MICHELorelai,Who is Joe Strummer ?,3
LORELAI,You did not get me this.,3
MICHELorelai,Is he a Hell's Angel man?,3
TOBIN,Joe Strummer is from The Clash.,3
LORELAI,The Clash is a band.,3
TOBIN,And a band is a  ,3
MICHELorelai,I know what a band is.,3
LORELAI,"He just died, and Rory and Lane have been in mourning for months, and now I have his jacket. And, oh my God, this is by far the coolest thing I have ever gotten. God. Oh, smell it, it smells like Joe.",3
MICHELorelai,"Well, this is wonderful, to smell like a dead guy. You'll have to beat them off with a stick.",3
TOBIN,"And there's a letter of authenticity in the bag, and a picture of Joe wearing the jacket, and also, they threw in a beret just for the heck of it.",3
LORELAI,"Tobin, you are getting a hug!",3
TOBIN,"Well, I'd fight it, but what's the point, right?",3
MICHELorelai,I have to run an errand.,3
LORELAI,"Why, where you going?",3
MICHELorelai,Just be here when I get back.,3
LORELAI,,3
LEAHY,"Nicole, you're being  ",3
NICOLE,I am not being stubborn. MR.,3
LEAHY,,3
LEAHY,"Luke, would you like a blini?",3
LUKE,"No, thank you. MR.",3
LEAHY,"When you sign up to become a surrogate mother, you enter into a business agreement, and the rules of business should apply. You as a lawyer should understand that.",3
NICOLE,"As a lawyer, I do understand that. As a human being, I also understand that when a woman's alone   MR.",3
LEAHY,Here we go.,3
NICOLE,,3
LEAHY,I could get you some cheese.,3
NICOLE,You cannot force a mother to give up her child. MR.,3
LEAHY,"If she signed a paper saying,  On April the 12th I am giving birth and whatever comes out, I'm handing to you. . . ",3
NICOLE,What a lovely way to put that. MR.,3
LEAHY,,3
LEAHY,"They always do this. They pick a subject and they argue until dinner, then they call a truce and they pick it back up for dessert. I could get you some nuts.",3
NICOLE,"Okay, enough. I don't wanna argue with you anymore. MR.",3
LEAHY,"What can I do with her, Luke? I ask you.",3
LUKE,,3
LEAHY,"So Luke, I feel like we've been ignoring you.",3
LUKE,,3
LEAHY,Nicole told us you've never been married.,3
NICOLE,,3
LEAHY,"Hush, sweetheart. You just sit there and pretend to be ashamed of us.",3
LUKE,,3
LEAHY,"But someday, maybe, right? Marriage, children?",3
NICOLE,,3
LEAHY,Because there is nothing more wonderful than marriage.,3
NICOLE,,3
LEAHY,"And then children. Well, there's nothing more rewarding than children. You just can't imagine until you've been there. MR.",3
LEAHY,,3
LEAHY,The whole experience is like the most fabulous roller coaster ride you can imagine. From the time they're born to that first step. The first word. The first time they hug you. The first time they pick out their own outfits.,3
LUKE,"The first time they tell you they're going to school and then you follow them, and they get in their car and drive to Wal-Mart. MR.",3
LEAHY,Wal-Mart?,3

LEAHY,Oh dear.,3

RORY,Hey guys.,3
PETE,"Rory, good, just the lady we're looking for. We have a plan.",3
RORY,"Good,  cause I've got a check.",3
PETE,We've solved the problem of transporting the big pizza thing.,3
KIRK,I was of little help since I'm currently in excruciating pain.,3
PETE,"Instead of this whole one huge pizza concept, we're gonna do a hundred little pizzas all sitting next to each other.",3
RORY,What?,3
JOE,Like a pizza doily.,3
RORY,I don't want a pizza doily.,3
PETE,"Okay, less a doily, more of a collage.",3
RORY,I don't want a pizza collage either.,3
JOE,"Hey guys, I got another idea. How about we put the pizzas together, and then put pepperonis over the open spots.",3
PETE,"So it looks like one big pizza, tricky.",3
RORY,"Okay, hold on.",3
JOE,Or we could put cheese over the holes.,3
KIRK,Please don't say the C- word.,3
RORY,Guys.,3
PETE,Cheese might fall through the holes.,3
JOE,We can use slices.,3
PETE,That'll work.,3
RORY,That will not work!,3
PETE,"Hey, Rory.",3
RORY,"No. Now you three listen to me. We agreed that this was going to be the world's largest pizza. That was the concept. Now I realize it can't be the world's largest pizza because that pizza was insane, but it is still going to be large. Very large. Crazy large.",3
PETE,But we  ,3
RORY,"No buts! That was the concept   get back to the concept! This is not Gangs of New York now with Cameron Diaz. This is Gangs of New York twenty years ago with Meryl Streep as Scorsese originally imagined it. Come back, refocus, remember the goal. Am I making myself clear?",3
JOE,Cameron Diaz is hot.,3
RORY,"Not the point, Joe.",3
JOE,"Okay, jeez.",3
RORY,"Now tonight is my mother's birthday party and the whole town is going to be there and they are expecting music, favors, and a really large pizza and they will not be disappointed. I don't care how you do it, just do it!",3
KIRK,,3
LUKE,"I really am sorry, Nicole. Your parents must think I'm a lunatic.",3
NICOLE,"No, I don't think lunatic was one of the words they used. But they have a very extensive vocabulary, so there may just not have been time.",3
LUKE,It's the first time I meet them and I just. . .Jess was driving me crazy and. . .,3
NICOLE,I know this. I told them this.,3
LUKE,"I swear, when they come back into town, I will do better.",3
JESS,I'm going to school.,3
NICOLE,They may not be back in town for several months.,3
LUKE,Whenever.,3
NICOLE,Whenever? So I can make another lunch date with my parents even though it's several months away?,3
LUKE,"Sure, make it.",3
NICOLE,"Okay, I'll make it.",3
LUKE,"Tell them I've gotten some med ication, I'm much better now.",3
NICOLE,I'll do that.,3
JESS,Get off the phone!,3
LUKE,What?,3
JESS,"I need the phone, get off the phone!",3
LUKE,What's the matter?,3
JESS,Someone stole my car.,3
LUKE,"Nicole, I'm gonna have to call you back. What do you mean somebody stole your car?",3
JESS,I parked it right around the corner and now it's gone.,3
LUKE,Why would you park it around the corner?,3
JESS,Because that's where I parked it. How the hell can the police department have an answering machine?,3
LUKE,"Look, let's just calm down.",3
JESS,Who would steal that car? It hardly ran.,3
LUKE,"Well, you know these chop shops, they can make a buck out of anything.",3
JESS,I am gonna k*ll whoever did this. I'm gonna find them and k*ll them.,3
LUKE,"Listen, just go on over to school, I'll take care of anything.",3
JESS,"No, I gotta talk to the cops.",3
LUKE,"I'll do that, go. You know, you don't wanna be late to your first class, right?",3
JESS,"Well, yeah, but  ",3
LUKE,"I mean, you were planning on going to school, right?",3
JESS,Right.,3
LUKE,"Okay, well, then just walk on over to school and I'll take care of the rest.",3

LORELAI,"Wait, aren't I supposed to blow them out?",3
EMILY,"Oh, Teresa can do that.",3
LORELAI,"Mom, it's tradition for the person whose name is on the cake to do the blowing.",3
EMILY,"Oh, I'm sorry, I thought only children liked to do that. Should we bring it back out and relight it?",3
LORELAI,No.,3
RICHARD,"Well, would you like to make a wish and blow out the tapers?",3
LORELAI,Why am I being mocked on my birthday?,3
RORY,Because that's the Gilmore way.,3
LORELAI,Huh.,3
EMILY,"Let's move into the living room for our dessert, shall we?",3
LORELAI,Let's shall.,3
LORELAI,How're we doing on time?,3
RORY,We've got time for cake.,3
LORELAI,Are you sure?  Cause I don't wanna miss the fancy party you're throwing me.,3
RORY,"Don't worry, it's not that fancy.",3
EMILY,What are the two of you whispering about?,3
LORELAI,Nothing.,3
RICHARD,Champagne?,3
LORELAI,Trying to get me drunk so I forget that you wouldn't let me blow out my own candles?,3
EMILY,"Oh, dear, is this going to be another one of those stories that you tell people for the rest of your life like the bunny story?",3
LORELAI,"His name w as Murray, Mom.",3
RICHARD,"Oh, Emily, you had to bring that up.",3
LORELAI,How could you think I wouldn't notice you gave away my rabbit?,3
EMILY,Because you were four and terrified of the thing.,3
LORELAI,"I was not terrified, I simply respected his space.",3
RICHARD,You slept in the maid's room for a week.,3
LORELAI,I wonder where Murray is now.,3
RICHARD,"In a shoebox somewhere, I assume.",3
RORY,Grandpa.,3

LORELAI,35th.,3

LORELAI,You're doing the math?,3
RICHARD,"Right, sorry. To Lorelai on her 35th birthday.",3
RORY,"Hear, hear.",3
LORELAI,"Thank you for the toast, thank you for the dinner, and, uh, in the spirit of the evening   Mom, I have something for you.",3
EMILY,For me? It's not my birthday.,3
LORELAI,"I know, but here.",3
RICHARD,Oh.,3
EMILY,What is this?,3
LORELAI,It's from Murray. It's taken him this long to write it partially  cause of the hurt and pain and partially  cause he has paws.,3
EMILY,What is this?,3
LORELAI,That is what I owe you.,3
EMILY,What you owe me?,3
LORELAI,"For Rory's school. I promised you I'd pay you back and now I have, every cent. Thank you again for helping us out. There's no way Rory would be going to Yale if it wasn't for this money, if it wasn't for you.",3
EMILY,You're welcome.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, so. . .",3
EMILY,You must be very relieved.,3
LORELAI,Excuse me?,3
EMILY,"Your debt is paid, you owe us nothing.",3
LORELAI,"Well, yeah.",3
EMILY,You don't need us anymore.,3
LORELAI,"Um, I didn't say  ",3
EMILY,"You don't have to deal with us. You don't have to come over for Friday night dinners. It all works out beautifully, doesn't it?",3
LORELAI,"This isn't about that, Mom.",3
EMILY,Oh no?,3
LORELAI,"No, I owed you money and I paid you back.",3
EMILY,I don't want it.,3
LORELAI,I can't believe you're mad that I'm paying you back.,3
EMILY,"I'm not mad, I just think it's extremely unkind of you to use this occasion to inform me you won't be coming over anymore.",3
LORELAI,I didn't say that.,3
EMILY,This says that!,3
LORELAI,"Mom, let me as k you something   wouldn't you rather we came over here because we wanted to, not because of some threat you're holding over our heads?",3
EMILY,"Oh, and you would come here voluntarily?",3
LORELAI,I always said I would pay you back. This is not a surprise.,3
EMILY,"No, it certainly isn't.",3
LORELAI,"I was trying to do a good thing here. When Dad gave me the money, one of the first things that jumped into my head was to -",3
EMILY,When Dad gave you the money? When Dad gave her the money?,3
RICHARD,"Now, Emily  ",3
EMILY,You gave her this?,3
RICHARD,It was her money.,3
LORELAI,"It was from that investment, Mom.",3
RICHARD,I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out of this.,3
LORELAI,Why are you mad at me?,3
RICHARD,I told you not to tell your mother about that money.,3
LORELAI,When did you tell me that?,3
RICHARD,At lunch.,3
LORELAI,You did not.,3
RICHARD,"I did, too.",3
LORELAI,"Dad, I swear you didn't tell me not to tell Mom.",3
RICHARD,"Why do you think I met you in the day at a restaurant, Lorelai? Think.",3
LORELAI,I  ,3
EMILY,"You kept this from me, Richard?",3
RICHARD,I knew you would be upset.,3
EMILY,You lied to me.,3
RICHARD,I had to give it to her. I was legally obligated.,3
EMILY,You're also legally obligated to your wife.,3
LORELAI,Mom  ,3
EMILY,Don't you talk to me!,3
RICHARD,"Now, you're overreacting.",3
EMILY,Don't you talk to me eit her!,3
LORELAI,Don't be mad at Dad.,3
RICHARD,Stay out of this!,3
LORELAI,I just  ,3
RICHARD,"Well, don't!",3
LORELAI,"Mom, please. Just because I gave you this money doesn't mean we're never gonna come over here again. We will come over. Maybe not every week, but there will be the occasional Friday night dinners.",3
EMILY,"No, there won't.",3
RORY,Grandma  ,3

RICHARD,,3
LORELAI,"You're quiet. I know they were upset, hon, but trust me, they'll calm down.",3
RORY,Why did you do that?,3
LORELAI,Excuse me?,3
RORY,Just giving them that check like that.,3
LORELAI,"Rory, I borrowed that money.",3
RORY,"I know you did, but you had to have known that they'd get upset. You had to know that Grandma would take it personally.",3
LORELAI,"Well, what would you have me do, not pay them back?",3
RORY,Maybe.,3
LORELAI,Maybe?,3
RORY,"Well, they didn't want the money back.",3
LORELAI,It's not the point.,3
RORY,"Well, it's kind of the point.",3
LORELAI,"No, Rory, it's not the point at all.",3
RORY,"They were throwing you a party, Mom.",3
LORELAI,"Sorry, did I miss something? Did I dance around saying  nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah  when I gave her the check?",3
RORY,No.,3
LORELAI,"Did, did I not thank her   genuinely thank her for everything?",3
RORY,Yes.,3
LORELAI,Did I not credit your getting into Yale with them giving us that money?,3
RORY,"Yes, but  ",3
LORELAI,"Unh uh, no buts. Listen Rory, I'm not sure if you're aware of how hard it has been for me these past three years to be indebted to my parents. I decided a long time ago that I was gonna live my life without their help, but I went to them and I took their money and I'm not sorry I did, it was the right thing for you, but I don't need their help anymore.",3
RORY,"Fine, but you don't have to just throw it in their faces like that.",3
LORELAI,,3
RORY,I just think you could've done it differently.,3
LORELAI,How?,3
RORY,I don't know.,3
LORELAI,Take a shot.,3
RORY,I don't know.,3
LORELAI,"Rory, my relationship with my parents is very different from your relationship with them. You only know the warm and fuzzy Richard and Emily, and I only want you to know the warm and fuzzy Richard and Emily because they're your grandparents and they love you, but I have a different history with them and it was not all warm and it was definitely not all fuzzy. So do not judge me for repaying a loan that I always intended to repay, that I told them from the beginning I would repay, that I had to repay. I will not let them ma ke me feel guilty for doing that and I will not let you make me feel guilty for doing that either.",3
RORY,I'm sorry.,3
LORELAI,It's okay.,3

RORY,The world's largest pizza. Almost.,3

LORELAI,"Oh, I know! How about . . .no.",3
RORY,"No, no, you can't keep doing that. You can't just start a thought and then say no. Finish them or don't start them at all.",3
LORELAI,You're very totalitarian today.,3
RORY,"No, it just drives me crazy. It's like if you do ""shave and a haircut"" without the last part, you know?",3
LORELAI,"Come on, do it.",3
RORY,Will you stop giving me half-finished thoughts?,3
LORELAI,"I promise. Come on, do it.",3
RORY,Two bits.,3
LORELAI,Thank you.,3
RORY,Now what were you thinking?,3
LORELAI,Pizza and TV.,3
RORY,That's our fallback.,3
LORELAI,"That's why I said not, I remembered it was our fallback.",3
RORY,When did we become so old and pathetic?,3
LORELAI,"Hey, hey, we're neither. We're momentarily stuck on what to do tonight.",3
RORY,"It's a Friday night. We should be out, I don't know, partying with the homies.",3
Posted,05/11/03 14:30,3
LORELAI,Our Stars Hollow homies are all in bed by now.,3
RORY,Not Kirk. He'll be playing video trivia at the pizza place. We could go and watch.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, we're old and pathetic. How did it come to this?",3
RORY,"Well, it's our first Friday night that we haven't had to go to Grandma and Grandpa's for dinner.",3
LORELAI,I cannot for the life of me remember what we did before we started doing those.,3
RORY,It feels like a million years ago.,3
LORELAI,"Ooh, who are you calling?",3
RORY,It just feels weird for me not even to say hello to them on a Friday night.,3
LORELAI,"No, don't call them.",3
RORY,"Hey, this rift is between you and them. I'm still on friendly terms.",3
LORELAI,"I know, it's just that they're probably sitting there eating alone, shivering in an unheated room, the only illumination a single light bulb just so they can make us feel spectacularly guilty at the thought.",3
RORY,"Hey Grandpa, it's Rory. . . Rory.",3
LORELAI,He's pretending not to remember you?,3
RORY,"No, it's loud there.",3
LORELAI,Loud?,3
RORY,What's going on there?,3
RICHARD,"Oh, we're having a party.",3
RORY,A party?,3
LORELAI,A party?,3
RICHARD,"Sort of a last minute thing. Couldn't get too big a crowd here. I think we wound up with 55 or 60, something like that.",3
RORY,60 people.,3
RICHARD,"Oh, here come the mushroom caps everybody!",3
RORY,There's singing and mushroom caps.,3
LORELAI,I am appalled by this.,3
RORY,Sounds like a lot of fun.,3
RICHARD,"Oh, it is. Oh, now, your grandmother would come and say hello, but she's in the next room dancing with Lloyd Sandstone. Watch where you put those hands, Lloyd.",3
RORY,A guy named Lloyd is feeling up Grandma.,3
LORELAI,You're making this up.,3
RORY,"Well, um, I'll let you go, okay?",3
RICHARD,"Okay. Now, you're coming to visit after school on Monday, aren't ya?",3
RORY,"Yes, I'll see you then.",3
RICHARD,"Ah, can't wait. Bye now.",3
RORY,The Gilmore house is partying like it's 1999.,3
LORELAI,"And here it's ""At Home w ith The 700 Club.""",3
RORY,"Well, we didn't tell them to stop living their lives.",3
LORELAI,How could they bounce back so quickly?,3
RORY,"I don't know, but bounce they did.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, they win this time. But we've gotta think of something super big and fantastic and cool for next Friday night, okay?",3
RORY,Okay.,3
LORELAI,Now think.,3
RORY,Mushroom caps sound really good.,3
LORELAI,Sh.,3
RORY,,3
RORY,Hi.,3
LORELAI,Say cheese. I love my little digital camera. I wanna marry it.,3
RORY,Do you ever wanna put it away?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, you'll hurt little DigitalDan's feelings.",3
RORY,"Sorry, D.D.",3
LORELAI,"Gotcha! Oh, no, wait. Oh, missed. Got a good one of you, though. Nice cheekbones.",3
RORY,"So, could you focus on something non-photographic for a second?",3
LORELAI,"Aw, I'll try.",3
RORY,I was asked to pass this along to you.,3
LORELAI,Something from Ch ilton? You've been dipping girls' hair in the inkwells again?,3
RORY,Read it and see.,3
LORELAI,"""Dear Ms. Gilmore, with your daughter's final days of Chilton fast approaching, yours are, too."" Hm, not feeling the love here. Yadda, yadda, yadda. ""The Booster Club could use your help. We would greatly appreciate - "" Greatly's underlined three times. Trying to emphasize the word there. Got it, guys. Thanks. "" - your involvement, especially in light of your previous paucity of participation."" Ooh, they got me with alliteration and an obscure word.",3
RORY,The b*stards.,3
LORELAI,I've been summoned to duty.,3
RORY,Sounds like it.,3
LORELAI,"I feel like I should pack my rucksack, kiss my loved ones goodbye.",3
RORY,"So, don't do it, then.",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, you're as good as outta there. Yale's grabbed you. It's too late. We don't need anything from Ch ilton.",3
RORY,Except my graduation tickets.,3
LORELAI,We already got 'em.,3
RORY,"But we need extras. I just put in the request, and it's up to them now.",3
LORELAI,So we do need one kind of big thing.,3
RORY,And then there's my diploma.,3
LORELAI,You'll get your diploma at graduation.,3
RORY,"No, I get my diploma holder at graduation.",3
LORELAI,Do you think they would withhold your diploma based on my participation paucity?,3
RORY,I don't know.,3
LORELAI,"Oh man, I'm screwed. I guess I gotta do it.",3
LUKE,Hey guys.,3
LUKE,Was that necessary?,3
LORELAI,"Oh man, you do not photograph well.",3
LUKE,What?,3
LORELAI,"You've been getting some sleep, brother? 'Cause that's forty miles bad running.",3
LUKE,"I wasn't ready. Plus, it was a bad angle. Plus, this is a harsh light. A soft light would help with the thing with the eyes.",3
LORELAI,Look who knows what light he looks best in.,3
LUKE,You ready to order?,3
LORELAI,I'm gonna take a picture of the menu and then order off the camera.,3
LUKE,Yell when she's tired of the thing.,3
RORY,Give it time.,3
LORELAI,Now I'm gonna zoom in on just the breakfast meats.,3
RORY,,3
ZACH,"Whoa, cool.",3
DAVE,We all finished at the same time.,3
LANE,That has never happened.,3
BRIAN,The middle of that song didn't even sound like us.,3
DAVE,"Yeah, it sounded good.",3
RORY,"It sounded great, guys. All of it. Didn't it?",3
JESS,Not too shabby.,3
DAVE,We are so ready for this gig.,3
LANE,We've got a gig. I just love the sound of that.,3
JESS,Where is it?,3
LANE,Kyle from school. His parents are going to Marriage Encounter for the weekend so he's throwing this mondo party.,3
JESS,You got enough songs?,3
DAVE,We have enough for two half-hour sets. What we need is a name.,3
BRIAN,I made my suggestion.,3
ZACH,"Yeah, and we vetoed ""The Harry Potters."" Next.",3
BRIAN,So yours is better?,3
ZACH,"""Follow Them to the Edge of the Dessert"" is memorable and classy.",3
BRIAN,I run out of breath every time I say it.,3
ZACH,"You've got asthma, dude. You run out of breath saying your name.",3
DAVE,"Yeah, Brian, we can't work our name around your respiratory illnesses.",3
BRIAN,"Even without an inhaler, ""Follow Them to the Edge of the Dessert"" is too long.",3
ZACH,"Yeah, but when we get famous, our fans will shorten it to FTTTEOTD.",3
DAVE,Do you guys have any suggestions?,3
RORY,"Oh, we wouldn't dare.",3
BRIAN,"Hey Lane, how are you gonna play a party like this with your mom being so strict?",3
LANE,"Easy. Rory and Jess are gonna deliver my drums to Kyle's house for me, then my friend Young Chui is going to pick me up to take me to a fictional Seventh Day Adventist bowling party that will conveniently last the length of our gig.",3
ZACH,Nice going.,3
BRIAN,I've got my own ball and shoes.,3
ZACH,"Dude, don't tell people that.",3
RORY,See you guys.,3
JESS,"Yeah, see ya.",3
BAND,Bye.,3
BRIAN,"How about ""The We""?",3
ZACH,We?,3
BRIAN,"Yeah. We are ""The We.""",3
ZACH,I can't talk about this anymore.,3
RORY,"So, any word on your car?",3
JESS,Nothing.,3
RORY,You'd think someone would've found it. It was pretty one of a kind.,3
JESS,"It's probably holed up in some chop shop. Say goodbye, it's gone. Whatever. Let's talk about something else.",3
RORY,I like that you're getting to know Dave a little.,3
JESS,"Yeah, he's a cool guy.",3
RORY,Good. It's going to make the four of us going to prom together even more fun.,3
JESS,"Ah, yes, I almost forgot about the prom.",3
RORY,"No, you were trying to forget about the prom.",3
JESS,I agreed to go and I am a man of my word.,3
RORY,How's that arm I twisted?,3
JESS,I got the feeling back in it.,3
RORY,"It's just if there was one more dance I wanna go to in my whole life, it'd be the Stars Hollow High prom, with Lane. That's a big part of it.",3
JESS,I'm getting the tickets this week.,3
RORY,"And I'll pay, okay?",3
JESS,Not a chance.,3
RORY,"It means a tux, you know. I know it's geeky.",3
JESS,Tuxes are also James Bond. That's not geeky.,3
RORY,You're kind.,3
JESS,,3
LORELAI,Sookie.,3
SOOKIE,Yeah?,3
LORELAI,I need love and a hug. I just had to lay off Julio.,3
SOOKIE,"Oh, poor thing.",3
LORELAI,That's the third one today. All I'm doing is crushing people's spirits.,3
SOOKIE,But you told them that we all love them and will hire them back as soon as all the repairs are done.,3
LORELAI,"And I gave them their severance checks and they were all very gracious, which made itthat much harder.",3
SOOKIE,We're gonna get 'em back. It'll all be good again.,3
LORELAI,"I had to lay off Frank, too, but I just couldn't do another one, so Michel offered to do it.",3
SOOKIE,Did he say he'd be nice?,3
LORELAI,"Yes, and then he skipped off to do it.",3
SOOKIE,"Oh, boy.",3
LORELAI,"So, what's going on with Luke here?",3
SOOKIE,I don't know. I've been keeping my distance because of what happened.,3
LORELAI,What happened?,3
SOOKIE,"Well, he was lying on the floor pretty much like that, tinkering with stuff back there, and I got down and leaned in to see what he was doing, and after a while, I realized that the whole time, my hand was on his butt.",3
LORELAI,Sookie!,3
SOOKIE,It was an accident.,3
LORELAI,It's getting very Cinemax at night in here.,3
SOOKIE,It was embarrassing.,3
LORELAI,"Uh huh. So, how was it?",3
SOOKIE,His butt?,3
LORELAI,Yeah.,3
SOOKIE,It's got a nice shape to it.,3
LUKE,Will you two stop talking about my butt?,3
LORELAI,It's all positive.,3
LUKE,And in bad taste.,3
LORELAI,We'll just talk about it after you leave.,3
LUKE,"Which is now, because I'm done.",3
LORELAI,So what's the prognosis?,3
LUKE,"It's the same as what the stove company told you. The wall back here is burned from the fire. You're gonna have to rebuild the whole thing before you can even think of reconnecting the gas. It's gonna take awhile, sorry.",3
LORELAI,"No, Luke, thanks for doing this. It's exactly what the contractor said. We just wanted a guy with a good butt's opinion.",3
SOOKIE,"Yeah, Tom has a terrible butt.",3
LUKE,Please stop that.,3
LORELAI,So Rory and I will see you Saturday for breakfast?,3
LUKE,"Actually, you won't. Nicole and I are going skiing and we're getting a ridiculously early start.",3
LORELAI,That sounds fun. Why ridiculously early?,3
LUKE,Because she has to drive in from her place in New York first because she can't stay at my place because of Jess.,3
LORELAI,"Hey, if you want, why don't you have her come in Friday night, you guys can stay here at the inn. It'll be on the house.",3
LUKE,"Nah, that's okay.",3
LORELAI,"No, do it, Luke. I mean, I know we have rooms available, and it's my way of saying thanks for parading that nice butt around here.",3
LUKE,Geez.,3
LORELAI,"No kidding, really, it's a great butt.",3
LUKE,Stop it.,3
LORELAI,"No, really, it's no problem.",3
LUKE,"Well, I don't know, maybe. Either way, thank for the offer.",3
LORELAI,All right. I'll tell Michel to keep a room available in case you decide to do it.,3
LUKE,Okay. See ya.,3
LORELAI,"Thanks, bye.",3
MICHELorelai,Did you know that Frank rescues Chow puppies?,3
LORELAI,"Uh, no.",3
MICHELorelai,He feeds and houses them on his own dime 'til he finds an owner. We can't fire him. And they are so cute. Chin-Chin and Pau-Pau. Pau-Pau's the one with the squatty little nose. I took them both.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, okay, good job.",3
MICHELorelai,I have to go buy dog food. Will you fire Frank for me?,3
LORELAI,,3
TERRY,"With that last function, we raised just enough to put us in the black, which got the school controller off our back, which is going to make our last endeavor that much easier.",3
CARRIE,Haven't we already talked all this stuff to death?,3
TERRY,"Yes, but we need to fill in our last minute Booster Club add-ons here.",3
LORELAI,You get the scary threatening letter?,3
DOUG,Yup.,3
TERRY,"So, onto Grad Night, our last event of the year.",3
JOAN,"God, this year's gone by fast.",3
CARRIE,I can't believe my Farrah's eighteen.,3
DOUG,My kid was eighteen was she was ten.,3
CARRIE,Men.,3
DOUG,What?,3
LORELAI,"Lay low, Doug. They're setting traps. So, um, what are we doing this year?",3
TERRY,We're throwing a big party on a yacht.,3
LORELAI,Fun.,3
TERRY,"The party starts while it's in dock, then it sails for three hours and concludes with a fireworks show.",3
CARRIE,How's the fundraising going?,3
TERRY,"Terrific. The last fashion show alone brought in half of what we need, and the bake sale today brought in way more than I expected. Oh, that reminds me.",3
LORELAI,What's this?,3
TERRY,Our cash box. You are the Grad Night treasurer.,3
LORELAI,I'm the what?,3
TERRY,"Before you got here, we took a little vote and you won.",3
LORELAI,"Well, uh, maybe there should be a recount 'cause I stink with money.",3
TERRY,The vote was unanimous.,3
LORELAI,"I was late, can we revote?",3
CARRIE,"Doug was late, too, and he was voted lead chaperone.",3
DOUG,Goody.,3
LORELAI,"Come on, we can take 'em.",3
CARRIE,"It's really not a tough job, Lorelai. You just manage the cash, keep the simple books, it's easy.",3
TERRY,"Although, it does mean if you don't show up at our next meeting, we're going to assume you ran off with our money.",3
LORELAI,"No, no, I wouldn't do that.",3
MAX,"Hello, ladies. Hope I'm not too late. Oh, and gentleman, sorry.",3
CARRIE,"Oh, Doug's one of the ladies now.",3
MAX,"Well, good to see you all. Terry, Carrie. Lorelai, good to see you.",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, good, same here.",3
MAX,"So, what'd I miss?",3
TERRY,Nothing much. Lorelai's been made our Grad Night treasurer.,3
MAX,You up to the challenge?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah. I'll watch the little box here.",3
MAX,"And let me guess, other than that, they've been picking on you mercilessly.",3
DOUG,Pretty much.,3
MAX,"Well, I'm here to lend you gender support, my friend. So, Terry, why don't you continue?",3
TERRY,Great. We were discussing Grad Night.,3
MAX,The yacht. Sounds great.,3
TERRY,,3
SOOKIE,Weird. Very weird.,3
LORELAI,It's as if we had no history. He treated me the same as he treated what's her name and the overly coifed lady and the one who kept jiggling her leg the whole time.,3
SOOKIE,"Ugh, I hate that.",3
LORELAI,It's like an earthquake. And he was so nonchalant.,3
SOOKIE,"So, standoff-y?",3
LORELAI,"No, he was just Max. And I wanted to hook up with after to talk, but very conveniently, he excused himself five minutes early for an appointment and I couldn't walk out early with him because I'm the stupid treasurer and it would look fishy.",3
SOOKIE,They made you treasurer. Are they insane?,3
LORELAI,I tried to tell them. And what's with this appointment nonsense? And no eye contact.,3
SOOKIE,You mean he never once looked at you?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, he looked, but it was very lacking in meaning.",3
SOOKIE,Were you looking at him mean ingfully?,3
LORELAI,No. I was trying to play it cool.,3
SOOKIE,"Well, there you go. He was doing the same thing. You were both James Dean-ing it, trying to keep it professional.",3
LORELAI,"No, he was not playing at it, I was. He was really it.",3
SOOKIE,What?,3
LORELAI,Cool.,3
SOOKIE,Got it.,3
LORELAI,So. . .,3
SOOKIE,Maybe you two never kissed.,3
LORELAI,"Me and Max? Oh no, we kissed.",3
SOOKIE,Maybe it was an illusion.,3
LORELAI,"It was not an illusion, Doug Henning. We kissed.",3
SOOKIE,"Don't be so sure because something like this happened to me when I was like ten. I was so into Leif Garrett and I fantasized about kissing him so much that at some point, I really thought it happened.",3
LORELAI,"I kissed Max, Sookie.",3
SOOKIE,I can still feel Leif's lips on mine.,3
LORELAI,I kissed him.,3
SOOKIE,"Well, what is Rory's take on all this?",3
LORELAI,"Oh, I told her about the kiss at first, but it's weird. I mean, he's back at Chilton and I'm back having some sort of involvement with her teacher. She's dealing with finals and everything. I don't wanna stress her out about this.",3
SOOKIE,"Lorelai, what's the ultimate thing here? Do you wanna get back together with him?",3
LORELAI,"I don't know. I don't know what I'm feeling or what I'm looking for these days, and I hate that. 'Cause it's so wishy-washy, but it's true. I mean, technically, I'm still seeing Alex, although it's more intermittent than ever. I'm not even sure I wanna get back together with Max. The kiss just happened out of the blue.",3
SOOKIE,The alleged kiss.,3
LORELAI,"Sookie, we kissed.",3
SOOKIE,"Okay, calm down.",3
LORELAI,"If I knew where Max was on all this, I would know better where I was. It's like when you go to a steak and lobster place, it's easier to know what you want once you know what your date wants. Like, you want steak if he's getting lobster, 'cause then you can share. Or if he's not, you can get surf and turf, though you risk looking like a pig, but some guys aren't turned on by a big appetite, and now I'm not just confused, I'm massively hungry.",3
SOOKIE,"Me, too. Maybe lunch will take your mind off it a bit.",3
LORELAI,Hope so.,3
SOOKIE,Are you sure there was really an Alex?,3
LORELAI,,3
PRINCIPALorelai,Come in .,3
PRINCIPALorelai,"Well, well. Jess Mariano. What a pleasure. Sit down.",3
JESS,I was just trying to buy prom tickets and they told me to go see you.,3
PRINCIPALorelai,"Sit down. So, the prom, huh? I wouldn't have taken you for someone who'd wanna go to the prom.",3
JESS,My girlfriend wants to.,3
PRINCIPALorelai,"Oh, that's too bad.",3
JESS,"What, why?",3
PRINCIPALorelai,Because you flunked out.,3
JESS,I what?,3
PRINCIPALorelai,"You're not graduating, Jess. Prom tickets are for graduating seniors only. Guess your girlfriend's outta luck.",3
JESS,"Now wait a minute. I'm just a little behind. I can catch up, no sweat.",3
PRINCIPALorelai,"You can't, you missed too much.",3
JESS,It hasn't been that much.,3
PRINCIPALorelai,Thirty-one days you've been out. Cutoff's twenty.,3
JESS,"So that's it, just like that?",3
PRINCIPALorelai,That's it.,3
JESS,Thanks for the warning.,3
PRINCIPALorelai,"You mean the nine warning slips we gave you weren't enough? All the meetings that I tried to set up between you and your guidance counselor, between you and me that you blew off, that wasn't warning enough?",3
JESS,"I can catch up, I'm smarter than anyone here.",3
PRINCIPALorelai,"And humble, too.",3
JESS,"I can catch up, you'll see.",3
PRINCIPALorelai,"There's nothing to see, you're out.",3
JESS,"Fine, I'll take summer school if that's what you want.",3
PRINCIPALorelai,"Good, but it's not enough. You have to take the whole year over.",3
JESS,The whole year? No way.,3
PRINCIPALorelai,Then no diploma.,3
JESS,"At least let me go to the prom, what's the big deal?",3
PRINCIPALorelai,We're done here.,3
JESS,Come on.,3
PRINCIPALorelai,"You wanna talk about coming back next year, my door's open.",3
JESS,I'm not gonna miss this place.,3
PRINCIPALorelai,,3
LORELAI,"No, no, it's impossible.",3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,I just counted the money in the cash box and I'm eighteen dollars short.,3
RORY,Weren't you supposed to deposit all that at the bank?,3
LORELAI,"Uh, be judgmental later. Help me in my fiscal crisis here.",3
RORY,Did you count the money when they gave it to you?,3
LORELAI,"Ah, I glanced at it.",3
RORY,"Boy, you are a sucky treasurer.",3
LORELAI,The job was forced on me.,3
RORY,"Well, the cash box must've been short when you got it.",3
LORELAI,Or maybe a burglar broke in here. That could've happened.,3
RORY,"A burglar who bypassed out TV, our stereo, and our jewelry and went straight for the Booster Club cash box and took eighteen dollars and left the rest?",3
LORELAI,Some burglars are less greedy than others.,3
RORY,"Well, I'm out of answers.",3
LORELAI,Great. I'm gonna have to put eighteen of my own dollars in to ward off suspicion. You're off to the party this early?,3
RORY,Jess and I are helping the band set up. I do the cymbals.,3
LORELAI,You're not taking your purse.,3
RORY,I'm not?,3
LORELAI,"You don't need money, you don't need ID.",3
RORY,"Well, where will I keep my house key?",3
LORELAI,"You'll put your house key through the metal thingy on your belt. You'll only lose it if you take off your belt, and if you're taking off your belt for any reason at the party, I'm not sure I want you coming home.",3
RORY,Brilliant.,3
LORELAI,"Uh, your shoes okay? You got good traction?",3
RORY,Traction?,3
LORELAI,"Well, there'll be liquids of various textures and disgustingness. You eating there?",3
RORY,"Oh, if they have stuff.",3
LORELAI,Do not eat chips out of a communal bowl. You might as well stick your hand in a toilet.,3
RORY,Nice.,3
LORELAI,"If you're desperate, offer to be the person who replenishes them with new bags and grab a handful out of the new bag and dump the rest in the communal bowl.",3
RORY,Got it.,3
LORELAI,"And keep in mind that getting up on a table and performing a song of any kind will haunt you for the rest of your life. Trust me. Been there, done that.",3
RORY,I wasn't planning on doing that.,3
LORELAI,"Hm, those things are never planned. You going now?",3
RORY,Yup.,3
LORELAI,"I'm going, too. I'll lock it up.",3
RORY,Otherwise I'd have to undo my belt. Enjoy your Booster Club meeting.,3
LORELAI,"I will. Hey, hon?",3
RORY,Yeah?,3
LORELAI,"I promised myself I wasn't gonna ask you about Max anymore considering the history and that he's back teaching you and all. . .and I'm gonna keep my promise. Good, huh?",3
RORY,Very good.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, well, that's all I wanted to say.",3
RORY,,3
DAVE,Does this set up feel right to everybody?,3
LANE,Cool by me.,3
BRIAN,"Me, too.",3
DAVE,How's it look out there?,3
RORY,"Like you're gonna b*llet straight to the top of the charts, with a b*llet or a - a g*n's gonna sh**t a b*llet, and I'm not, uh, familiar with the precise terminology, but it's working, right?",3
JESS,They look like a band to me.,3
ZACH,You need to move back more.,3
BRIAN,Why?,3
ZACH,"Because when I do my double jump kick off the amp with slashing windmills, I'm gonna need more room.",3
LANE,"Well, don't do that then.",3
DAVE,"Yeah, sounds a little too Milli Vanilli, Zach.",3
BRIAN,"And if I back up anymore, my extension cord might damage the miniature date palm.",3
LANE,The what?,3
BRIAN,It's what that's called. My aunt's got one.,3
ZACH,"Dude, don't call plants by their specific names, it's very not rock and roll.",3
DAVE,"Let's finalize the set list, guys.",3
RORY,"Need any help hiding the valuables, Kyle?",3
KYLE,"Nope. We stashed the snow globes, hid the Lladros, now we're just packing up the Hummels.",3
MARSHALLorelai,Two to go.,3
KYLE,"Marshall, watch it! Boy with Toothache is mom's favorite.",3
MARSHALLorelai,Sorry.,3
KYLE,"Hey, did I hear the singer say something about a double jump kick?",3
RORY,We'll talk him out of it.,3
KYLE,Good.,3
MARSHALLorelai,"Zealous Xylophonist, that's sweet.",3
DAVE,"Starting off with a slow tune won't work, Brian.",3
ZACH,"Yeah, man, it's so emo, it makes me sick.",3
BRIAN,I was just playing devil's advocate.,3
DAVE,Devil's advocate.,3
ZACH,Not a bad name.,3
BOYS,Keg!,3
KYLE,That's my cousin Rick. He just turned twenty-one. Pretty awesome.,3
RICK,"Twenty-one, yeah!",3
LANE,"What is that, beer?",3
ZACH,"No, it's one of those milk kegs.",3
BRIAN,Good one.,3
LANE,"There's beer, is that legal?",3
DAVE,"Well, apparently Rick is twenty-one.",3
RICK,"Twenty-one, woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!",3
DAVE,Or just really into that particular integer.,3
LANE,Beer.,3
ZACH,"It's a party, Lane. What were you expecting, Tang?",3
LANE,"No, I guess not.",3
KYLE,"The carpet, guys. Lift it, lift it.",3
RICK,"Oh, we got it.",3
KYLE,"Marshall, go get towels to set it on. And not the good towels, the swim towels. YOUNG",3
CHUI,"Anything I can help you with, guys?",3
DAVE,"Uh, we got it covered. Thanks, Young Chui. YOUNG",3
CHUI,"How about you, Lane? You need water or anything?",3
DAVE,"Uh, Young Chui, you should probably stay away from the band area. We got a lot of cords and stuff, and I don't want you to get electrocuted and die. YOUNG",3
CHUI,"Oh, okay.",3
DAVE,"So, is he staying for the whole thing?",3
LANE,He's got nowhere else to go.,3
KYLE,These are the good towels.,3
MARSHALLorelai,These are the swim towels.,3
KYLE,"The swim towels have stripes and they're oversized. Now, come on, hurry. We still have to put away my dad's military icon collector plates.",3
JESS,"We're here a little early, don't you think?",3
RORY,"No, we're with the band. We're the roadies and the sound crew and I'm advising on makeup for Lane and I'm the keeper of Brian's sandwich and thermos. So we're busy backstage-type people.",3
JESS,We're dork-early.,3
RORY,"Come on, get into the spirit of things. Hello Cleveland!",3
JESS,Guess I'll wander around a little.,3
DAVE,And you couldn't even work your slashing windmills in.,3
ZACH,"Yeah, maybe I'll skip it.",3
DAVE,,3
LORELAI,"Uh, Michel, are you okay?",3
MICHELorelai,Do I look okay?,3
LORELAI,Are those people waiting for a bellman?,3
MICHELorelai,"No, they're waiting for a unicorn to sing to a rainbow. Yes, a bellman. But there's only one because we had to lay off the others. And a maid called in sick, so not only am I dealing with answering phones and checking people in and out, but I'm going to have to do turn down service and carry people's bags to their rooms and. . .",3
LORELAI,You're going to a bad place. Now just take a breath and go to a good place.,3
MICHELorelai,"Plus, I had to run home an d play with my Chow puppies because the Chow book said they need love and stimulation or else they'll m*rder you later on. And Pau-Pau had fallen in her water bowl and was soaking wet so I had to blow dry her and. . .",3
LORELAI,"Okay, the nice place, and I can stay and help a little bit, okay?",3
MICHELorelai,She could've drowned. I'm a bad daddy.,3
LORELAI,"Pau-Pau's fine. Just watch the desk, get the bellman back here. I'll do turn down.",3
MICHELorelai,,3
RORY,"They're getting ready to go on. They're all hyperventilating to the same rhythm, so that's a positive sign. What are you looking at?",3
JESS,The happy family. Kinda depressing if you ask me.,3
RORY,"Oh, Mr. Sunshine. You're spreading so much joy around, you're embarrassing yourself. You've got to get a little more moody.",3
JESS,I'll try.,3
RORY,Let's look around a little bit.,3
JESS,Okay. Seems a little early for that.,3
RORY,It never is.,3
JESS,Bathroom line.,3
RORY,Figures.,3
JESS,Hey. What's up with you guys?,3
KYLE,Stupid keg.,3
MARSHALLorelai,It's not working.,3
JESS,Where's the tap?,3
KYLE,The what?,3
JESS,"It's a keg, it's sealed. You need to hook up a tap to pump the beer out.",3
KYLE,I told you the thing in the bag did something.,3
RICK,No instructions.,3
JESS,"Jeez. There, start pumping.",3
MARSHALLorelai,All right. To Jess!,3
KYLE,To Jess.,3
RICK,To Jess.,3
JESS,Yeah.,3
KYLE,Yeah.,3
RORY,"You and Springsteen, the working man's hero.",3
RORY,"You ready to go on, guys?",3
DAVE,Only if Brian rallies.,3
RORY,"What's wrong, Brian?",3
BRIAN,I don't feel good.,3
DAVE,It's his heartburn again.,3
ZACH,"I told you, dude, it's your citrus intake. Stop eating oranges.",3
LANE,"Rory. Uh, you've gotta do me a b ig favor.",3
RORY,Name it .,3
LANE,Young Chui's driving me crazy.,3
RORY,What do you want me to do?,3
LANE,"Uh, if you see any unattached girls who you think would go for a very available, uh, needy, self-delusional guy, send 'em Young Chui's way.",3
RORY,I'll keep a lookout.,3
DAVE,Lane.,3
LANE,"Oh my God, this is it.",3
RORY,Knock 'em dead.,3
DAVE,"Brian, you with us?",3
BRIAN,I have completely forgotten how to play the bass.,3
ZACH,Perfect.,3
DAVE,"Brian, you're just nervous. Take a deep breath and use your inhaler.",3
ZACH,"Yeah, and don't forget that the hair and fingernails on John Entwistle's body were still growing when they brought in his replacement.",3
BRIAN,You're gonna replace me?,3
DAVE,We're not gonna replace you. Just relax and let the music flow through you.,3
RICK,"Come on, let's go!",3
GIRLorelai,"Yeah, come on - rock and roll!",3
LANE,"Zach, start.",3
DAVE,"Wait, wait, someone's gotta introduce us. Rory, introduce us.",3
RORY,Me? Why me?,3
RICK,"Come on, let's go!",3
MARSHALLorelai,"Yeah, crank it!",3
DAVE,"Go, go.",3
RORY,"All right. Uh, now, who wants to hear some tunes? Okay, good, there's a consensus. Here they are, Stars Hollow's rockingest band. Although they're not all from Stars Hollow, but they, um, they practice there, so we kind of consider them our own. Here they are. . . What's your name?",3
ZACH,"""Follow them to the Edge of the Dessert.""",3
DAVE,"""The Chops."" ""Follow them to the Edge of the Dessert.""",3
ZACH,,3
LUKE,Yeah?,3
LORELAI,Turn down.,3
LUKE,Come on in.,3
LORELAI,Hello there. This won't take long. Luke.,3
LUKE,Lorelai.,3
LORELAI,What are you doing here?,3
LUKE,"You invited us, rememb er?",3
LORELAI,Us?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, hey. Hi Nicole. There's the ""us"".",3
NICOLE,"Hi, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,"I don't usually do this turn down service. I mean, I did when I started many moons ago, but that's when I was a maid. Wow, you guys are here.",3
LUKE,You didn't know?,3
LORELAI,"No. I mean, I rememb er inviting you. It's great that you're here. Um, but when I told Michel I would do the turn down service, it must've slipped his mind that you were here. Pau-Pau fell in her water dish.",3
LUKE,What?,3
LORELAI,Never mind. I'll just do this and get out of your way.,3
LUKE,"Hey, you don't have to.",3
NICOLE,"Yeah, Lorelai, really, we can do all this.",3
LORELAI,"No, you are our guests and you deserve to get what you're paying for.",3
LUKE,We're not paying.,3
LORELAI,"No, no, but this is where you start paying - in sweat.",3
LUKE,What?,3
NICOLE,"Fame, right?",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, Debbie Allen. In sweat. I just loved how she said that. Let's see. . .uh, you need towels.",3
LUKE,You can just give 'em to me.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, here are your towels. And, let me see. . . oh, I'll draw your curtains closed. What else, what else? It's been a little while since I've done this. Oh, do you want a fire?",3
LUKE,I don't know. Nicole?,3
NICOLE,"Uh, a fire would be nice.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, I'll light it for you. We have these new log bags now, makes it real easy. Uh, okay. So, nothing like a fire on a cold night like this, huh?",3
LUKE,Mm.,3
LORELAI,"Hm, I'm not having much luck here. And, uh, you know what, we laid off the person who was able to light these things no problem, now we can't light these things, and ironically we laid him off because of a fire.",3
LUKE,"It's okay, forget it. I can light it.",3
LORELAI,"Okay. What else, let's see. Oh, um, well, turn down. I need to turn down the bed.",3
LUKE,"Really, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,"No, no, no. Up, up, up. Okay, I'll get ya all settled here, nice and comfy. Great lines with these covers here. Pillows, nice and plump. And a couple of pillow mints. There you go, now you're all ready to. . .uh, you're all ready for your evening.",3
LUKE,"Fine, good, that's good.",3
NICOLE,"Yes, great, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,,3
DAVE,"Okay, thanks. Uh, we're gonna take a short break and then we'll be back.",3
RORY,"Guys, that was amazing. Really, it was awesome.",3
DAVE,Thanks.,3
ZACH,"Dude, you did good, you really did. But you got a little too close to me when you were singing into the mike.",3
BRIAN,I got as close as I had to.,3
ZACH,"Your nose touched my cheek, man. That's too close.",3
LANE,"Guys, come on, just be happy. We played and we didn't suck, right?",3
DAVE,"Yeah, it was good.",3
KYLE,"Come on, let's spread the word. All drinks on coasters, please.",3
MARSHALLorelai,"Hey, the coasters are there to be used.",3
LANE,"Dave, what's wrong? I mean, we totally rocked.",3
DAVE,We sounded great.,3
LANE,Then what is it?,3
DAVE,It's this Young Chui thing. It's driving me crazy.,3
LANE,Why?,3
DAVE,"Why? Lane, when are you. . .when are you gonna break up with him?",3
LANE,It's complicated. Young Chui's very sensitive right now.,3
DAVE,"I'm sorry, but I don't care.",3
LANE,"If you got to know him, you'd understand.",3
DAVE,I don't want to get to know him. I just want him to do his part and break up with you so that I can take you to your prom. He's acting like he's in love with you or something.,3
LANE,Well. . .,3
DAVE,"Oh, no. Is he?",3
LANE,Kind of.,3
DAVE,Kind of?,3
LANE,"Apparently, totally.",3
DAVE,"Young Chui is in love with you and that's why he won't break up with you, so that he gets to take you to your prom. And he knows that your mom likes him and that we're running out of time.",3
LANE,"No, we're not out of time.",3
DAVE,The prom's in two weeks.,3
LANE,"I'll make it happen, I swear.",3
DAVE,It's too late. I'll see you for the next set.,3
LANE,Dave.,3
JESS,"So, what now?",3
RORY,"What do you mean, what now?",3
JESS,"Let's go, let's get out of here.",3
RORY,Go where?,3
JESS,Anywhere.,3
RORY,It's early.,3
JESS,It's boring.,3
RORY,"Jess, we can't just go.",3
JESS,"Yes, we can.",3
RORY,The band's playing a whole other set.,3
JESS,They can do it without us.,3
RORY,"I don't wanna leave. Now, come on, try to have fun. Talk, mingle.",3
JESS,I don't wanna talk to anybody else. I don't like anybody else.,3
RORY,"I don't wanna leave. I need to stay here for Lane, come on. Gloomy.",3
JESS,"We'll go right when they get done playing, okay?",3
RORY,"Sure, Grandpa.",3
JESS,Rory.,3
RORY,"We'll go then, I promise.",3
KYLE,,3
RORY,Hi guys.,3
DEAN,Hey.,3
LINDSAY,Hey.,3
RORY,"So, Lindsay, what did you think of Lane's band?",3
LINDSAY,I liked 'em. Although I didn't recognize most of the songs.,3
DEAN,She's not a music freak like you.,3
RORY,"Well, we all can't be freaks.",3
DEAN,True.,3
RORY,So what kind of music do you like?,3
LINDSAY,"I don't know. . .uh, Michelle Branch, Matchbox 20.",3
JESS,Jeez.,3
RORY,"I like them, too. I mean, I like all kinds of things.",3
LINDSAY,You used to go to our school.,3
RORY,He still goes.,3
DEAN,Really? I haven't seen you around much.,3
JESS,"What are you, the attendance monitor? I'm gonna go see what the hell's holding up this line.",3
RORY,He's not feeling well.,3
LINDSAY,That's too bad.,3
DEAN,"Uh, well, we'll see you later.",3
LINDSAY,Bye.,3
RORY,Bye.,3
MARSHALLorelai,"Hey, Lane. There's some guy looking for you.",3
LANE,"Good, where?",3
KYLE,"Oh, oh, and the part where Gimli the Dwarf is riding his horse, then Legolas grabs the front straps and swings himself up on top of it.",3
RICK,"Dude, dude, that was awesome!",3
LANE,Any more left in that thing?,3
KYLE,Plenty. Foam or no foam?,3
LANE,"Anything you hand me, Kyle, I'm downing.",3
LANE,Very refreshing.,3
KYLE,,3
LORELAI,"Hi, sorry I'm late. Actually, I'm not late. I was right on time, but then I remembered I leftthe cash box in the car. I mean, I was not used to having to carry a cash box. So I went back and got it, and I was carrying it by the handle and the stupid thing flew open and money flew everywhere, and I may have lost eighteen bucks in the process. Anyway, here I am. So where's Doug?",3
TERRY,I believe we scared Doug away.,3
CARRIE,I love scaring the Dougs away.,3
JOAN,"So, you were telling us about these ridiculous dock fees.",3
TERRY,"Right. We got what was supposed to be a final quote from the yacht owner, who then rememb ers he failed to mention an exorbitant dock fee.",3
JOAN,Unbelievable.,3
TERRY,"And I don't wanna pay. I made some calls and I have several suggestions on how to get around it. Oh, but first, let me bring in a student from the senior class who wanted to give her own thoughts about the yacht trip. Come on in.",3
CARRIE,Oh no.,3
JOAN,Paris Gellar.,3
PARIS,"Ladies, thank you for seeing me. I know you're busy with work and have families to get home to, so I really appreciate your courtesy, and I'll make it brief. Having Grad Night on a yacht is the worst idea since Neville Chamberlain told the people of England, ""Hey, don't worry about Hitler. He's a stand-up chap."" Forget the inconvenience of being at sea with guests unable to leave if the party is dull or if the band, which will inevitably be composed of accountants with semi-mullets, decides to do a half-hour tribute to Kenny G. The seasickness factor alone, abetted by snuck-in flasks and badly cooked food, could lead to an epidemic, which may lead to lawsuits the school could ill afford. These points conclusively call for a change in venue to a hotel ballroom, a restaurant facility, several of which I've already called. Here are the results of my research. I've also included a list of maritime disasters from the past fifty years -- capsizings, onboard fires, et cetera -- and trust me, it'll put you off your lunch. Thank you for your time and cooperation.",3
TERRY,"So, my thought is to discuss these yacht fees directly with the yacht owner first.",3
JOAN,Absolutely.,3
BARBARA,"Hello everyone, sorry I'm late.",3
TERRY,"Oh, that's okay.",3
BARBARA,"I'm Bar bara Epstein, I teach drama, and I'll be your faculty rep tonight.",3
TERRY,Welcome Bar bara.,3
BARBARA,"I just left Max Medina, he filled me in on everything that you're doing here.",3
TERRY,"Good, then we'll get a running start. We're dealing with a fee that we do not wanna pay for this yacht.",3
LORELAI,"Keep going, girls. I just need. . .um, I'll be right back.",3
TERRY,Okay.,3
LORELAI,"Joan, you gotta watch the cash box.",3
JOAN,Will do.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, sorry. Um, nearest bathroom? That way, huh? I'm gonna go this way. I think the farthest one is the one I'm looking for. I told a friend I'd meet her there, so I'll just go. . .",3
LORELAI,Gotcha.,3
MAX,You sure did.,3
LORELAI,Bad time?,3
MAX,Kind of.,3
LORELAI,Busy?,3
MAX,Real busy.,3
LORELAI,You're avoiding me.,3
MAX,"No, I'm not.",3
LORELAI,Then what's with the 'I'm busy' thing?,3
MAX,I can't be busy?,3
LORELAI,"Ah, but that's avoiding me, saying you're busy.",3
MAX,"No, it's descriptive of my current state. These essays are due back tomorrow, I'm way behind on my reading, so I'm eat ing my day-old vending machine at my desk in my futile attempt to try and catch up.",3
LORELAI,Two rotations.,3
MAX,What?,3
LORELAI,"It's in the Booster Club bylaws, my friend. I looked it up myself. Faculty advisors are supposed to do a minimum of two consecutive rotations with the Booster Club and you did only one.",3
MAX,I did three.,3
LORELAI,What?,3
MAX,I did three. You went to my third one. I did the previous two you weren't at.,3
LORELAI,I'm assuming you have documentation?,3
MAX,Lorelai.,3
LORELAI,"With Lorelai Gilmore, it's trust but verify.",3
MAX,"Well, I'm sure I can scrounge up a witness.",3
LORELAI,Why did you treat me so weird at that last meeting?,3
MAX,I treated you with respect and kindness.,3
LORELAI,"That's why it was weird. It's how you treated Terry and Joan, too. I mean, did you also kiss Terry and Joan?",3
MAX,"Yeah, I did. And Doug. He was the best of the three.",3
LORELAI,Max.,3
MAX,"I was playing it cool. You were, too. I was just following suit.",3
LORELAI,"No, I was playing it cool because you were playing it cool. And I'm the treasurer and the treasurer has to be cool or it just looks suspicious.",3
MAX,"Wait, wait, wait. Ten feet.",3
LORELAI,Ten feet?,3
MAX,"That's a safe distance for us, and the more furniture in between, the better.",3
LORELAI,I'm not gonna attack you.,3
MAX,"I'm not worried about you, I'm worried about me. I mean, there are people still walking the halls and this is my workplace and I can't be held responsible for what I do around you. I mean, you are like a - like a - like a mythological creature that casts some kind of spell on me and makes me act stupid. I'm not stupid. I don't act stupid with anyone else. Uh, we're too close again.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, I didn't bring a frickin' tape measure. I'm not good at judging distances. You'll have to help me out with the ten feet thing.",3
MAX,"Well, it's a little bigger than a basketball player. Just keep a really big basketball player between us.",3
LORELAI,"Wow, I bet there's a sentence that's never been uttered before.",3
MAX,"There are other complications with this whole thing, you know. Just thought I'd tell you.",3
LORELAI,What other complications?,3
MAX,"I was seeing someone in California. There, I said it.",3
LORELAI,"You mean, you weren't living like a Trappist monk while you were in California? I'm shocked.",3
MAX,That doesn't bother you?,3
LORELAI,"Max, we weren't together. I mean, I have been seeing someone, too.",3
MAX,"Well, I would probably still be seeing Diane if I hadn't moved back here. That's something to think about.",3
LORELAI,"So you can't date anyone for the rest of your life because if you'd stayed in California, which you didn't, you might still be dating Diane?",3
MAX,Yes. No. Ugh!,3
LORELAI,"Do you want an aspirin? I probably have a. . .Tic Tac. Sorry, I shouldn't have teased you with that aspirin thing.",3
MAX,"You know, I thought we were both going to just pretend to ignore the kiss. Wasn't that the deal?",3
LORELAI,We had a deal? I don't rememb er a deal.,3
MAX,"You had your shot, okay? You had the ring and you said no.",3
LORELAI,"Yes, I did. And you said that that was right for you, too. You went to Stanford, you dated Diane, it was right for both of us.",3
MAX,"Well, what is this, now, right here?",3
LORELAI,It's us. Tada.,3
MAX,"Well, us needs to stay apart.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, Max, we had a whole country between us for a year. That's like eleven-thousand basketball players lying end to end, and yet, here we are. We can't avoid each other.",3
MAX,"I thought I was over you. I thought it was safe to come back here, but no, not the deal. I just, I think we should stay apart and never see each other ever again.",3
LORELAI,That's impossible.,3
MAX,"No, it's not.",3
LORELAI,"Well, I'll be at the Chilton graduation and so will you.",3
MAX,"Well, I'll sit behind a tree.",3
LORELAI,We could run into each other at a drugstore again.,3
MAX,"Well, I'm gonna order all my dr*gs online.",3
LORELAI,"If my car breaks down next to yours, will you stop?",3
MAX,"I will stop, and keep my eyes straight forward, call a garage and then stay in my car with the radio on really loud 'til they come, and then I'm gone. And I say we start being apart right now.",3
LORELAI,Okay. Whatever you want.,3
MAX,"This is what I want. And when I walk out that door, it could very well be the last time we see each other.",3
LORELAI,Okay. I'll abide by your wishes.,3
MAX,"Goodbye, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,"Goodbye, Max.",3
LORELAI,You said you were leaving.,3
MAX,My car is that way.,3
LORELAI,"Well, I have to go that way, too.",3
MAX,After you.,3
LORELAI,"Two seconds, we've already run into each other.",3
MAX,,3
RORY,"Young Chui, have you seen Jess? YOUNG",3
CHUI,"Uh, I think I saw him go upstairs. Have you seen Lane?",3
RORY,Not for awhile. She's probably with the band. Why don't you go see? YOUNG,3
CHUI,"Oh, I don't wanna lose these seats.",3
RORY,"Right, right.",3
KYLE,"It's just me an d Marshall, Mom, honest. . . okay, kiss Uncle Newtie for me. Bye.",3
LANE,Hey Kyle. Mind if I use your phone there?,3
KYLE,As long as it's local.,3
LANE,"Oh, it's local distance, yeah, don't worry.",3
KYLE,Okay.,3
LANE,"Hello, Mama? Hi, how are you doing tonight?. . .It's Lane. Yeah, Lane. . . Nothing's wrong. In fact, I'm feeling pretty good right now. Had a beer and a half, nice cold beer. And I just thought I'd tell you, I'm drummin g in a band tonight at a party and we rocked. We were The Clash and Rage Against the Machine and Nirvana combined. And I'm in love with Dave Rygalski. He's myguy, not Young Chui. Young Chui's a ship in the night, Mama. Not even a ship, he's a little tugboat tooting along and I'm not gonna go to the prom with him, unh uh. I'm going with Dave, because we rock together, Mama. The charade is over.",3
LANE,Hey.,3
DAVE,What are you doing?,3
LANE,"What I should've done months ago, Davey.",3
DAVE,That was not your mother. Tell me that wasn't your mother.,3
LANE,"Oh, that was the mother. I am liberated, my friend.",3
DAVE,You're drunk.,3
LANE,"No, I'm. . .am I?",3
DAVE,We're going on in five minutes. Can you even play?,3
LANE,"Oh, I can hit the sticks on those brums.",3
DAVE,"Great, great, but what about the drums?",3
LANE,Dave.,3
RORY,There you are.,3
JESS,Hey.,3
RORY,I've been looking all over for you.,3
JESS,Just got tired of everything down there.,3
RORY,"Are we allowed to be up here? I mean, Kyle was kind of discouraging it.",3
JESS,"When you have a party, you get what you get.",3
RORY,"Yeah, I guess. Sad boy, what's wrong? You were looking forward to this party, what happened?",3
JESS,Nothing.,3
RORY,"Something did. Come on, tell me. You're not tired of me, are you? That's a pretty good answer.",3
RORY,"Jess, wait. . . Jess, wait. . . Jess.",3
JESS,Jeez.,3
RORY,"Not here, not now.",3
JESS,Fine.,3
RORY,What's wrong with you?,3
JESS,Nothing's wrong with me.,3
RORY,Someone could've walked in that door.,3
JESS,"And Santa Claus could come down the chimney, whatever.",3
RORY,"You did not think that it was going to happen like this, did you?",3
JESS,I don't know what I think anymore.,3
RORY,Jess.,3
JESS,"Rory, stop, just stop! I did not invite you up here, you came up here on your own!",3

DAVE,"Young Chui, we gotta talk. YOUNG",3
CHUI,"Don't touch me, Dave.",3

KYLE,Get the wrapper.,3
MARSHALLorelai,What wrapper?,3
KYLE,The Tootsie Roll wrapper.,3
MARSHALLorelai,What Tootsie Roll wrapper?,3
KYLE,The one at your feet.,3
MARSHALLorelai,I don't see it.,3
KYLE,It's right there.,3
MARSHALLorelai,Where?,3
KYLE,"Marshall, stop arguing with me, my parents are watching.",3
LORELAI,Have you see these guys? They're hilarious.,3
RORY,"I got it, we can go.",3
LORELAI,Why are you holding it like that?,3
RORY,"Because when Lane left it here last night, it was a very different color.",3
LORELAI,Are you sure she's gonna want that back? It's been left alone all night at a keg party. There's no getting it over that. That backpack is permanently scarred. That backpack is Zelda Fitzgerald.,3
Posted,05/17/03 21:09,3
RORY,"Well, Zelda's going home.",3
LORELAI,Okay. Your first cop-raided party. I am just so proud.,3
RORY,Mom.,3
LORELAI,I just wish I could've been there.,3
RORY,It was no big deal.,3
LORELAI,Did they bring the paddywagon?,3
RORY,"Yeah, but then we snuck out the backdoor of the speak-easy and headed straight for the Algonquin.",3
LORELAI,How was Benchley?,3
RORY,Drunk again.,3
LORELAI,"So tell me mo re about this party last night. I mean, I know the end, but what happened in the middle?",3
RORY,"Lane's band played, they were great, and then people just hung out and talked, and then, uh, there was some sort of fight, I guess. The cops came, that's it.",3
LORELAI,Hm.,3
LORELAI,"Hey, Luke.",3
LUKE,"I'm in bed. I have ten more minutes to sleep. Not a lot of time in the grand scheme of things, but still, ten minutes is ten minutes. You know what I mean.",3
LORELAI,"Sure, yeah.",3
RORY,Ten minutes is great.,3
LUKE,"And then the phone rings, and it just rings and rings and rings and rings, so I pick it up.",3
LORELAI,And then hopefully got your hearing checked.,3
LUKE,Can I finish my story?,3
LORELAI,"I'm just saying, that's a lot of rings.",3
LUKE,"And on the other end of the phone is someone named John who says he's Kyle's father, and Kyle threw a party last night without permission. And two guys got into a fight and tore the place apart, so John wants me to come down and take a look at the damage and discuss some sort of solution to the problem of the damages. Now, I don't know John, and I certainly don't know Kyle, but I do know someone who would get into a fight at a party and leave the place completely trashed. It's a wild guess, but I think his name rhymes with Tess. So here I am, heading in there to talk to John about Kyle and discuss what is to be done about the Hummel.",3
LORELAI,The what?,3
LUKE,Exactly.,3
LORELAI,"Uh, so let's get back to the party recap. Any little details you wanna tell Mommy?",3
RORY,Jess and Dean got into the fight.,3
LORELAI,Over you.,3
RORY,I was a contributing factor.,3
LORELAI,Was anyone hurt?,3
RORY,No.,3
LORELAI,And that's why the cops came and broke up the party?,3
RORY,Yes.,3
LORELAI,So not only did you go to a cop-raided party but you started the raid?,3
RORY,Yes.,3
LORELAI,"This fence is broken because of you, this crap is on the ground because of you.",3
RORY,What's your point?,3
LORELAI,Did you ever know that you're my hero?,3
RORY,Oh my God!,3
LORELAI,,3
DENNIS,"Oh, these muffins, they're brilliant.",3
PEG,Tell us you sell your muffin mix.,3
LORELAI,"Sookie, these people wanna throw roses at your feet.",3
SOOKIE,And I will let them.,3
PEG,"Listen, Sookie, Dennis and I and a bunch of us others wondered if you offered cooking classes.",3
SOOKIE,Cooking classes?,3
DENNIS,Some of the better B&B's have them on the itinerary.,3
SOOKIE,"Oh, of course they do. So, we do, too.",3
PEG,We will be your disciples.,3
SOOKIE,"Oh my gosh, we're gonna have so much fun. We'll start with some spreads and jams, and if there's time - desserts. I have this chocolate balm. . .oh, but breads. . .and soups!",3
LORELAI,"Um, Sookie, hon, we don't have a kitchen.",3
SOOKIE,"Oh, right.",3
PEG,There's no kitchen?,3
SOOKIE,"Okay, not a problem. You'll all come to my house.",3
PEG,Can't wait.,3
DENNIS,Cheers.,3
LORELAI,"Uh, make a note - if the guests are gonna wear those robes downstairs, we need to buy ones with thicker material.",3
SOOKIE,Really.,3
LORELAI,Seeing the sunlight hit Dennis gave me a whole new respect for Peg.,3
SOOKIE,"Hey, listen, uh, Jackson's up in Rochester today helping his cousin rebuild his Nova. He's not getting home 'til late, so you know what that makes me?",3
LORELAI,Available.,3
SOOKIE,Like an intern.,3
LORELAI,Oh.,3
SOOKIE,What are you and Rory doing tonight?,3
LORELAI,I'm open. Rory's got plans with the grandparents.,3
SOOKIE,I didn't know you guys were back in touch.,3
LORELAI,"I'm not, Rory is.",3
SOOKIE,Ah.,3
LORELAI,"Mmhmm, yeah.",3
SOOKIE,"Well, at least the family pressure's off you now. That's good, right?",3
LORELAI,"I don't know. I mean, before this whole Friday night dinner thing, I didn't see them regularly and we didn't talk regularly, so it wasn't weird when I didn't see them or talk to them regularly.",3
SOOKIE,You miss them.,3
LORELAI,"No, I just feel like I'm not doing something I'm supposed to do. I feel guilty.",3
SOOKIE,So what are you gonna do about it?,3
LORELAI,I'm gonna hope it passes.,3
SOOKIE,,3
PRIEST,"Blessed are they who mourn, for they will be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are they. . .",3
RORY,Hey.,3
LANE,Hi.,3
RORY,"So, how are you? How were things last night?",3
LANE,"You mean, after my drunken call to my mother?",3
RORY,Yeah. What happened when you got home?,3
LANE,I'm not sure.,3
RORY,What do you mean you're not sure?,3
LANE,"Well, after I finished with my Farelly brothers' audition in the bushes - thank you for the hair-holding, by the way.",3
RORY,Anytime.,3
LANE,"Dave dropped me off at home. He wanted to come in, but he's an only child and I saw no reason for his family line to end with him, so I went in and he left.",3
RORY,And?,3
LANE,The place was dark.,3
RORY,No Mrs. Kim?,3
LANE,No Mrs. Kim.,3
RORY,No Mrs. Kim.,3
LANE,"So, of course, I panicked. What does this mean? I mean, when I come home ten minutes late from bible study, she has a cow. But I call her drunk, tell her I'm at a party, I'm a drummer in a band, and I'm in love with a non-Korean. . .I expected there to be backup - aunts, uncles, cousins pulled out from villages I've never heard of, but nothing.",3
RORY,I don't understand.,3
LANE,So I go upstairs to make sure everything's okay. I look in her room and she's in bed asleep.,3
RORY,No.,3
LANE,"Then this morning, I get up, I go in the kitchen where she's making breakfast and I say, ""Good morning, Mama.""",3
RORY,And?,3
LANE,"She turns around, looks right at me and says, ""Good morning, Lane.""",3
RORY,Really?,3
LANE,And those were the last words she's said to me all day.,3
RORY,So she's freezing you out?,3
LANE,"No, it was more Stepford than cold. You know, very calm, very serene.",3
RORY,"Okay, well, let's think. Maybe she didn't hear you.",3
LANE,"I was drunk, I could've slurred.",3
RORY,"Exactly. Maybe she thought you said you were at a smarty, playing clock music, drinking fear, and in love with Rave Smitchalsky.",3
LANE,And how would that be better?,3
RORY,It's much less clear.,3
LANE,What is that smell?,3
RORY,Your backpack.,3
PRIEST,Blessed are they which are pers -,3
PRIEST,"Uh, blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs are the Kingdom of Heaven.",3
RORY,"You have to talk to her, Lane.",3
LANE,I can't talk to her.,3
RORY,"Well, what are you going to do?",3
LANE,"Well, first off, I volunteered to work this table for the next two months. Plus, I told her I'd go to that Seventh Day Adventist college in Hartford and live at home.",3
RORY,"Lane, no.",3
LANE,And I told Dave to forget about the prom. There's no way that's gonna happen.,3
RORY,I'm sorry.,3
LANE,"Don't be, it's my fault.",3
PRIEST,"And utter every kind of evil against you falsely because of me, Amen. Okay, let's go. Sorry, David.",3
RABBI,,3
WOMAN,"Excuse me, I'd like some ham.",3
JESS,Be right back.,3
WOMAN,But I'd like some ham! MAN 1: Is this what I ordered?,3
JESS,"Yes. Know what you want yet? MAN 2: Oh, uh, no, not yet.",3
JESS,You know what might help? MAN 2: What?,3
JESS,"Opening the menu. MAN 2: Yes, thank you for the tip.",3
JESS,I need ham.,3
CAESARory,No ham.,3
JESS,We got a shipment of ham yesterday.,3
CAESARory,No ham.,3
JESS,"Caesar, there's a lady over there that has been saying she wants ham for the last twenty minutes and if I go back there empty handed, there's a fifty-fifty chance that she will eat me.",3
CAESARory,No ham.,3
JESS,"Then sew some bacon together 'cause that woman is getting ham. MAN 1: Excuse me, I don't think this is what I. . . Thank you.",3
JESS,"Who ordered this? Look in front of you. If there is nothing there and there should be, then this is yours.",3
KIRK,"Oh, here.",3
JESS,Well? MAN 2: What?,3
JESS,You know what you want yet? MAN 2: I'll just have more coffee.,3
JESS,More coffee coming up. Glad to make your dining dreams come true.,3
TAYLORory,"""Oh, who can take a sunrise, sprinkle it with dew. Cover it in chocolate and a miracle or two, the candy man. Oh, the candy man can!"" Yes, that's right, the candy man can 'cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good, and I, ladies and gentlemen, am the candy man. Your candy man. I'm mixin g it with love and making Stars Hollow taste good.",3
JESS,Move.,3
TAYLORory,"Uh, in a second Jess. Give him a taffy. I come to announce to one and all that the day we all thought would never get here has arrived.",3
KIRK,Arbor Day?,3
TAYLORory,No.,3
KIRK,The Day of Reckoning?,3
TAYLORory,No,3
KIRK,The day the music died?,3
TAYLORory,Kirk.,3
KIRK,Give me a t affy.,3
TAYLORory,What?,3
KIRK,I've got a million of 'em. Give me a taffy!,3
TAYLORory,"As I was saying, the big day has arrived. The opening of Taylor's Old Fashioned Soda Shoppe and Candy Store! Tomorrow from noon to six, there will be fun, balloons, ice cream, and old fashioned penny candy for just one dollar a piece. Come at noon, stay all day. . .",3
JESS,Where the hell have you been? The place is a freaking zoo. Every table's full and I've gotSammy Davis Jr. here thinking it's the Desert Inn.,3
LUKE,I had to run an errand.,3
JESS,"Everybody's complaining, we're out of ham, Caesar's suddenly decided to join the Slow Food Movement, and I've got a guy who's moved in at a table for four. He just sits, making it impossible for me to turn over that table, and if I can't turn over that table, then that cuts way back on my tips.",3
LUKE,"I'm sorry, don't you mean my tips?",3
JESS,What?,3
LUKE,You know where I was this morning?,3
JESS,No.,3
LUKE,I was at Kyle's. His parents called me this morning.,3
JESS,"Oh, yeah?",3
LUKE,"Seems a little party you went to last night got a little Animal House, huh?",3
JESS,Dean started it.,3
LUKE,"Oh, you're not really gonna use that one, are you?",3
JESS,"Well, he did. He sucker punched me and I was just defending myself.",3
LUKE,"Oh, apparently you defended yourself all the way through the house and out into the front yard. You defended yourself with a chair that is now broken. You defended yourself with a coffee table. You defended yourself with an ottoman.",3
JESS,I don't need a recap.,3
LUKE,Do you have any idea how much damage you caused?,3
JESS,"Dean caused it, too.",3
LUKE,The place was trashed.,3
JESS,"Dean trashed it, too.",3
LUKE,Are you trying to k*ll me?,3
JESS,"Nope, it'll just be a perk.",3
LUKE,"Okay, well, here's the deal. From now on, every cent that you make here goes toward paying them back.",3
JESS,"Hey, what about -",3
LUKE,Dean's paying them back also.,3
JESS,How do you know?,3
LUKE,Because he was at Kyle's house when I got there.,3
JESS,You're kidding me.,3
LUKE,He had already worked out a financial agreement with the parents and was helping them put a fence back up.,3
JESS,"Man, he's gonna make some w oman a fine doormat someday.",3
LUKE,"You are making good on this, Jess.",3
JESS,I have to get more coffee out of the store room.,3
LUKE,Every cent is getting paid back. I never want those people calling me again.,3
LUKE,,3
LORELAI,"Okay, here's the problem. Every single one of my skirts is either too long or too short for this season's acceptable lengths. Which means I either have to alter or shop.",3
RORY,To be or not to be.,3
LORELAI,"Just wait 'til you hear what InStyle thinks of you, young lady. What time are you getting home tonight?",3
RORY,"We have to go over the special graduation edition of the Franklin, and of course we're completely behind, partly because Paris can't let anything go to print unless she's proofed it a million times. Can you say crazy a**l micromanager?",3
LORELAI,Not five times fast.,3
RORY,I'll be home by ten.,3
LORELAI,That's all I needed to know.,3
RORY,I forgot my notes.,3
LORELAI,I put them in your bedroom.,3
EMILY,Hello?,3
LORELAI,"Hi, Mom.",3
EMILY,Lorelai?,3
LORELAI,"Yup, it's me. So, how are you?",3
EMILY,I'm fine.,3
LORELAI,Good. How's Dad?,3
EMILY,He's fine.,3
LORELAI,Also good.,3
EMILY,May I speak with Rory please?,3
LORELAI,"No, you can't speak with Rory.",3
EMILY,Why not?,3
LORELAI,Because I called you.,3
EMILY,So what?,3
LORELAI,You don't get to request a switch when a person calls you.,3
EMILY,I'm sure she's standing right there.,3
LORELAI,"Not the point. If you wanna talk to Rory, you have to call. Then when I answer the phone, you can ask for Rory. But you didn't call, I called, so you cannot ask for Rory.",3
EMILY,"What do you want, Lorelai?",3
LORELAI,I just wanted to see how you were. I haven't seen you for awhile.,3
EMILY,Your choice.,3
LORELAI,"No, your choice, Mom.",3
EMILY,You're the one who called off Friday night dinners.,3
LORELAI,"No, I'm the one who called off the obligation for Friday night dinners. You're the one who called off. . .ugh, you know what, I didn't call to argue.",3
EMILY,"Fine, let's not argue.",3
LORELAI,"Come on, Mom, this is silly. I mean, think back to before the whole Friday night dinner thing. We still had a relationship.",3
EMILY,"You mean the one where I would trick you into calling me by leaving a message on your answering machine saying I had something important to tell you, but I wouldn't include the details so you had no choice but to call me.",3
LORELAI,Yes.,3
EMILY,"And then when you did call, we'd talk about the weather, you'd ask about the DAR, and then you'd put Rory on the phone, even when she was too young to talk.",3
LORELAI,It was not always like that.,3
EMILY,"It was always like that. Very well. The weather's fine, the DAR is staging a luncheon at the library next week. You already said I couldn't talk to Rory, so there, I think you've fulfilled your obligation.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, Mom, fine. Have a nice day.",3
EMILY,Same to you.,3
LORELAI,,3
RORY,"Sorry, sorry, sorry.",3
PARIS,The issue is a disaster. It's our last issue of the Franklin and it's a complete disaster.,3
RORY,I'm sure it's not that bad.,3
PARIS,"And that's why you won't need to Botox your frown lines on your nineteenth birthday. Not that picture, no, put it down. Put it down now!",3
RORY,How's it coming?,3
LOUISE,Very frustrating.,3
MADELINE,We just can't seem to get exactly the right combination.,3
LOUISE,"All right. How about blue dress, blonde guy, black limo? Works best for me.",3
MADELINE,"Yes, however, green dress, red-haired guy, white limo works best for me.",3
LOUISE,White limo with blonde guy totally doesn't work. It's too washed up.,3
RORY,I'm assuming this conversation veered off of the cover page placement?,3
MADELINE,"How about black-haired guy, green dress and tan limo?",3
LOUISE,Tan limo?,3
MADELINE,Good neutral backdrop.,3
LOUISE,"Well, this opens up a whole new set of options. Bring the golf team back in.",3
RORY,"Okay, why don't I just get these pesky Franklin articles out of your way. There we go.",3
PARIS,What are you doing?,3
RORY,I am working on the front page placement.,3
PARIS,What are they doing?,3
RORY,Staying true to who they are.,3
LOUISE,"Look, prom is once. It happens, it's photographed, and then it's there forever.",3
MADELINE,Planning is essential.,3
LOUISE,"By the way, Paris, we left a space for you in the limo. However, we're gonna need the color of your dress.",3
MADELINE,And a picture of Jamie.,3
LOUISE,And the amount of flexibility that you have with the color of your dress.,3
MADELINE,And with Jamie.,3
PARIS,"Thank you, but we've already made our plans for prom night. Jamie hired a private car to drive us to the prom. We'll go in, take the picture, depending on the level of lameness, dance. Then he's taking me to dinner at Antoine's, followed by a helicopter ride to join his parents out in Martha's Vineyard for the weekend.",3
MADELINE,What color's the helicopter?,3
PARIS,"As you were. So, have you figured out your plans for prom night yet?",3
RORY,"Oh, no, but Stars Hollow is a much more casual kind of a prom. Less Cinderella, more Footloose.",3
PARIS,Still a prom.,3
RORY,It is still a prom.,3
PARIS,,3
LORELAI,It's my own fault. I poked a slumbering bear with a stick. I reached out and initiated contact with Emily Gilmore. I get what I deserve.,3
SOOKIE,You're a bad girl.,3
LORELAI,You know what really stinks? They're having Rory over tonight for a movie night.,3
SOOKIE,Movie night? That's your thing with her.,3
LORELAI,"Exactly. What's next? ""Stay home and dance around in your underwear to the Monkees' greatest hits"" night?",3
SOOKIE,"I wouldn't put it past them to steal that, too.",3
LORELAI,What's going on?,3
LORELAI,Oh my God.,3
SOOKIE,Fran.,3
LORELAI,Poor thing.,3
SOOKIE,I don't believe it.,3
LORELAI,Such a great lady.,3
SOOKIE,Great lady.,3
LORELAI,Eighty-three on her last birthday. A good long life.,3
SOOKIE,We should all be so lucky.,3
LORELAI,I'm gonna miss her.,3
SOOKIE,"Me, too. So. . .",3
LORELAI,Yeah?,3
SOOKIE,I guess this'll put that old inn of hers on the market.,3
LORELAI,"Right, right. I mean, she wanted to keep it as long as she was alive, and now. . .",3
SOOKIE,Oh my God.,3
LORELAI,What?,3
SOOKIE,"You don't think that because we wanted the property so much, we k*lled Fran.",3
LORELAI,What?,3
SOOKIE,Through the power of our minds.,3
LORELAI,"No, no, we wished for the property, not this!",3
SOOKIE,"Yeah, but you never know with karma.",3
LORELAI,"Look, we loved Fran, right?",3
SOOKIE,"Yes, we did.",3
LORELAI,And whether or not we get the Dragonfly Inn has nothing to do with her dying right now.,3
SOOKIE,Right. . .sort of.,3
LORELAI,"Besides, we don't know what's happening with the inn.",3
SOOKIE,Fran has no heirs.,3
LORELAI,"You never know. Some long lost gold-toothed cousin could come out of the woodwork, inherit it and turn it into a beauty salon or law offices.",3
SOOKIE,Not our Dragonfly!,3
LORELAI,"The point is, if we are meant to have the Dragonfly Inn, then we are meant to have it.",3
SOOKIE,Right. Like Doris Day.,3
LORELAI,Que sera.,3
SOOKIE,Sera.,3
LORELAI,Let's focus on Fran and how much we loved her. Not think about the inn at all.,3
SOOKIE,Okay.,3
LORELAI,You're thinking about it.,3
SOOKIE,Just about where to put the woodburning oven.,3
LORELAI,We'll put it in the apartment that we're sharing in hell.,3
SOOKIE,Let's buy flowers.,3

LANE,"Yes, Mama.",3

DAVE,I'm here to see your mother.,3
LANE,What?,3
DAVE,Excuse me.,3
LANE,"Dave, Dave, wait!",3
DAVE,,3
KIM,"I'm busy, David.",3
DAVE,"A few weeks ago you told me that Lane had a crush on me. Well, I have a crush on her, too. Now, I know you have very strict rules about dating and boys, but I just want you to know that I'm a good person. I don't smoke, I don't drink, I've never gotten a ticket, I'm healthy, I take care of myself, I floss. I never watch more than 30 minutes of television a night partly because I think it's a waste of time an d partly because there's nothing on. I respect my parents, I do well in school, I never play video games in case they do someday prove that playing them can turn you into a serial k*ller. I don't drink coffee. I hate soda because the carbonation freaks me out. I'm happy to give up meat if you feel strongly about it. I don't mind wearing a tie. I enjoy playing those hymns on my guitar, and I really, really want to take your daughter to the prom.",3
DAVE,,3
KIM,"Let never day nor night unhallow'd pass, but still remember what the Lord hath done.",3
DAVE,"Okay, thank you.",3
DAVE,Did you hear what she said?,3
LANE,"Yes, I did.",3
DAVE,What did it mean?,3
LANE,I don't know.,3
DAVE,"Was it a yes, was it a no?",3
LANE,I'm not sure.,3
DAVE,"Well, it's gotta be from the bible, right? So I'll just go home, do some research, look on the Internet, see what I can find. I'll call you when I know something.",3
LANE,Okay.,3
LANE,,3
LUKE,Left your wallet in the diner.,3
JIMMY,"Oh, wow, did I? Look at that. I guess I did. Thanks for bringing it back.",3
LUKE,No problem.,3
JIMMY,"You know, I really like this driver's license picture, too, so you could imagine what a drag it would be to have to replace it.",3
LUKE,"So what are you doing here, Jimmy?",3
JIMMY,Just passing through.,3
LUKE,Passing through from where?,3
JIMMY,California.,3
LUKE,California?,3
JIMMY,"Yeah, I've been there for a few years now, seems to be working out.",3
LUKE,"Well, glad to hear it.",3
JIMMY,Yeah.,3
LUKE,"So what are you doing here, Jimmy?",3
JIMMY,"Nothing, really, just. . .",3
LUKE,He hasn't missed you.,3
JIMMY,I'm sure that he hasn't.,3
LUKE,Never says a word about you.,3
JIMMY,I wouldn't expect he would.,3
LUKE,"Do you know why he doesn't miss you, Jimmy? Because you're a loser and nobody missed a loser.",3
JIMMY,"It's been seventeen years, Luke.",3
LUKE,"Oh, you rememb er how long it's been. I am impressed.",3
JIMMY,"Yeah, well, I always could count.",3
LUKE,And your list of attributes ends there.,3
JIMMY,"Okay, so I guess we're not playing nice anymore.",3
LUKE,"You know, the last time I saw you is right after Liz gave birth. You were gonna go out and buy some diapers and meet us back at the apartment. Remember that?",3
JIMMY,Yes.,3
LUKE,"You went out, but you never came back.",3
JIMMY,A lot of time has passed and a lot of things have changed.,3
LUKE,"Really, like what things? You?",3
JIMMY,"Yes, me. Maybe. Why not?",3
LUKE,"Oh, come on, you never called before. Why now? What do you want, you need money?",3
JIMMY,What?,3
LUKE,'Cause he doesn't have any.,3
JIMMY,I don't need money.,3
LUKE,I don't have any either.,3
JIMMY,I don't need money.,3
LUKE,So the look is a choice?,3
JIMMY,"No, I just wanted to. . .I don't know, see him.",3
LUKE,Why now?,3
JIMMY,"I don't know, I just thought it was time. You don't think it was time?",3
LUKE,You really want my opinion on this subject?,3
JIMMY,"Luke, give me a b reak.",3
LUKE,"Give you a break? I am trying to keep this kid from falling off the face of the Earth. I'm trying to get him through school. I'm trying to give him a future. And I gotta be totally honest with you, Jimmy - I am not doing too well.",3
JIMMY,No?,3
LUKE,"No, and the last thing he needs is a special appearance by his father who can't be here for any good reason.",3

LUKE,"What? Say hello, see if he looks like you? Then what?",3
JIMMY,Well. . .,3
LUKE,What?,3
JIMMY,I don't know!,3
LUKE,"Okay, well, while you're figuring it out, let me plant this little thought in your head - you do or say anything to upset Jess and make it harder for me to keep him on the right path, I'm gonna put your head through a wall. Any wall, you can pick the wall, but it's gonna be a wall, okay?",3
JIMMY,I just wanted to see him.,3
LUKE,,3
LORELAI,"You know, Fran was one of the first people I met when we moved here.",3
RORY,I know.,3
LORELAI,"The first day here, I stopped in. . .",3
RORY,And asked her for directions to the inn.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah. She was so sweet. And oh my God, she loved you. I didn't think she was gonna let me leave the bakery with you. She just kept giving you cookies in a shameless attempt to buy your affections away from me. And let me tell you, for a couple weeks, it worked. For two weeks, you just kept staring at me like, ""You're the lady who took me away from the cookies. I'm gonna k*ll you.""",3
RORY,"Mom, can I just meet you at the church?",3
LORELAI,"Why, what are you planning? Is it finally payback time?",3
RORY,"I just need to stop in at Doose's and get something. Kleenex, we'll need Kleenex.",3
LORELAI,"Aw, I'll come w ith you.",3
RORY,"Um, well. . .",3
LORELAI,,3

PRIEST,"Welcome al l. The large number of people here today is a testament to how much Fran Weston has touched each and every one of us. We'd like to start by inviting Marjorie Rogers, Fran's close friend, to share a few words with us.",3
MARJORIE,"In 1955, Fran opened Weston's Bakery. Back then, she was the new kid on the block, and soon thereafter, she hired me, a mother of three rugrats and a husband overseas, and we became best friends. Still are.",3
LORELAI,That's so sweet.,3
SOOKIE,You think we'll still be friends when we're dead?,3
LORELAI,I will if you will.,3
MARJORIE,"Fran was and is Stars Hollow. And to ensure that her love and spirit continue, Weston's Bakery will remain open and run by those who have Fran's heart in their hearts.",3
MARJORIE,"Of course, Fran's family has been here long before even Fran. They opened the Dragonfly Inn back in 1893. The Dragonfly Inn was once regarded as the Violet Lady, the premiere inn in all of . . ..",3
LORELAI,What'd she say?,3
SOOKIE,"I heard ""premiere inn"" then squat.",3

RORY,"You guys, people are turning.",3
MARJORIE,. . .to you all.,3
SOOKIE,Did she say who gets the inn?,3
LORELAI,I don't know.,3
PRIEST,"Uh, thank you, Marjorie. And now, I'd like to point out that the time is twelve p.m., the time Fr an would normally be opening her doors on Sunday after church, welcoming us to join her in friendship at Weston's Bakery. So, if we may at this time all bow our heads for a minute of silence to mark the passing of the soul and our dear departed friend.",3
TAYLORory,,3
PRIEST,,3
KIM,Walking with dead people not my thing. Let's go.,3
RORY,Where's Sookie?,3
LORELAI,Just giving our condolences.,3
RORY,And asking what you missed when the mike cut out?,3
LORELAI,And giving our condolences.,3
SOOKIE,The man in the suit's name is Brink. He's a lawyer and he's here to get Fran's affairs in order.,3
LORELAI,Do you think we can talk to him?,3
SOOKIE,"Yes, but Lorelai, you have to get back to the inn and I've got those B&Bers waiting at my home to learn how to make jam.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, well, let's get him now.",3
SOOKIE,I think our window of opportunity just slammed shut.,3
LORELAI,Great.,3
SOOKIE,Now what?,3
LORELAI,We very respectfully hover in his vicinity until the walk is over. . .,3
SOOKIE,Then we will politely ask him to get in touch with us.,3
LORELAI,Yes. Coming?,3
RORY,"No, you guys go ahead. I'll be in the back of the line so that when the earth opens up and swallows you whole, I'll be here to tell a story.",3
LORELAI,,3
DEAN,"Hey, Rory.",3
RORY,"Oh, hey. You were in there?",3

DEAN,Why not now?,3
RORY,"Well, you're eighteen, first of all.",3
DEAN,So?,3
RORY,"So, you're young. I mean, you haven't even gone to college yet. Oh my God, you are still going to college, aren't you?",3
DEAN,"Yes, Rory, I'm still going to college.",3
RORY,"Well, how. . .",3
DEAN,Lindsay's gonna go with me.,3
RORY,"But Dean, you're going to be studying and taking classes, you need to focus on that. I mean, you don't even know what you wanna do yet. And you guys haven't even been going out for that long. I mean, why don't you just date for awhile? Dating's fun.",3
DEAN,Thank you.,3
RORY,For what?,3
DEAN,For your deep heartfelt congratulations.,3

DEAN,"You know what, I'm sorry if you have a crappy relationship with Jess.",3
RORY,"Hey, that has -",3
DEAN,"And I'm sorry if he treats you like dirt and everyone hates him, but that was your choice. I have a great girlfriend and I am really happy, and when you dumped me for that jackass, I thought I'd never be happy again.",3
RORY,Jess does not treat me like dirt.,3
DEAN,"Whatever. I just wanted you to hear it from me before it got out. Now you know, so, um, have a nice life.",3
RORY,,3

KIM,"No, thank you.",3
LANE,,3
KIM,If you like.,3
LANE,,3
KIM,Fine.,3
LANE,"Mama, I'm really sorry about the other night. I did everything wrong, everything you taught me not to do. I lied to you, I let you down. I never intended to do that and I don't know how to fix it, but I'm going to try my hardest because I am so, so sorry. I'll be upstairs if you need me. I'm gonna go in my room, gonna iron my dress for church and I'm gonna think about what I've done.",3

DAVE,,3
KIM,"It's Shakespeare, Henry VI. I like to goof off now and then, too, you know.",3
DAVE,,3
KIM,"That is a very difficult this to do, reading the bible in one night. I myself have only done it three times. You need great determination and excellent light. I'm very impressed. All right.",3
DAVE,,3
KIM,"You can go to the prom, but you cannot get married.",3
DAVE,That seems fair to me.,3
LANE,,3
KIM,Lane is grounded until the prom and for two months after. You may call her on the phone every other day for ten minutes and that is all. Understand?,3

LORELAI,So apparently we're all supposed to walk like Fran.,3
SOOKIE,It's almost four.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, I've gotta take some in itiative here.",3
SOOKIE,What are you doing?,3
LORELAI,Just focus on the ground and look lost in grief.,3
LORELAI,It was a nice service.,3
LAWYERory,Yes.,3
LORELAI,Yes.,3
SOOKIE,"And this is a really nice idea, the walk around the square.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, a great idea. I may steal it when I die. You know, ask them to walk me around a benefit counter. Might freak out the makeover girls, but it's -",3
SOOKIE,It's nice.,3
LORELAI,"Really nice. So listen, my name is Lorelai Gilmore and this is Sookie St. James.",3
SOOKIE,Hi.,3
LORELAI,"I know this isn't exactly the best time for this, but we were wondering if you had any idea what's going to happen with the Dragonfly.",3
SOOKIE,Because we want it!,3
LORELAI,Sookie and I actually talked to Fran about buying it once.,3
SOOKIE,We work in the Independence Inn now.,3
LAWYERory,The one that burned down?,3
LORELAI,"Yes, but that was just an accident. It was a bad wire.",3
SOOKIE,"A bad, bad wire.",3
LORELAI,It could've happened to anyone and should in no way reflect our inn-running abilities.,3
LAWYERory,"Yes, well, do you think we could discuss this a little later? This is a little heavy and I sort of need to focus.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, let me help you here. Ooh, wow, for a little woman. . .Sookie, will you just. . .",3
SOOKIE,"Oh, right.",3
LORELAI,"Anyway, we were just wondering, did she leave the Dragonfly to anyone?",3
LAWYERory,"No, she didn't.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, okay. And do you know what the family wants to do with it?",3
LAWYERory,"We haven't talked in depth about it, but I'm pretty sure they're gonna sell it.",3
LORELAI,"Well, we would really like to buy it.",3
SOOKIE,And keep it as an inn.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, a wonderful inn.",3
SOOKIE,Dedicated to Fran.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, but keep it the Dragonfly.",3
SOOKIE,And we promise not to burn it down.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, yes, that's right. Hey, we could put that in the agreement. Ow. . .",3
LAWYERory,"Uh, here, why don't you. . .",3
LORELAI,"Thank you. Anyway, what do you say?",3
LAWYERory,Well. . .,3
KIRK,"Excuse me, but you're blocking her view.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, sorry Kirk, sorry. So you were saying?",3
LAWYERory,"I'll tell you what, you contact me on Monday and we can discuss this. As far as I'm concerned, if the check clears, it's all yours.",3
LORELAI,It's all ours.,3
SOOKIE,,3
JESS,We're closed. Learn to read. You're the loser coffee guy.,3
JIMMY,"Well, not as cool as Bono, but I'll take it.",3
JESS,We're -,3
JIMMY,"Closed. Yeah, I heard.",3
JESS,"Okay, so we're still -",3
JIMMY,I'm your father.,3
JESS,- closed. What?,3
JIMMY,I'm your. . .,3
JESS,Are you sure?,3
JIMMY,"Am I. . .yes, I'm sure. I didn't mean to spring this on you. I thought Luke would've told you that I -",3
JESS,Luke would've told me?,3
JIMMY,"Well, yeah, he came to see me last night. He didn't tell you. That's obvious because you're still doing the staring with the frown and. . .you look different.",3
JESS,You want some coffee?,3
JIMMY,Sure. Thanks.,3
JESS,It's old.,3
JIMMY,Okay.,3
JIMMY,,3
LORELAI,I was negotiating at a funeral.,3
RORY,I saw.,3
LORELAI,Which might've been the most inappropriate thing to happen today until that gnat flew into Kirk's mouth and he freaked and dropped the casket.,3
RORY,It was a nice save.,3
LORELAI,"I'm feeling so weird. I'm completely sad about Fran, but the inn. . .it's really gonna happen.",3
RORY,"Yeah, seems like it.",3
LORELAI,"Hey, come here.",3
LORELAI,That one would look great on you.,3
RORY,"Oh, I don't know.",3
LORELAI,We should come back tomorrow and try it on.,3
RORY,Maybe.,3
LORELAI,"Hey, prom's coming up, kid. We need to get you a dress. Unless you want me to make you one.",3
RORY,"No, that's okay.",3
LORELAI,Maybe we could hit the mall tomorrow after school. I could meet you in Hartford and we could go to a fancy store where they'll follow us around like we're thieves.,3
RORY,I don't wanna talk about dresses anymore.,3
LORELAI,We've only been talking about dresses for two minutes.,3
RORY,"Well, it feels like longer.",3
LORELAI,Rory.,3
RORY,"And I don't know if I even need a dress, okay, 'cause I don't even know if I'm going to the prom.",3
LORELAI,I thought Jess agreed.,3
RORY,"Well, that was before.",3
LORELAI,Before what?,3
RORY,"Before the party, before the fight, before the thing in Kyle's bedroom.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, come w ith me.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, we left off with the thing in Kyle's bedroom.",3
RORY,"I don't understand. One minute he's happy, then he's not. And he doesn't tell me anything ever. I mean, you're supposed to tell your girlfriend things. That's the whole point of having a girlfriend, isn't it?",3
LORELAI,"Yes, it is. Now, Kyle's bedroom, what happened there?",3
RORY,And I'm so tired of fighting. Or not even fighting because he won't fight. He just gets mad and disappears and then comes back and I don't like how I feel and I don't like what I do.,3
LORELAI,"Like what you do where, in Kyle's bedroom?",3
RORY,"I don't wanna feel like this, I don't wanna sit around wondering when we're going to talk, if he's mad, why he's mad. I hate this. I really, really -",3
LORELAI,"Honey, you gotta tell Mommy what happened in Kyle's bedroom!",3
RORY,Jess was upset and I went to look for him and we were kissing and then it seemed like he wanted to. . .,3
LORELAI,Did you?,3
RORY,"No, I didn't. And then he got all weird like he was mad at me.",3
LORELAI,"Hey, if he was mad at you because you wouldn't have sex with him, then he's a jerk.",3
RORY,"I know that, but I don't even know if that's why he's mad at me. I don't know if he's mad at me. I don't know anything because he won't talk. He just sulks then disappears, and just when you're through with him, he shows up at hockey games with Distiller tickets.",3
LORELAI,Distiller tickets? What Distiller tickets?,3
RORY,"Oh, that's right, you don't know about that because I didn't tell you because I was embarrassed because I didn't wanna be that girl and you don't want me to be that girl, but after the hockey game, I was that girl.",3
LORELAI,"What girl? Help me, drag me along, honey.",3
RORY,The girl who lets her boyfriend treat her like dirt and then lies to her mom about it.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, you need a breath here.",3
RORY,Something's going on with him and it's been going on for awhile.,3
LORELAI,"You can't make him talk, Rory. He has to want to.",3
RORY,But why doesn't he want to?,3
LORELAI,Because it's probably hard for him.,3
LORELAI,"Hey, we're not leaving. We're gonna live in this car and we're gonna die in this car, so find another frickin' spot. Honey. . .",3
RORY,I don't wanna talk about it anymore. I'm tired of talking about it. I'm just. . .tired.,3
LORELAI,Okay. So. . .,3
RORY,Nothing happened.,3
LORELAI,,3
LUKE,Hey. You hungry? I can make us some eggs.,3
JESS,So I hear you went to see my father last night.,3
LUKE,"Yeah, I did.",3
JESS,Were you gonna tell me?,3
LUKE,He came by?,3
JESS,He came by.,3
LUKE,I didn't think he'd have the guts.,3
JESS,So what were you thinking?,3
LUKE,"Jess, I don't like your father very much.",3
JESS,"So because you don't like him, that means I can't know he's here?",3
LUKE,You know he's here.,3
JESS,No thanks to you.,3
LUKE,Shouldn't have come from me in the first place.,3
JESS,"So what, you don't think you owed it to me to tell me, prepare me?",3
LUKE,"No, Jess, I didn't. With everything that's going on here with you, I kinda hoped he'd just walk away, but. . .once again, Jimmy makes the wrong move. What a shock.",3
JESS,"Oh, who the hell are you to decide what the right move is?",3
LUKE,I'm the one who's saving your ass constantly. I'm the one who just wrote a check to Kyle's father so he wouldn't press charges against you. I'm the one trying to knock some sense into that thick head of yours about the future.,3
JESS,"Oh, here we go.",3
LUKE,"You don't take anything seriously. That's why you're doing so crappy in school. You're smartenough, you read more than anyone I've ever seen. There's no reason why you should be barely graduating.",3
JESS,I'm not.,3
LUKE,You're not what?,3
JESS,I'm not graduating.,3
LUKE,"Yes, you are.",3
JESS,"No, I'm not.",3
LUKE,"Yes, you are.",3
JESS,"No, I'm not.",3
LUKE,"Yes, you are, because we had an agreement that if you were gonna live here, you were gonna go to school and you were gonna graduate.",3
JESS,"Well, I didn't and I'm not.",3
LUKE,"What is wrong with you? What, did you do this just to spite me?",3
JESS,"Look, forget it, it's done.",3
LUKE,"What's your life now? Wal-Mart full time, that's your great future? Gonna take the plunge and buy yourself a second blue vest?",3
JESS,"Maybe, why not? What's wrong with it? I mean, it's no diner.",3
LUKE,"Hey, I own this business, kid! I built it, this is mine! I'm not at the mercy of some boss waiting and hoping to be chosen employee of the month for a couple extra hundred bucks and a plaque. I'm always employee of the month. I'm emp loyee of the year, of the century, of the universe. You should be so lucky to have a job like mine. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. You're gonna live here one more year, you're gonna quit you job, you're gonna take twelfth grade over again, and you will graduate.",3
JESS,No.,3
LUKE,"I'm not playing with you here, Jess. You quit your job, you go to school.",3
JESS,I am not going back to school!,3
LUKE,So that's it?,3
JESS,"Yeah, that's it.",3
LUKE,,3
RORY,I thought I smelled coffee.,3
LORELAI,Good morning your highness. I trust you slept well.,3
RORY,And to what do I owe this lovely display of domesticity?,3
LORELAI,"Well, being brilliant and all, I figured you would probably still not be in the mood to go to Luke's this morning, so I thought we'd have a nice little breakfast here.",3
RORY,"Wow, okay. Hey.",3
LORELAI,Good?,3
RORY,These are from Luke's.,3
LORELAI,What?,3
RORY,"You got up this morning, went to Luke's and brought this back.",3
LORELAI,"Well, I sure as hell am not gonna cook.",3
RORY,"They're good, thank you.",3
LORELAI,Put 'em on a plate just the way you like 'em.,3
RORY,"Well, there it is.",3
LORELAI,"""Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Lister announce the engagement of their daughter Lindsay Ann to Dean Forrester, son of Randy and Barbara Forrester."" My God, they're a good looking couple. If their kids can sing there's no stopping 'em.",3
RORY,I still don't understand why they need to get married.,3
LORELAI,Maybe they have to get married before he grows so tall she won't be able to talk to him anymore.,3
RORY,I really do want him to be happy.,3
LORELAI,I know. You're good in that department.,3
RORY,Some people get married young and everything turns out fine.,3
LORELAI,Absolutely.,3
RORY,That'd be nice.,3
LORELAI,"Well, we'll keep a good thought.",3
RORY,"Hey, here's a picture of Kirk pinned by the casket.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, yeah, that's a good one.",3
RORY,"Man, it's bad enough this had to happen, but his pants splitting on top of it?",3
LORELAI,Yeah. I hope he never takes too close a look at his life.,3
RORY,"Amen. So this goes on the fridge, right?",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, absolutely.",3
RORY,,3
RORY,Hey.,3
JESS,Hey.,3
RORY,Can I sit?,3
JESS,"Uh, sure, sit. I thought you took an earlier bus.",3
RORY,My first class got canceled today.,3
JESS,Oh. So what's been going on?,3
RORY,Nothing much. Fran died.,3
JESS,I heard.,3
RORY,I went to her funeral yesterday.,3
JESS,"Luke went, too.",3
RORY,I saw him there.,3
JESS,Yeah?,3
RORY,He was in the back.,3
JESS,I can't go to the prom. I couldn't get tickets.,3
RORY,Oh.,3
JESS,Sorry.,3
RORY,This is my stop.,3

LORELAI,"Oh, fine. Hey, how important do you think it is to be able to say, ""Help, I'm bleeding from the head""?",3

LORELAI,Two parks.,3
LANE,One for boys and one for girls.,3
RORY,Huh.,3
LANE,"And you know, I had originally thought that this was gonna be a suffocating place with out of date rules and insane restrictions, but boy was I wrong. For example, curfew is up to 9:30. 9:45 if you're going for your Masters. Makeup will be permitted, as long as it identically matches your skin tone. And owning a Rolling Stones CD is no longer grounds for expulsion. You can work the demerits off in the campus clean-up crew.",3

RORY,It's not over.,3
LORELAI,Every kid in that brochure was awkward and panicked. It looked like the Academy Awardaudience during Michael Moore's speech.,3
RORY,"Hey, why don't you add the phrase ""Just sit there and look pretty"" to that list of yours there, okay? I've gotta go back to studying.",3
LORELAI,,3
RORY,Hey.,3
LORELAI,"Oh! Oh, God, Rory, you scared me.",3
RORY,Sorry.,3
LORELAI,I've been sneaking around here like an idiot trying not to wake you up.,3
RORY,I've been up for hours.,3
LORELAI,Why? Did you have a bad dream? The one where you finally meet Christiane Amanpour and she's really stupid?,3
RORY,"No, I realized last night that at this rate, I will never finish all the work I have to do.",3
LORELAI,What work?,3
RORY,"What work? What work, she asks.",3
LORELAI,"Well, you know me an d that dippy Christiane, takes a little while to catch up.",3
RORY,Here.,3
LORELAI,"Things to do before graduation. A list, of course. Study for finals, senior breakfast, senior awards, finish final edition of the Franklin, organize a new student government, convince Paris to give up student gavel.",3
RORY,"Oh, and I forgot - man the yearbook distribution table this afternoon at the stupid Senior Palooza. Unbelievable.",3
LORELAI,"Well, I'll be manning the Booster Club Grad Night table at the same time, so we can feel stupid and abused together.",3
RORY,I can't finish all this and sleep at the same time.,3
LORELAI,"You have to sleep, it's what keeps you pretty.",3
RORY,Who cares if I'm pretty if I fail my finals?,3
LORELAI,"Okay, you've got this so completely backwards. What is all this?",3
RORY,"Hm? Oh, I found that if I focus too much on one subject, I start to get a little punchy. Thisway, when I hit Bolshevik Revolution overload, I just shift over here and, oh, hello, Anne Boleyn is going down, and then when that gets too depressing, it's right over to calculus.",3
LORELAI,"Saving the party subject for last, huh?",3
RORY,This shifting back and forth seems to produce better results.,3
LORELAI,I think you're pushing yourself too hard.,3
RORY,I made out a schedule. Every single moment of every single day from now until graduation is accounted for.,3
LORELAI,You left off the Kiwanis Luncheon.,3
RORY,I did? Are you sure?,3
LORELAI,It's on Monday.,3
RORY,How could I forget the Kiwanis Luncheon? They gave me their scholarship.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, yes, a two hundred and fifty dollar scholarship. That'll keep you in microwave popcorn for a week.",3
RORY,I'll just have to move something around. And I'll have to work Grandma in.,3
LORELAI,Excuse me?,3
RORY,Grandma called and asked if I could come over and help her pick out a dress to wear to my graduation.,3
LORELAI,No.,3
RORY,I have to.,3
LORELAI,"Rory, my mother's been dressing herself for years and she has yet to show up at a function with her bra on the outside of her clothing.",3
RORY,"She asked, I can't say no.",3
LORELAI,Tell her about the koala bears. She'll understand.,3
RORY,Please stop making fun of them. We need every cent we can get. Yale is expensive.,3
LORELAI,I know Yale is expensive.,3
RORY,"Well, we haven't heard from Yale financial aid yet.",3
LORELAI,"We will, relax.",3
RORY,"Well, we had better hear from them soon because I have a deposit to send in for my room and I have a bunch of supplies to buy and I wanna get all of that out of the way before we go to Europe, otherwise I'll be obsessing about it the entire time.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, uh, listen, I'm gonna go out and get the paper.",3
RORY,"Okay, well, don't show it to me because I have no time for recreational reading until June.",3
LORELAI,"Hey, could we move your, uh, chill session from four o'clock tomorrow afternoon to, uh, right now? That'd be great, thanks.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, um, little tip - the whole stalking thing works infinitely better when you don't actually smash your face in the window.",3
LUKE,I need to talk to you.,3
LORELAI,Come in side.,3
LUKE,"No, Rory's in there.",3
LORELAI,"Since when are you scared of Rory? 'Cause seriously, Luke, I think you can take her.",3
LUKE,I just need to tell you something. Can she hear us?,3
LORELAI,"Through the walls? No, I put some kryptonite in her waffles. We're good.",3
LUKE,Come over here.,3
LORELAI,You're freaking out the freaks this morning.,3
LUKE,Jess is gone.,3
LORELAI,What?,3
LUKE,And I don't think he's coming back.,3
LORELAI,What do you mean gone? Like gone gone?,3
LUKE,Exactly like gone gone.,3
LORELAI,But when?,3
LUKE,"Last night, this morning, I don't know. I went up there to get some money out of the safe and I noticed that all of his stuff was gone.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, Luke, I'm so sorry.",3
LUKE,"Yeah, well, forget it. I'm through with him. He's eighteen, he can do whatever the hell he wants. He's on his own, I'm through.",3
LORELAI,Luke.,3
LUKE,"No, it's a relief. That kid was driving me crazy. Let him make his own way from now on. Let him see how far that smart mouth of his gets him without someone watching his back. I couldn't be more relieved. I'm just worried about Rory. I assume she doesn't know.",3
LORELAI,She hasn't said anything.,3
LUKE,I can tell her if you want me to.,3
LORELAI,"No, it's okay. I can do it. I just have to figure out when. She's got a lot of things on her mind right now.",3
LUKE,"Well, don't wait too long. She'll notice eventually.",3
LORELAI,"Yes, okay. Well, thanks for coming over.",3
LUKE,No problem.,3
LORELAI,Luke?,3
LUKE,I failed him.,3
LORELAI,"You did not fail him. You supported him, you defended him, you gave him a chance, and if he chose not to take it, there's nothing more you could do.",3
LUKE,"Yeah. Well, I should go.",3
LORELAI,Do you have any idea where he went?,3
LUKE,"Yeah, I got a pretty good idea.",3
RORY,"Hey, there is no chill time scheduled for four o'clock tomorrow, and the one thing I really don't have time for are your jokes, missy.",3
LORELAI,,3
MAN,"Do you need some help, friend?",3
JESS,Nope.,3
MAN,"Lived here 25 years. I can certainly point you in a direction, make your journey easier. Enjoy this beautiful day.",3
JESS,,3
LORELAI,,3
JESS,"Hey! Hello, is anybody home? Hey!",3
SASHA,Pipe down! You selling something?,3
JESS,No. Does Jimmy Mariano live here?,3
SASHA,Does he owe you money?,3
JESS,"No, I'm his. . .Jess. I'm Jess.",3
SASHA,Jess?,3
JESS,Jess Marian -,3
SASHA,"Frodo, back off now! I'm sorry, what were you saying?",3
JESS,"I just wanna see Jimmy, okay?",3
SASHA,"Hey, did you ever see The Wizard of Oz?",3
JESS,Yes.,3
SASHA,"Rememb er when they go to the Emerald City and they ring the bell and the guy with the beard stuck his head out and they said that they wanted to see the wizard, and he said no, and they said, 'She's got the ruby slippers', and he said 'Well, that's a horse of a different color. Come on in.'",3
JESS,Yes.,3
SASHA,"Well, I'm the guy with the beard and I'm saying the no unless you can come up with the ruby slippers.",3
JESS,I'm his son.,3
SASHA,His son?,3
JESS,"Yes, his son.",3
SASHA,"Well, that's a horse of a different color. Come on in.",3
JESS,Do they bite?,3
SASHA,Just those two.,3
JESS,"Which two? Hey, which two? Great. I swear I will bite you back.",3
SASHA,"I'm sorry, I didn't know you were coming.",3
JESS,Neither did I.,3
SASHA,"I'm Sasha. This is Angus, Chowder, Rufus, Legolas, Caligula, Mudball, General Lee, Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis and Spot. Jimmy's not here right now.",3
JESS,"Okay, well, I can just hang out, walk around for awhile. Just tell me what time he gets home.",3
SASHA,Why don't you come in ? I'll call his work.,3
JESS,"Oh, well. . .",3
JESS,You have a lot of pets.,3
SASHA,"Ah, they're not all mine.",3
JESS,No?,3
SASHA,"No, some of 'em followed me home, some of 'em hang out, some of 'em just needed a place to crash. They drive Jimmy crazy, actually, but what can you do? Someone's gotta take care of 'em, right? I'm just gonna try and track him down, so just wander.",3
SASHA,"Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay. Lee, hi, I'm looking for Jimmy. . . okay, I'll hold. . .",3
JESS,"Clowns, cats, dogs. I wonder where his tap shoes are.",3
JESS,Whoa!,3
SASHA,"He wasn't at work, but his guy said he'll be back any second. Lil, Koko's gonna come overand stay with you while I'm gone, okay? And put those books back in there when you're done, I mean it. Ready?",3
JESS,Yeah.,3
LILY,Hey. . . the door.,3
JESS,,3
LOUISE,Shut up.,3
MADELINE,I swear.,3
LOUISE,Jean jackets are out? How is that possible?,3
MADELINE,I just opened the magazine and there it was.,3
LOUISE,This is horrible. Who decides these things?,3
MADELINE,"Marie Claire, apparently.",3
LOUISE,I feel so helpless. Did you hear? Jean jackets are out.,3
RORY,Out of where?,3
MADELINE,Vogue.,3
LOUISE,"No, Marie Claire.",3
MADELINE,Whatever. We still can't wear them.,3
RORY,"Oh, you guys, thank you so much for passing out the yearbooks for me. I really need the study time.",3
LOUISE,No problem.,3
RORY,Do you want me to at least help you bring the boxes in?,3
MADELINE,"Oh, we've got that taken care of.",3
BOY,Halfway through.,3
LOUISE,"Yeah, well, hurry up, 'cause we need to get started.",3
MADELINE,"God, he carries those boxes sexy.",3
RORY,Hello?,3
EMILY,"Rory, you haven't returned my calls.",3
RORY,"Oh, Grandma, I'm so sorry. I've been really busy.",3
EMILY,"I don't care how busy you get, young lady, you have to call your grandmother back.",3
RORY,I'm sorry.,3
EMILY,"I won't be around forever, you know.",3
RORY,I'm really sorry.,3
EMILY,When are you coming over? I need to discuss what to wear to your graduation. I thought about a suit.,3
RORY,A suit seems nice.,3
EMILY,But perhaps it's too formal.,3
RORY,Formal's fine.,3
EMILY,"Well, what are your friends' families wearing?",3
RORY,I don't know.,3
EMILY,Can you find out?,3
RORY,"Um, sure, hold on. Louise, what's your grandmother wearing to graduation?",3
LOUISE,Hopefully the pearls I get when she kicks.,3
RORY,Why don't I just come over?,3
EMILY,"Oh, that would be wonderful. Today?",3
RORY,"Yes, as soon as I can get away.",3
EMILY,And bring a color swatch of your cap and gown so I don't clash.,3
RORY,"Bye, Grandma.",3
LORELAI,Hello?,3
RORY,I just got another call from Grandma.,3
LORELAI,"Rory, no.",3
RORY,I'm gonna go over there now.,3
LORELAI,And leave me here alone?,3
RORY,Where are you? I can't even see you.,3
LORELAI,I'm over here by the Old Spice ad.,3
RORY,Hi.,3
LORELAI,Hi. Come over.,3
RORY,I have to go.,3
LORELAI,You can't come over and talk for one second?,3
RORY,"The minute I walk into that room, I'm suddenly gonna have to sign yearbooks, and since I'm severely crunched for time, I'm gonna have to resort to classic clams like, ""Hey, have a good summer . Let's keep in touch. Best friends forever,"" and I do not wanna be that person. Plus, Paris will immed iately shanghai me an d give me a million things to do.",3
LORELAI,"You know what, you need to stop being intimidated by that girl. You're going to college for God's sake. You need to be able to stand up for yourself and say, you know, ""Paris, go. . .""",3
PARIS,Hey.,3
LORELAI,Paris!,3
PARIS,What are you doing?,3
LORELAI,I was just. . .the phone rang. . .your hair is really shiny.,3
PARIS,"We're not even set up yet. The box isn't out, the tickets aren't in order. Where's the list?",3
LORELAI,"Uh, it's uh. . .in my purse.",3
PARIS,"Well, terrific. I can't think of a better place for the list to be except, oh, maybe out here on the table where we could actually look at it.",3
LORELAI,Your hair is really shiny.,3
PARIS,I'm going to go make the rounds. I'll be back in a minute. Have you seen Rory?,3
LORELAI,No.,3
PARIS,I'll go look outside.,3
LORELAI,"Run, run, run!",3
RORY,"Okay, I'm gonna be at Grandma's for about an hour. Can you pick me up?",3
LORELAI,"If Paris hasn't had me flogged, then yes, I'll be there.",3
RORY,Thank you. Bye.,3
LORELAI,,3
JESS,So the kid in the bookcase back there. . .,3
SASHA,Lily.,3
JESS,Is she yours?,3
SASHA,"Mine, yes. Not Jimmy's.",3
JESS,Oh.,3
SASHA,"I was married for the longest minute and a half in the world and. . . . . .hey sweetie, how's everything?",3
WOMAN,Everything's fine.,3
SASHA,"I love that. Give Riley a kiss. Then I came to my senses and ran for the hills but I got Lily so I win, ha ha. Short cut. Anyhow, I met Jimmy about five and a half years ago, but Lily's just crazy about him, so. . . . . . Ronnie, I found your keys again.",3
RONNIE,"Oh, good. Thank you, baby doll.",3
SASHA,"You have got to sew that hole in your pocket up, I mean it. Today, drop your coat by my house. I'll do it for you if you don't have the time. Got any brothers or sisters?",3
JESS,Apparently not.,3
SASHA,"Lily submitted a written request for a brother by the end of this year, but I think I should be married before we have any kids.",3
JESS,You guys aren't married.,3
SASHA,You didn't know that.,3
JESS,No.,3
SASHA,"You guys had quite a talk, didn't you?",3
JESS,"Yeah, well.",3
SASHA,,3
JIMMY,Well.,3
LEE,It looks like a jar of pickles.,3
JIMMY,"I know it's a jar of pickles, but is it that jar of pickles?",3
LEE,Yes.,3
JIMMY,You're sure.,3
LEE,No.,3
JIMMY,"Look, the Chicago dills were the original pickles they sold here back in 1922.",3
LEE,"1922. Yes, I listen.",3
JIMMY,"Now I finally tracked down the family that sold them, I paid a substantial premium to use the original labels, I waited weeks for them to arrive, and now they're here and I look at them and they don't look the same. Too many bumps.",3
LEE,"Jimmy, I'm begging you, play golf.",3
JIMMY,"Just call the guy and tell them they look different, please.",3
LEE,Whatever you say.,3
SASHA,Jimmy.,3
JIMMY,Hey Sash.,3
SASHA,You have a visitor.,3
JIMMY,Yeah?,3
JESS,Hey.,3
JIMMY,"Hey. You, uh, just get here?",3
JESS,Just got here.,3
SASHA,"So, Jess, I assume you'll be staying for dinner?",3
JESS,"Oh, well. . .",3
JIMMY,"Yeah, sure, stay. You'll stay. He'll stay. We'll get Abbott's, right?",3
SASHA,"Whatever you want. Well, I have to get back, so I will see you guys later.",3
JESS,Sorry I didn't call.,3
JIMMY,"Hey, life's about the spontaneous, right?",3
JESS,This your place?,3
JIMMY,The Inferno. . .yes.,3
JESS,It's nice.,3
JIMMY,"Thanks. Hey, why don't I come out there?",3
JESS,"Oh, I didn't mean to interrupt your work.",3
JIMMY,"No problem. Hey Lee, I'm gonna take a break for awhile.",3
LEE,Thank God.,3
JESS,You didn't have to do that.,3
JIMMY,"It's fine. So, first time on the West Coast?",3
JESS,First time on the West Coast.,3
JIMMY,Okay. The sites. Ocean.,3
JESS,I wondered what that was.,3
JIMMY,Sand.,3
JESS,Keeps the ocean in its place.,3
JIMMY,Sky.,3
JESS,We've got one of those back east.,3
JIMMY,"And then you have the boardwalk. Sunglasses, smoothies, bootlegged CD's.",3
JESS,Good ones?,3
JIMMY,"Not bad, I guess. I never actually bought one. My neighbor Stan did. He's not my neighbor anymore. He used to work at Lockheed, but they shut down the Burbank plant, so he went to a trade school out in the valley. He installs cable now. Sends me a postcard at Christmas time. He's Dutch. Currently, we're in Santa Monica. You keep walking, you hit Venice - that's technically where we live. Past that, you got Marina Del Rey - lotta bike sh*ts in that area. And then you're getting near the beaches - Manhattan, Redondo, and basically that's it.",3
JESS,That's it. That's all of LA.,3
JIMMY,"Well, there are these crazy rumors that if you get in your car and you actually drive east away from the beach, there's some city and other stuff, but personally I don't believe it.",3
JESS,I take it you like the beach.,3
JIMMY,I would marry the beach if man and property were allowed to mate.,3
JESS,Sounds serious.,3
JIMMY,"I've lived a lot of places all over this country, and nothing, absolutely nothing, compares to this.",3
JESS,So where else have you lived?,3
JIMMY,"What, where else? Let's see. Minneapolis, Chicago, Biloxi, Maine - worked on a lobster boat.",3
JESS,Yeah?,3
JIMMY,"Yeah. Let me tell you, I smelled great. Did a stint in New Jersey, New Hampshire...",3
JESS,New York?,3
JIMMY,"Oh, yeah, well, obviously, New York. New York was. . .well, you know what New York was, so. . .",3
JESS,Jimmy?,3
JIMMY,Yeah?,3
JESS,"I didn't come here to bust your balls, man.",3
JIMMY,"Okay, good to know.",3
LEE,"Jimmy, I got the pickle guy. He's as worried about you as I am.",3
JIMMY,I should take this.,3
JESS,Go ahead. I can just hang out.,3
JIMMY,You sure?,3
JESS,"I got my book, I'm good.",3
JIMMY,,3
RORY,"Hi, I'm here to see my grandmother.",3
MAID,She's in the living room with Miss Celine.,3
RORY,With who?,3
MAID,,3
CELINE,It's stunning.,3
EMILY,,3
CELINE,"Chills, I've got chills. Turn for me, dear. Oh, it moves, it just moves. Ginger Rogers always insisted her dresses move just like that.",3
EMILY,,3
CELINE,"Of course, she didn't have your legs.",3
EMILY,"Oh, Celine.",3
RORY,"Hey, Grandma.",3
EMILY,"Rory, perfect. What do you think?",3
RORY,You look beautiful.,3
EMILY,"Well, if I do, it's all because of this lady here. Rory, I'd like you to meet Miss Celine. She's been our fashion consultant for years.",3
RORY,,3
CELINE,"Oh my God, it's Audrey Hepburn.",3
RORY,,3
CELINE,You're Audrey Hepburn in Sabrina. Just a waif with eyes.,3
RORY,"Uh, thank you.",3
RICHARD,,3
CELINE,"Richard, look at this girl, what do you see?",3
RICHARD,,3
CELINE,It's Audrey Hepburn in Sabrina.,3
RICHARD,"Hm, now that you mention it, there is a touch of Audrey in her.",3
EMILY,,3
CELINE,"Yes, without that ridiculous affected accent. For years I kept telling her, ""Audrey, get a speech therapist."" She was very stubborn. But could she wear capris.",3
EMILY,,3
CELINE,"Yale, that is exciting. You'll need a whole new wardrobe, huh?",3
EMILY,,3
CELINE,"Yes, I had that exact suit made in mint for Mrs. Walter Cronkite just last week. A darling woman. We've been friends since the Big Bang.",3
RORY,"Uh, that's nice.",3
EMILY,"What do you think of this, Richard?",3
RICHARD,"Well, I like the green one with the beads. It made you look like a mermaid.",3
RORY,,3
CELINE,There's going to be grass?,3
RORY,,3
CELINE,"Oh, you cannot wear green around grass. I learned that from Tova Borgnine the hard way. Go try the red one on. Red goes wonderful with nature.",3
EMILY,All right.,3
RICHARD,,3
CELINE,"Ah, yes, yes, with this white silk shirt.",3
RICHARD,,3
CELINE,"Yes, I had that exact shirt on Jimmy Stewart the night before his colonoscopy. He came through it clean as a whistle.",3
RICHARD,,3
CELINE,Never underestimate the power of a good shirt.,3
RORY,,3
MADELINE,Kathy Kim.,3
LOUISE,Check.,3
MADELINE,Next. Greg Agulara.,3
LOUISE,Check.,3
MADELINE,Next. Brad Langford.,3
LOUISE,Check.,3
BRAD,Why did you do that?,3
LOUISE,It has a really bad picture of us on it.,3
BRAD,"Yeah, but that page had the only picture of me in the entire book.",3
MADELINE,Oh. There. Next.,3
PARIS,No one is going to buy our tickets.,3
LORELAI,"Give it time, Paris.",3
PARIS,We've been sitting here for an hour and have sold eight tickets.,3
LORELAI,"Grad Night is a big deal, Paris. They will buy the tickets.",3
PARIS,Unbutton your top.,3
LORELAI,What?,3
PARIS,Teenage boys are controlled by one thing. Unbutton your top.,3
LORELAI,No.,3
PARIS,"Well, me doing it isn't going to help any.",3
LORELAI,"Paris, you need to relax. You need to stop worrying. You need to stop obsessing. You need to stop looking at my boobs.",3
PARIS,"Fine. Oh, man, even the stupid class poster table has a line.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, time to play ""Let's distract Paris."" Look at me. Let's talk.",3
PARIS,About what?,3
LORELAI,Anything. Tell me w hat college you finally landed on.,3
PARIS,I didn't.,3
LORELAI,"Well, what's it between?",3
PARIS,"Princeton, Columbia, and Yale.",3
LORELAI,Good choices.,3
PARIS,"I'm really not that interested in Columbia, but the thought of me going there horrifies my mother so I have to keep it in the mix, you know?",3
LORELAI,Do I ever.,3
PARIS,"Princeton's a good school, but Jamie goes there.",3
LORELAI,That's your boyfriend?,3
PARIS,"Yes. He goes there, and if I go there, it's going to look like I went there just to be with him. Suddenly I'm Fel icity without the hair issues and I'm not terribly comfortable with that.",3
LORELAI,But look at it like this - not going to a school you wanna go to just because your boyfriend is there is just as bad as going to a school you don't wanna go to just because your boyfriend isn't there.,3
PARIS,I guess.,3
LORELAI,"If you wanna go to Princeton, go to Princeton. If you wanna go to Yale, go to Yale. Leave Jamie o ut of it. Leave your mother out of it. Just decide whatever it is you wanna do and do it.",3
PARIS,"I can try that, I guess. Thanks.",3
LORELAI,You're welcome.,3
PARIS,"Uh, what are you doing?",3
LORELAI,I'm giving you a hug.,3
PARIS,Why?,3
LORELAI,,3
JIMMY,"Sash, I'm home!",3
JIMMY,"What's up, Lily-Lou? Want some pineapple on your pizza?",3
LILY,Yes.,3
JIMMY,Yes.,3
JESS,Does she do that a lot?,3
JIMMY,All the time.,3
JESS,You ever find it a little weird?,3
JIMMY,"All the time. Uh, listen, why don't you give me a minute here.",3
JESS,Okay.,3
JIMMY,"Make it two, two minutes. Three, and do a special knock before you come in, maybe a -",3
JESS,"I'll tell you what, I passed a bookstore back on the boardwalk, why don't I just go check it out for awhile?",3
JIMMY,Okay. But I thought the knock idea was kind of cool.,3
SASHA,"So, last week when you said you were going to Sacramento to check out a potential supplier, you actually went. . .",3
JIMMY,To Connecticut to see Jess.,3
SASHA,That was quite an elaborate story you made up.,3
JIMMY,"Well, I do have a gift.",3
SASHA,Of course I didn't believe you.,3
JIMMY,"Okay, it's not a big gift, but . . .",3
SASHA,Why didn't you tell me?,3
JIMMY,"I don't know. You're nodding your head. Why are you nodding your head? You're shrugging your shoulders. You're nodding your head and shrugging your shoulders. Why are you nodding your head and shrugging your shoulders? Will you stop nodding your head and shrugging your shoulders? Sasha, come on.",3
SASHA,I'm gonna pick up the pizza.,3
JIMMY,Just have it delivered.,3
SASHA,"The delivery guys are too stoned after six to find the house, it'll take forever.",3
JIMMY,"I didn't know how it was gonna go, okay? I didn't know if he was even gonna be there or if he was gonna wanna talk to me or slug me or -",3
SASHA,I get it.,3
JIMMY,Sash.,3
SASHA,"I'll see you later, roomie.",3
JIMMY,"Do not do that. We are not roomies. We are partners, we're soul mates.",3
SASHA,You just traveled cross-country to see your son for the first time since he was born and you didn't tell me. We are roomies.,3
JIMMY,I'm sorry.,3
SASHA,Get the extra mattress out of the closet.,3
JIMMY,What for?,3
SASHA,For Jess.,3
JIMMY,For Jess to do what?,3
SASHA,For Jess to sleep on.,3
JIMMY,Jess is sleeping here?,3
SASHA,Isn't he?,3
JIMMY,I don't know.,3
SASHA,"Jimmy, you didn't ask him if he's staying the night?",3
JIMMY,No.,3
SASHA,"Well, did you ask him how long he's here for?",3
JIMMY,No.,3
SASHA,Did you ask him anything?,3
JIMMY,Should I have?,3
SASHA,"Jimmy, he could be in trouble.",3
JIMMY,"What, he's in trouble? What kind of trouble?",3
SASHA,How would I know what kind of trouble?,3
JIMMY,"Well, you're the one that just said he was in trouble.",3
SASHA,"I said he could be in trouble. He could be running from the cops, or attempting to hop across America on one foot, or he really did come all the way from Connecticut just to have pizza with his father who he's not seen or heard from in seventeen years.",3
JIMMY,What are the odds it's the last one?,3
SASHA,,3
CELINE,"Now, Sabrina, college is a very important time in a young girl's life. You need to be properly attired.",3
RORY,,3
CELINE,"Trust me, a young girl is completely and solely judged by her appearance. All right, let's begin. I always start every wardrobe from the top. The hat. Remember Sabrina, it's the first thing that God sees when you walk outside in the morning.",3
EMILY,"Well, I'm exhausted. I feel as if I've tried on every dress in town.",3
RORY,So is it the blue?,3
EMILY,"Yes, I think it's the blue. I think it's quite suitable for my granddaughter's graduation.",3
LORELAI,"Hey. Hi hon, hi Mom.",3
RORY,Hey.,3
EMILY,What are you doing here?,3
LORELAI,,3
CELINE,"Oh my God, it's Natalie Wood! Look Sabrina, it's Natalie Wood.",3
LORELAI,,3
CELINE,"Oh, I tried to retire once. Olivia deHavilland wouldn't hear of it.",3
LORELAI,,3
CELINE,"Lovely. Thank you for asking, Natalie.",3
EMILY,,3
CELINE,"No, no, I'll get them. It's who I am, the keeper of the clothes. Delight to see you again.",3
LORELAI,"Same here, Celine.",3
LORELAI,"Oh my God, she was like a thousand when I was ten, I can't believe it.",3
RORY,You should've seen all the clothes that Grandma tried on today.,3
LORELAI,Yeah?,3
RORY,She picked out a beautiful blue dress for graduation.,3
LORELAI,"Aw, I'd like to see that, Mom.",3
EMILY,It needs to be altered.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, sure. I'll see it at graduation, I guess. So I'm sorry I didn't give you advanced notice that I was coming over.",3
EMILY,"I don't need advanced notice, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, you just seem tense.",3
EMILY,"No, I'm just tired. And busy. I have a very busy evening ahead of me.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, I'm sure you do.",3
MAID,"Dinner's ready, Mrs. Gilmore.",3
EMILY,"No, it's not.",3
MAID,I just checked it and it's -,3
EMILY,I was in there ten minutes ago and it still had another forty minutes to go.,3
MAID,But it's really brown and -,3
EMILY,"Lupe, please do not argue with me. It's not ready. Now go in there and make the salad. What?",3
MAID,The salad's ready.,3
EMILY,Lupe!,3
LORELAI,"Mom, it's seven o'clock.",3
EMILY,So?,3
LORELAI,That's your dinnertime.,3
EMILY,"I don't have a dinnertime, Lorelai.",3
LORELAI,You don't have a dinnertime?,3
EMILY,"No, I don't.",3
LORELAI,"So all the years I grew up in this house, we did not sit down to dinner at exactly seven o'clock every single night?",3
EMILY,No.,3
LORELAI,I just imagined that?,3
EMILY,"Lorelai, I don't know what your obsession with dinnertime is.",3
LORELAI,"My obsession with dinnertime is that it was always at seven o'clock, now all of a sudden, it's not. Is it because I'm here?",3
EMILY,That's ridiculous.,3
LORELAI,"It is. I'm here, and if you served dinner, Miss Manners would insist that you invite me to stay and you don't want to, so you're going to pretend that dinner is suddenly whenever you feel like it.",3
EMILY,"Lorelai, do not get dramatic. Dinner is not ready, and even if it was, I would still not be able to invite you to stay because your father and I have plans tonight. We are eating quickly and then leaving.",3
LORELAI,To go where?,3
EMILY,The Thompsons.,3
LORELAI,For what?,3
EMILY,Book club.,3
LORELAI,What book?,3
EMILY,Lovely Bones.,3
LORELAI,Did you like it?,3
EMILY,It's not my taste but I respect the attempt.,3
LORELAI,Now I know where I get it from.,3
EMILY,"We'll have dinner another time, all right?",3
LORELAI,"Uh, so, are you kicking us out?",3
EMILY,"I told you, we have plans.",3
LORELAI,Or do you just wanna get that dinner of yours that's been ready for ten minutes now on the table?,3
EMILY,"Lorelai, please.",3
LORELAI,"Tell me this - if I couldn't stay but Rory could, would you want her to?",3
EMILY,"Of course I would, but as I told you, your father and I have plans.",3
LORELAI,So she can't stay even if I'm gone?,3
EMILY,"No, she can't.",3
RICHARD,"Emily, for heaven's sake, it's 7:10. Why aren't we eating?",3
LORELAI,"Oh, hi, Dad. Listen, um, Rory was gonna stay for dinner if you guys don't have plans.",3
RICHARD,"Of course we don't have any plans. Oh, I'm thrilled, Rory is staying. You just livened up a very boring night in the Gilmore house.",3
LORELAI,"Enjoy your dinner. And Mom, get yourself an agent 'cause you're wasting that talent of yours in dinner theater.",3
RORY,"Mom, wait.",3
RORY,"Mom, wait. Where are you going?",3
LORELAI,I'm gonna drive in a circle backwards really fast to reverse the Earth's orbit to go back in time to before I made the insane decision to come here in the first place.,3
RORY,You came here to pick me up.,3
LORELAI,What was I thinking doing that?,3
RORY,"You were thinking, 'Hey, wouldn't it be great for my daughter not to have to walk all the way back to Stars Hollow.'",3
LORELAI,"Well, a thirty-mile hike never hurt anyone. God, I can't believe her.",3
RORY,And I can't believe you.,3
LORELAI,Why?,3
RORY,You were gonna leave me here?,3
LORELAI,So you could have dinner with them.,3
RORY,"I never said I wanted to have dinner with them. You said I wanted to have dinner with them, and then you stormed out.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, I'm sorry. I just, I finally realized that I can't do this anymore. I can't come back here anymore, I'm done.",3
RORY,"Well, I'm sorry. I never should've asked you to pick me up.",3
LORELAI,"It's okay. It's good, actually. Now I can stop feeling guilty for not talking to them. I can go back to the way things were before. We share a nose and that's it.",3
RORY,So we're going?,3
LORELAI,"Yes, we're going.",3
RORY,"Okay, I have to go get my books. Please be here when I come back.",3
EMILY,Are you staying?,3
RORY,"No, I have to go, Grandma.",3
EMILY,"All right, I guess we'll just see you at graduation then.",3
RORY,I guess you will.,3
EMILY,"I swear, I don't know what to do with that mother of yours, I really don't. Everything has to be such a scene.",3
RORY,,3
LORELAI,"So, Souplantation. . .",3
RORY,"Hang on, I'm almost at the end of this chapter. Okay, let the raving begin.",3
LORELAI,"A room full of all you can eat food. Soup, salad, pizza, pasta, chicken wings, ice cream, rainbow sprinkles. How did I not know about the rainbow sprinkles?",3
RORY,I have no good answers for you.,3
LORELAI,We are going back with Tupperware.,3
RORY,It's turning yellow.,3
LORELAI,"Ah, sh**t.",3
RORY,"Come on, g*n it.",3
LORELAI,I can't.,3
RORY,"Mom, we have to get home.",3
LORELAI,"Rory, I already have two tickets. I cannot get another.",3
RORY,"Oh, I can't believe you stopped.",3
LORELAI,I can't believe you wanted me to go.,3
RORY,There's no one around.,3
LORELAI,"Now no one's around, but the second I run that light, a police car, four helicopters, the Canadian mounties and the crew of Cops jump out of a dumpster and I'm toast.",3
RORY,Paranoid.,3
LORELAI,"Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you, my friend.",3
RORY,"All right, I guess we wait.",3
RORY,Do you think Luke will know we went to Souplantation?,3
LORELAI,Not unless you tell him.,3
RORY,But maybe he'll be able to tell. They'll be a glow.,3
LORELAI,An all-you-can-eat glow.,3
RORY,"He'll see the glow, he'll know we cheated, and he'll never give us extra fries again.",3
RORY,"Um, Mom, why did just bolt away from us?",3
LORELAI,Maybe he saw the glow.,3
RORY,Mom.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, first of all, I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner. I just thought with all the stuff you were doing, maybe I should wait.",3
RORY,What's going on?,3
LORELAI,Jess is gone.,3
RORY,Gone where?,3
LORELAI,"I don't know. Luke knows, but he didn't tell me. But he doesn't seem to think he's comingback.",3
RORY,Neither do I.,3
LORELAI,Are you okay?,3
RORY,Yeah.,3
LORELAI,,3
JIMMY,"Hey, when you say 'I'm going to check out a bookstore on the boardwalk', you be more specific.",3
JESS,What?,3
JIMMY,"I have been wandering around for over an hour. I've been to three different bookstores. I have been worried sick about you, you hear me?",3
JESS,Sorry.,3
JIMMY,Outside.,3
JESS,But -,3
JIMMY,Outside.,3
JIMMY,Are you in trouble?,3
JESS,What?,3
JIMMY,"You know, when you left home, were the cops after you?",3
JESS,No.,3
JIMMY,No 'cause they shouldn't be or no 'cause they haven't found the head yet?,3
JESS,"What's up, Jimmy?",3
JIMMY,"You just showed up here, man.",3
JESS,I know I did.,3
JIMMY,"No call, no letter, just like -",3
JESS,"Just like you showed up in Stars Hollow with no letter, no call.",3
JIMMY,Hey.,3
JESS,Were you in trouble?,3
JIMMY,"We're not talking about me, we're talking about you.",3
JESS,I'm not running from the cops.,3
JIMMY,Then why are you here?,3
JESS,Why'd you come to Stars Hollow?,3
JIMMY,"Hey, listen, Mr. Double-Talk, I need an answer here.",3
JESS,"Well, so do I. You show up, you don't talk to me, you don't say anything. You just have a cup of coffee, then you left. Why'd you come if you didn't even wanna talk to me?",3
JIMMY,I did wanna talk to you.,3
JESS,You did?,3
JIMMY,"Of course I wanted to talk to you. You think a person travels all the way across the country just to listen to a Bowie song? Granted, a classic off Ziggy, but still.",3
JESS,"So, what, you're telling me you just chickened out?",3
JIMMY,Yeah.,3
JESS,"Oh. Well, I came to see you.",3
JIMMY,Okay.,3
JESS,And I thought maybe I could crash here for a little while.,3
JIMMY,Uh huh.,3
JESS,Just a little while. I don't need my own room or anything. I can just sleep on the couch.,3
JIMMY,Or the extra mattress we keep in the closet.,3
JESS,"Sure, that'd be fine, too.",3
JIMMY,"You know, Sasha's always right. It drives me crazy. No matter what the situation, she's always right.",3
JESS,Jimmy.,3
JIMMY,"I'd love to be right just once in awhile, you know?",3
JESS,It wouldn't be for long.,3
JIMMY,"Do you know she called the Super Bowl five times in a row? Who does that? What is she, a witch?",3
JESS,"You know what, say no if you want.",3
JIMMY,"Jess, man, come on, you can't stay here.",3
JESS,Why not?,3
JIMMY,'Cause you can't.,3
JESS,Why not?,3
JIMMY,'Cause you can't.,3
JESS,Why not?,3
JIMMY,Because you can't.,3
JESS,"Well, I'd ask ""why not"" but it doesn't seem to be getting me anywhere.",3
JIMMY,"Look at me, Jess. I'm not a father. I was never a father. I left you because I wasn't a father. I mean it, the minute the cigar was finished, I was like, ""What the hell are you doing? You can't take care of yourself. How are you gonna take care of someone else?""",3
JESS,That's not why -,3
JIMMY,"I can't take you in, I can't raise you.",3
JESS,"Raise me? I'm eig hteen! I'm raised. I can vote, I can be drafted. It's a little late to throw me a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle birthday party.",3
JIMMY,I thought you didn't come here to bust my balls.,3
JESS,I didn't.,3
JIMMY,"Well, then put the bat down, man.",3
JESS,I don't need a daddy. I just need a place to crash.,3
JIMMY,Do you even understand that it's only been the last five years that I've even started to put my life together? You don't wanna be around me. I am a screw-up. That is my genetic code.,3
JESS,"Well, the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree.",3
JIMMY,"Don't say that. You're young, you can do anything you want.",3
JESS,A month. Just let me stay a month.,3
JIMMY,Are you listening? I have nothing to offer you. Nothing.,3
JESS,"You have nothing? I have nothing! I have no place to go. I can't stay at Luke's, I can't stay in Stars Hollow. My mother is a wackjob. I mean, you're saying you're this loser and what, you don't wanna take me off this terrific path I'm headed down right now? I'm not graduating high school. I don't know what I'm gonna do with the rest of my life, but something's telling me I better find out soon or I'm gonna be that guy out there on the boardwalk selling the hemp hats.",3
JIMMY,I have one of those. It's a good hat.,3
JESS,Well?,3
JIMMY,I have to talk it over with Sasha.,3
JESS,Just tell her I'm a dog.,3
JIMMY,"Great idea. Maybe you can sit there and lick yourself while she decides, you know, help sell it.",3
JESS,"Thank you, Jimmy.",3
JIMMY,"If she says it's okay, then we'll see.",3
JESS,"Fine, we'll see.",3
JIMMY,It may not work out.,3
JESS,I totally understand.,3
JIMMY,,3
RORY,"Oh my God, I'm so tired.",3
LORELAI,"Here's a crazy thought, how about going to bed?",3
RORY,I have to study.,3
LORELAI,"Or, better yet, make a pot of coffee and once again, get no sleep. Just as good.",3
RORY,What's this?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, that's just. . .Yale needed my Social Security number for something.",3
RORY,Oh.,3
LORELAI,Look who became a s oche.,3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,"You have a lot of signatures in here, little girl.",3
RORY,Everybody signs everybody's yearbook. It's polite.,3
LORELAI,"""Rory, have a great summer. BFF. Amber."" Hey, Amber BFF'ed you.",3
RORY,"Yeah, I feel truly blessed.",3
LORELAI,"""Hey, Aurory Borealis."" Okay, can't talk to this one ever again. ""You have been my inspiration, my rock, my light. I loved you in South Pacific."" When did you do South Pacific?",3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,,3
RORY,"Oh, Shauna tends to get people mixed up.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, okay.",3
LORELAI,"Hey, you know what's weird? A lot of the kids in here are calling you a valedictorian. Is that anything like a dirty skank, 'cause if it is I'll kick their plaid butts up and down the sidewalk. Were you named valedictorian?",3
RORY,"Yes, and you know what that means? One more stupid speech that I have to write, that I have no time to write, but nevertheless, I have to write.",3
LORELAI,"Hey, listen, my little Holly Hunter in Broadcast News, I'm gonna let you freak out and study like a mad woman and stress yourself out until finals, but once they're over, we are gonna celebrate big time. . .'cause this is amazing.",3

LORELAI,We are so not walking around Europe with those annoying things on our backs.,3
RORY,But we're backpacking through Europe. How're we gonna do this without backpacks?,3
LORELAI,"But all the time w e've talked about backpacking, I never actually pictured us with backpacks.",3
RORY,"Well, what were you picturing?",3
LORELAI,"Spry, accommodating European men with neat mustaches trailing after us, carrying our luggage, hailing taxi cabs, constantly reminding us how beautiful we are.",3
RORY,"No, it's just the two of us humping our backpacks around.",3
LORELAI,"Well, at least my new walking shoes are all broken in. If you count broken skin, broken toes.",3
LUKE,Don't do that.,3
Posted,06/01/03 01:49,3

LUKE,Don't take your shoes off. This is a restaurant.,3

LUKE,"It's right here, don't do that.",3
RORY,"We're in pain, Luke.",3
LUKE,But it's great that you guys are bearing it so nobly. And can you move these?,3
RORY,Can? No.,3
LORELAI,Would if we could? Debatable.,3
LORELAI,Look at that.,3
RORY,Spry and accommodating.,3
LORELAI,"Hey, would you grow a mustache and follow us around Europe?",3

LUKE,And do my ventriloquist act?,3
LORELAI,And propose.,3
LUKE,I have no plans to propose.,3
LORELAI,"You don't now, but after you've had dinner at Captain Stubing's table and Isaac's served you up a couple of mojitos.",3

SOOKIE,Terrible. So what's the story?,3
LUKE,Is there a spider on me?,3

LUKE,It's not so bad.,3

LORELAI,Is shot?,3
SOOKIE,It's caving in.,3

SOOKIE,Along with our hopes and dreams.,3

LORELAI,"Great, Kirk. You find any mold?",3
KIRK,"You mean, did I find any silent death? Not so far, no.",3
LORELAI,Good.,3
KIRK,"I did tell you about the dangers of mold, right? And Ed McMahon's dog?",3

KIRK,Suffered memo ry loss due to mold infestation. Forgot how to sit.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, it was horrible.",3

KIRK,Thanks.,3
LORELAI,"So, what's the final prognosis, Luke? We're not buying a money pit, are we?",3
LUKE,"You're gonna spend money, but it's not a pit. Might be a steal.",3
LORELAI,It's a steal!,3
SOOKIE,We are such great businesswomen.,3
LUKE,"Once you start work, you can probably have this place up and running in four or five months.",3

STUDENT,"We all knew that our education at Chilton would be exemplary, but it was the people at Chilton. All my friends - Hi Marcy, love you. Cody and Debbie, love you, too.

PARIS,"Relax, I'm okay with you making valedictorian over me.",3
RORY,"Oh, good, thanks.",3
PARIS,"Sure. I actually googled the personal histories of Ivy League valedictorians going back twenty-five years, and found some en lightening statistics. They don't necessarily do too well in later life, did you know that?",3
RORY,No.,3

MICHELorelai,I hate this.,3
SOOKIE,"One guest. In the whole inn, one guy.",3
MICHELorelai,And I pulled towel duty today. It's especially awful handling guest towels when you know exactly which guests the towels belong to. It's his mites on those towels.,3
SOOKIE,Don't be gross.,3
MICHELorelai,This is degrading for a man of my capabilities.,3
SOOKIE,"Well, what about me? I've got no kitchen. I'm a chef. My skills are deteriorating. I need to sauté, emulsify, marinate.",3
MICHELorelai,I need more mental stimulation.,3
SOOKIE,I need to frickin' fry a dead animal in a skillet. I'm going nuts.,3

SOOKIE,Not as sick as I am of you.,3

SOOKIE,I'm not doing his stupid towels. I hate that stupid guy with his stupid newspaper. He's stupid.,3

SOOKIE,Tell it to Deney Terrio here. I should've been a dancer.,3
MICHELorelai,"Lorelai, how long can we keep this up?",3
LORELAI,Keep what up?,3
MICHELorelai,"We have one guest, half the rooms are still closed from the fire, most of the staff is laid off, I am doing mite towels, and the owner's son is walking around with a bunch of men in suits.",3
SOOKIE,"Yeah, John's here. That can't be good.",3
LORELAI,John is here looking things over for the renovation that will reopen all the closed rooms so we can be up and running again. Stop worrying.,3

LORELAI,"Well, hm, hm, hm.",3
EMILY,Lorelai.,3
LORELAI,Sorry. Hmm.,3
EMILY,Lorelai.,3
LORELAI,"Mom, of course we'll be sitting together. We're family.",3
EMILY,"Well, I knew that. I just wasn't sure if you did.",3
LORELAI,"Well, we're sitting together.",3
EMILY,Good.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, it is.",3
RICHARD,"Ask her about the gift, Emily.",3
LORELAI,Dad?,3
EMILY,He's on the other line.,3
LORELAI,"Oh, sure got the quiet thing down there.",3
RICHARD,"I'm on the upstairs portable, but I'm on my way downstairs. I see your mother now. Hello Emily.",3
EMILY,Hello Richard.,3
RICHARD,I'm on my way to the couch and am about to sit.,3
LORELAI,It's like the thrilling day of radio here.,3
EMILY,We wanted to ask you about a gift for Rory.,3
RICHARD,"It's a big gift, a little extravagant.",3
EMILY,"But it's a big occasion, so it makes sense.",3
RICHARD,We wanna buy her a car.,3
LORELAI,"Well, I think that's a great idea.",3
EMILY,Really?,3
RICHARD,Wonderful.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, Rory needs to get back and forth from Yale a lot, and the quicker she can do it, the more I get to see her, so it's really kind of a present for me, too.",3
RICHARD,"Yes, right.",3
EMILY,I suppose so.,3
RICHARD,Didn't think of that.,3
LORELAI,Just not a gas guzzler. And no Ferrari's or Lamborghini's.,3
RICHARD,So nothing Italian?,3
LORELAI,"No, it can be Italian, just sensible Italian.",3
RICHARD,"All right, well, good.",3
EMILY,I'm glad we had this settled.,3
LORELAI,"Good. Well, maybe I'll see you at the graduation, maybe I won't.",3
EMILY,What?,3
LORELAI,See you there. Bye.,3
RICHARD,Goodbye.,3
EMILY,Bye.,3
LORELAI,"Hey, you and your Armani posse want something to drink, John?",3
JOHN,"No, no, Lorelai. We're fine, thanks.",3
LORELAI,"Okay. So, I've been lying to people about you all day.",3
JOHN,About what?,3
LORELAI,"Oh, about how it's not a big deal that you're walking around with a concerned look on your face with a group of men with concerned looks on their faces. I think I've been lying to me a little, too.",3
JOHN,We have to close off three more rooms.,3
LORELAI,Three rooms? That'll leave us with two.,3
JOHN,"And, uh, the estimate for the repairs to get everything back to the quality we had and up to code. . .it's not pretty.",3
LORELAI,"No, that's not pretty.",3
JOHN,Mom's leaning toward selling.,3
LORELAI,Selling.,3
JOHN,Nothing's final yet.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, nothing's final. I just. . .Rory grew up here. I grew up here.",3
JOHN,"Yeah, I better get back to my group.",3
LORELAI,"Right, sure, you go. Hey, be careful not to trip over our guest.",3
JOHN,,3
LORELAI,"Sookie, Jackson, you better not be in bed.",3
JACKSON,Are you expecting Lorelai?,3
SOOKIE,No.,3
LORELAI,Come on. The night is young and the champagne's cold.,3
SOOKIE,The champagne?,3
LORELAI,Surprise!,3
SOOKIE,What is this?,3
LORELAI,It's a celebration.,3
SOOKIE,For what?,3
LORELAI,"Sookie, get some glasses, and Jackson, put some music on. Whatever you want, just make it festive.",3
JACKSON,Got it.,3
SOOKIE,"I don't know what this is, but it's fun.",3
JACKSON,Let's see. I've got Creedence Clearwater Revival.,3
LORELAI,"Good energy, too hillbilly.",3
JACKSON,Okay.,3
LORELAI,"How you coming with those glasses, Sook?",3
SOOKIE,Just wiping off the fancy ones.,3
JACKSON,Huey Lewis and the News? It's Sookie's.,3
SOOKIE,"Hey, we all have our guilty pleasures.",3
JACKSON,Herb Albert and the Tijuana Brass?,3
LORELAI,"Ah, fun, festive, that's perfect! Crank it. Okay, I've got some cold Dom for me and Jackson.",3
JACKSON,Happens to be my brand.,3
SOOKIE,"Oh, I love this song.",3
LORELAI,"And, uh, for Sookie and little baby, uh, whatever-it-is, we've got the, uh, apple bubbly stuff. And cheers. JACKSON/",3
SOOKIE,Cheers!,3
SOOKIE,"Well, come on, what are we celebrating?",3
LORELAI,"Well, you ready?",3
SOOKIE,Yeah.,3
JACKSON,Definitely!,3
LORELAI,The Independence Inn is closing.,3
JACKSON,Yay!,3
SOOKIE,Yay! The inn is closing.,3
LORELAI,"Not closing, closed. We're finished. It's all over. They're boarding the place up as we speak. Who wants more?",3
JACKSON,"Well, did they find some gold in the basement or something 'cause I'm missing the celebrating angle.",3
LORELAI,"You should always celebrate new challenges, and that's what this is.",3
SOOKIE,A new challenge.,3
LORELAI,"Yes. They'll be some severance pay, then nothing.",3
SOOKIE,Nothing!,3
LORELAI,Nothing but exciting new challenges. Cheers!,3
SOOKIE,The inn is closed.,3
JACKSON,"Well, I guess this means that you guys can focus solely on refurbishing the Dragonfly, getting that up and running. That's exciting.",3
SOOKIE,"Yes, it is.",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, I agree. But just drink some more. How're you feeling?",3
SOOKIE,"A little drunk, and all I'm drinking is apple juice.",3
LORELAI,"Well, good, 'cause I've got another little piece of news for you. We can't buy the Dragonfly because I can't swing my share of the money because I no longer have a steady income.",3
JACKSON,"Wow, that is great.",3
SOOKIE,"I'm sorry, was that an exciting challenge too?",3
LORELAI,"Absolutely. Yesterday our lives were boring and predictable. We had jobs, we were gonna start our own business. But now everything is wide open. We can do anything we want because we're not penned in. That's good.",3
SOOKIE,"Yes, that's good. And thinking of those new challenges is a nice way to distract me from the fact that we don't work together anymore so we're gonna see way less of each other.",3
LORELAI,Which will make our limited time together more enjoyable.,3
JACKSON,"Right. And since I'm your vegetable supplier, I'm losing work, and seeing my wife and close friend way less than before.",3
LORELAI,,3
TAYLORory,"That would convert it into a town bylaw, a minor but nonetheless important change from local ordinance, giving us the leeway to enforce charter amendments five and six and grandfathering in previously proposed statutes with no procedural delay. So all those in favor of going ahead of this, say aye.",3
TAYLORory,All those opposed?,3
TAYLORory,,3
PATTY,"Oh, sorry, Taylor.",3
TAYLORory,What is the matter with you?,3
LUKE,I think it might be the first time sixty people lost their train of thought all at the same time.,3
BABETTE,"Yeah, Taylor, your voice always makes me think of my grocery list. We need croutons.",3
MOREY,Got it.,3
TAYLORory,"Moving on. Now, people, I know it's an unpleasant subject, but the deer population in this town is reaching monstrous proportions.",3
GYPSY,,3
PATTY,He's always going on about the deer.,3
LUKE,"Leave 'em alone, Taylor.",3
TAYLORory,But they're taking over the town. We need to institute partial elimination.,3
MOREY,Partial elimination?,3
GYPSY,You wanna k*ll the little romping Bambi's?,3
TAYLORory,"People, do I have to detail the problems that these deer cause?",3
LUKE,"No, but you will.",3
TAYLORory,"Lyme disease, auto accidents, plane accidents.",3
LUKE,,3
PATTY,"Oh, that's scary.",3
BABETTE,Yeah. Those ones you can snuff.,3
TAYLORory,"But the worst problem is the crop loss. Dean, hand me the blow-up please.",3
GYPSY,"Hey, Dean, he's paying you for all this, right?",3
DEAN,Yeah.,3
KIRK,"Really, how much?",3
TAYLORory,"People, this is a randomly chosen but typical landscaped area in the town that was denuded by these ruminant pests.",3
GYPSY,Randomly chosen?,3
LUKE,,3
PATTY,This is a little self-serving.,3
TAYLORory,It might be my yard. Uh. . .,3
BABETTE,"Might be? Taylor, no one else has a ""Kiss the Gardener"" sign.",3
MOREY,This is a trumped up problem.,3
TAYLORory,So none of you are interested in addressing this scourge?,3
KIRK,I have a thought.,3
TAYLORory,"Go ahead, Kirk.",3
KIRK,A controlled hunt.,3
BABETTE,g*ns?,3
KIRK,"Not g*ns, wolves.",3
LUKE,What?,3
KIRK,,3
PATTY,I say that we defer this unsavory topic for another year.,3
TAYLORory,,3
PATTY,All those in favor?,3
EVERYONE,,3
PATTY,Taylor's opposed. Meeting adjourned.,3
RORY,I missed the whole thing?,3
LANE,"Yes, and I'm still semi-grounded, so I only have a limited amount of time in the outside world.",3
RORY,"Well, hurry and show me your prom pictures.",3
LANE,These are them.,3
RORY,"Lane, how many did you take?",3
LANE,"Three hundred. I'll leave them with you, they're pretty self explanatory.",3
RORY,What's this?,3
LANE,Our chicken piccata.,3
RORY,"Ah, and this?",3
LANE,Our chicken piccata after one bite.,3
RORY,"So, don't tell me, two bites?",3
LANE,Yup.,3
RORY,"Okay, I think I can follow this.",3
LANE,Gotta run. Keep 'em in order.,3
RORY,I will.,3
RORY,Hi.,3
DEAN,Hi.,3
RORY,"Taylor's paying you to do all this work, isn't he?",3
DEAN,"He knows I need money, so he's helping me out with extra stuff to do. He's a good guy.",3
RORY,"Yeah, he is a good guy. A very good guy. So how are the old wedding plans?",3
DEAN,They're fine.,3
RORY,"You know, my mom's held about a million weddings at the inn and I've worked on a lot of them, so I'm a fountain of useful tips.",3
DEAN,Good.,3
RORY,"For instance, your photographer, have him take candid photographs along with the other ones, so that way you'll capture a lot of your favorite moments and you won't be stuck with just the stiff, you know, posed sh*ts.",3
DEAN,"Candid, okay.",3
RORY,And if the ring bearer is younger than five years-old.,3
DEAN,"My nephew, he's three.",3
RORY,"Don't give him the ring until the last second because I have seen many a ring swallowed, and well, it takes a couple days to get it back.",3
DEAN,"Good point. It's actually been kind of overwhelming. I mean, you have to rent the hall like a year in advance.",3
RORY,And make sure that your deposit is refundable as long as you can.,3
DEAN,"Yeah, it is. And then there's a lot of stuff that we have to buy, too, for our place.",3
RORY,"Oh yeah, about that. Come on, sit.",3
DEAN,What's this?,3
RORY,Your wedding gift.,3
DEAN,What?,3
RORY,"You can get anything you want, but I've marked a bunch of pages with stuff that I think would be most appropriate, and I just wanted to get in early so I'd be the first one to get you a blender, not the third one.",3
DEAN,You don't have to do this.,3
RORY,I know. That's why it's fun.,3
DEAN,This has everything.,3
RORY,"I'd recommen d the mixing bowls, those are really nice. Or a knife set and a sharpener. Sharpening's very important. I learned that from Sookie. If you leave 'em too long, it's too late. Respect your knives.",3
DEAN,"Thanks, Rory.",3
RORY,You're welcome. So just look through it with Lindsay and pick out what you want and I'll order it.,3
DEAN,I will.,3
RORY,"Bye, Dean.",3
DEAN,,3
SOOKIE,Maybe we should bring it in a bit more.,3
RORY,"Oh sure, but first we'll have to use a medieval t*rture instrument to crush my ribs and flatten my spinal cord in order to accommodate your sadistic wish there.",3
LORELAI,Don't use subtlety on us. We're slow.,3
SOOKIE,I think she's saying that we don't need to bring it in anymore.,3
LORELAI,"Take it off, you're done.",3
SOOKIE,"Ugh, I should go. I've got a stupid job interview tomorrow morning, and you know what, I'm nervous.",3
LORELAI,Which place?,3
SOOKIE,Harrington's in Woodbridge.,3
LORELAI,Nice.,3
SOOKIE,"They want me to be their executive chef four nights a week. God, I can't imagine working someplace else. And without my Lorelai!",3
RORY,"But it's only a few months until the Dragonfly opens, right?",3
SOOKIE,Uh. . .you haven't told her yet.,3
RORY,Told me w hat?,3
LORELAI,I was waiting for an opportunity.,3
RORY,To tell me w hat?,3
LORELAI,"Which apparently is right now. Okay, um, hon, listen. We, um. . .we're not buying the Dragonfly.",3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,It's just not the right time.,3
RORY,You're crazy. It's the perfect time.,3
LORELAI,Not really.,3
RORY,"But if you wait, someone else is gonna buy it. You said so yourself.",3
SOOKIE,"I'm gonna go, guys. Sorry to spill the beans.",3
LORELAI,That's okay. I'll see you later.,3
RORY,"Mom, why put it off? I mean, I know the Independence Inn closing is a setback.",3
LORELAI,Big one.,3
RORY,"But we've got the rest of Grandpa's money, that's plenty to buy the Dragonfly Inn, and we'll just scrimp on everything until it's all up and running and successful.",3
LORELAI,It would take a lot of scrimping.,3
RORY,"Well, I'm a master scrimper. I would make the Olympic scrimping team. I'm that good, boy.",3
LORELAI,"Honey, we didn't get financial aid for Yale.",3
RORY,What?,3
LORELAI,"No scholarships, no hardship money, no money-off coupons, no gift certificates, nothing.",3
RORY,"I don't understand, what happened?",3
LORELAI,"Well, irony of ironies, the money I got from your grandpa took us out of the running for financial aid 'cause it made it look like we have money.",3
RORY,"Well, send them proof - a bank statement, a letter from Grandpa. Here, take a picture of this couch - no one will think we have money after looking at this couch.",3
LORELAI,"I tried everything, I swear.",3
RORY,Why didn't you tell me this?,3
LORELAI,"With everything that's going on, finals and all your personal stuff, I didn't want you worrying.",3
RORY,But Grandpa's money -,3
LORELAI,Is paying for Yale.,3
RORY,No! No way!,3
LORELAI,Rory.,3
RORY,I'll take a student loan out from the bank. That's what banks are for.,3
LORELAI,"Honey, I don't want you to be buried by loans the day you graduate from college.",3
RORY,"Well, then I'll major in something that'll immediately make me a lot of money when Igraduate. I'll major in business or engineering.",3
LORELAI,You are not changing your major from journalism because of my lack of money.,3
RORY,It's our lack.,3
LORELAI,"Look, if you need to work as a low-paid intern for a magazine or a stringer for some small-town newspaper or Tom Brokaw's toupee comber-outer before you make real money, then that's what you'll do.",3
RORY,There has to be another way.,3
LORELAI,I've looked. There's nothing.,3
RORY,This is so not fair to you.,3
LORELAI,"I'll have my own inn one day, I promise. But Yale comes first.",3
LORELAI,What are you gonna do now?,3
RORY,Rail at God for awhile.,3
LORELAI,,3
LORELAI,"Hey, what happened to our packing elves who were gonna pack our packs over night?",3
RORY,How about this?,3
LORELAI,You hate the dress I made you that much?,3
RORY,"Not for graduation, for Europe.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, it's perfect. It's black so it won't show dirt or wrinkles, and if you wear it with a moody look on your face like you're thinking of Bolsheviks, they'll mistake you for Simone de Beauvoir. Pack it.",3
RORY,It's too heavy.,3
LORELAI,"So, was that a trick question?",3
RORY,We both need to cut weight from our packs.,3
LORELAI,I am doing my part here.,3
RORY,"Well, you don't need five pairs of boots.",3
LORELAI,I'll drop some boots if you drop some books.,3
RORY,I can't drop books.,3
LORELAI,You can't bring twelve books.,3
RORY,"You also need to cut your undergarments. Don't forget, we'll rinse in Woolite every few days.",3
LORELAI,This is going to an uncomfortable place.,3
RORY,And your toothpaste - you have three full tubes.,3
LORELAI,So?,3
RORY,Why three?,3
LORELAI,"If I lose one, I'll have another to take its place.",3
RORY,"If you're bringing three tubes of toothpaste, I am bringing twelve books plus a dictionary.",3
LORELAI,Then I'm bringing a gallon of mercury which is one of the densest and heaviest substances known to man.,3
RORY,I think the writing's on the wall here.,3
LORELAI,Cancel Europe.,3
RORY,I've gotta run. I love my graduation dress.,3
LORELAI,I know.,3
RORY,"Hey, it's a shame ab out Europe being canceled, huh?",3
LORELAI,"That's okay. It's not supposed to be that great anyway, except for the cheese.",3
RORY,Nine books for two toothpastes.,3
LORELAI,,3
RICHARD,"Who is it, Emily?",3
EMILY,"I don't know, Richard. My x-ray vision isn't working at the moment.",3
RICHARD,I was wondering if you were expecting somebody.,3
EMILY,I wasn't expecting anybody.,3
EMILY,Rory.,3
RORY,"Hey Grandma, hey Grandpa.",3
RICHARD,What brings you here on this busy day?,3
RORY,I have sort of a time-sensitive issue I need to talk to you about.,3
RICHARD,"Time sensitive. Well, come in , come in.",3
EMILY,We were just getting ready for your ceremony.,3
RICHARD,"And I was just retying my tie for the third time. No matter how many times I tie a tie, there's always room for error.",3
RORY,"It's not an exact science, is it?",3
RICHARD,Nor an art form. It's pretty much nothing.,3
RORY,"Sit down, please.",3
RICHARD,Okay.,3
EMILY,All right. Should we be nervous?,3
RORY,"No, you shouldn't be. I am a little.",3
RICHARD,"Well, what is it?",3
RORY,I need money.,3
RICHARD,You need money.,3
RORY,For Yale.,3
RICHARD,You need money for Yale.,3
EMILY,Stop repeating everything she says.,3
RICHARD,"I'm sorry, I'm processing.",3
RORY,"Look, it's a long story, but no other financing came through and all of the other options that Mom and I have are just. . .well, not good enough. So here's the offer - I would like for you to loan me the money for four years at Yale, and in return I will get a part time job and pay you in installments. I will continue this payment schedule after graduation increasing the payment amounts in proportion to my income. Plus, I will reinstate Friday night dinners with me. Every Friday night, I will be here, seven o'clock on the dot.",3
EMILY,"Well, how wonderful.",3
RICHARD,"We've missed you, Rory.",3
RORY,"I've missed you, too. So this should work out for everyone, right?",3
EMILY,Absolutely. We're happy to do it.,3
RICHARD,Not so fast.,3
EMILY,Richard.,3
RICHARD,"Oh, I'm happy to pay for Yale, but I don't want it to be a loan.",3
RORY,"No, I don't want that. I want it to be a loan, because otherwise it's too easy.",3
RICHARD,"Well, then here's my counteroffer. Let's make it a loan, but I insist that you not start paying it back until at least five years after you graduate. Seven years if you go for your Master's.",3
RORY,"That sounds fair, but I should pay interest.",3
RICHARD,No.,3
RORY,Grandpa.,3
RICHARD,"You are not going to pay me in terest on this money, no way. That's a deal breaker.",3
RORY,Okay.,3
RICHARD,Good.,3
EMILY,Wonderful.,3
RICHARD,"We have a deal. Listen, if journalism doesn't work out, you might consider working for me after you graduate. You've got good deal-making skills. Eye of the tiger.",3
RORY,"I'll keep that in mind. Well, I should go.",3
EMILY,"Rory, does your mother know you're here?",3
RORY,,3
SOOKIE,Where do you wanna sit?,3
LORELAI,Is there no special designated area for family and friends of the valedictorian?,3
SOOKIE,Like a skybox or a velvet rope on one of the rows.,3
LORELAI,We're the Chilton equivalent of 50 Cent's posse. Where are the boys?,3
SOOKIE,Over there.,3
LORELAI,They're doing that thing guys do around fancy buildings.,3
SOOKIE,Talk about their construction.,3
LORELAI,The insurance costs.,3
SOOKIE,"Hey guys, get over here.",3
LORELAI,"Here's a row. Let me see, how many seats do we need? Uh, you, me, Luke, Jackson.",3
SOOKIE,That's four.,3
LORELAI,Plus Picklepuss and Sauerkraut.,3
SOOKIE,Your parents make six.,3
JACKSON,These stones have to be carved by hand.,3
LUKE,Without the tools we have now. No electricity.,3
JACKSON,Just pulleys and fulcrums.,3
SOOKIE,"Hey, Bob Vila, take a seat.",3
LORELAI,"Okay, we have to vow not to make fun of any of the kids because inevitably their family will be sitting right behind us just like at the play.",3
SOOKIE,"Right. Ugh, the big-eared Romeo fiasco of '98. Gotcha.",3
SOOKIE,Who's paging you?,3
LORELAI,"Uh, maybe there's a special surprise party for the valedictorian's mom backstage before the ceremony.",3
SOOKIE,I bet there is.,3
LORELAI,"I'll be right back. Wow, look at the gargoyles.",3
LUKE,"What? Wow, yeah.",3
JACKSON,"Oh, now those have to be imported from Europe.",3
LUKE,,3
PARIS,"Nanny, you brought the kids! Você trouxe as crianças.",3
KIDS,Paris!,3
PARIS,"Ah, minha queride Elzira, Catarina. E olindo Enrique, Antonio Banderas.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, excuse me. Hi, I'm looking for Rory Gilmore. She's the valedictorian. I'm her mom.",3
RORY,Mom.,3
LORELAI,"Uh, no, wait, go away. I wanna tell a bunch of other people that I'm the valedictorian's mom and I'm looking for you.",3
RORY,I've got good news I wanna tell you real quick. Come here.,3
RORY,"Okay, you ready?",3
LORELAI,"I hope so, ready for what?",3
RORY,You're getting your inn.,3
LORELAI,What?,3
RORY,"Go put in the bid on the Dragonfly. You've got the money now, Grandpa's money.",3
LORELAI,What are you talking about? How do I have money?,3
RORY,Grandma and Grandpa are paying for Yale.,3
LORELAI,Now wait a minute.,3
RORY,"I explained the situation, they totally understand, and they're loaning me the money for Yale.",3
LORELAI,When did they approach you about this?,3
RORY,They didn't. I approached them.,3
LORELAI,No.,3
RORY,"I just left them now. It's a done deal, so go make the call, put in the bid, before someone else does.",3
LORELAI,"Rory, honey, do you understand, the Gilmores do nothing altruistically. Strings are attached to everything.",3
RORY,There are no strings.,3
LORELAI,No strings?,3
RORY,"No. I just have to pay them back starting five years after I graduate, and I have to start going back for Friday night dinners.",3
LORELAI,"Um, hello, Pinocchio, those are strings.",3
RORY,"But it was my idea to resume the dinners, and I obligated just me. You are in no way apart of it.",3
LORELAI,"This can't happen, Rory.",3
RORY,I don't want you to defer your dream.,3
LORELAI,You shouldn't have done this behind my back.,3
RORY,"Mom, Yale is my thing. I needed financing, I got it.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, those people, those master manipulators.",3
RORY,"Mom, this was my idea. I'm man ipulating you.",3
LORELAI,They are manipulating you to manipulate me.,3
RORY,How are they doing that?,3
LORELAI,"Rory, don't you see? If you go to Friday night dinners, Mom knows I'll go to just to be with you.",3
RORY,She wasn't thinking that.,3
LORELAI,They're getting exactly what they want.,3
RORY,Don't you see? We're all getting exactly what we want. It's a win-win-win situation.,3
LORELAI,It's not.,3
RORY,It is.,3
LORELAI,"Okay, maybe, maybe it is. But just once, just once, I want you to get exactly what you want, and me to get exactly what I want, and them to get nothing.",3
RORY,,3
LORELAI,Hi.,3
EMILY,Hello.,3
RICHARD,"Oh, hi.",3
LORELAI,"Uh, didn't you see Sookie? We've got seats all saved.",3
EMILY,"Yes, but we didn't know if the whole seating issue had been resolved.",3
LORELAI,"Well, it was. Come on.",3
RICHARD,"Well, I don't rememb er it being fully resolved either.",3
LORELAI,"Well, it was. Come on.",3
EMILY,We didn't know if you'd changed your mind.,3
LORELAI,"Well, I didn't. Come on.",3
RICHARD,It wasn't crystal clear.,3
LORELAI,"Fine, just stay there.",3
EMILY,You're not serious.,3
LORELAI,Ah.,3
LORELAI,"Uh, Mom, Dad, you've met everyone here. Sookie, Jackson, Luke.",3
RICHARD,Hello.,3
JACKSON,Hi.,3
SOOKIE,Hi.,3
LUKE,How ya doing?,3
RICHARD,"No, uh. . .no Christopher?",3
LORELAI,"Uh, no, he's out of town, but he's having us tons of pictures and order him the official video and we may even come back and reenact the whole thing when he gets home. Now sit, relax.",3
LORELAI,"Sookie, long story short, and a partially painful story at that, and hang onto your hat, but we can now put a bid in on the Dragonfly.",3
SOOKIE,What? Are you kidding?,3
LORELAI,No.,3
SOOKIE,How? What happened?,3
LORELAI,I can't go into it now.,3
SOOKIE,"Okay, I've gotta tell you, even with the champagne and the Herb Albert, I've been depressed for days. I couldn't watch the Dating Game anymore.",3
LORELAI,"Well, that's all changed now.",3
SOOKIE,I'll go call the attorney. You sit back and relax and enjoy the graduation.,3
SOOKIE,"This will not happen again, promise.",3
LORELAI,"Uh, you're gonna have to move over one more chair to be part of the group, guys.",3
EMILY,"Oh, I thought maybe someone else was coming.",3
LORELAI,No.,3
RICHARD,You sure?,3
LORELAI,Yes.,3
EMILY,"Because if there is, it would be awkward to move during the ceremony.",3
LORELAI,"Yes, I know what awkward is.",3
LORELAI,What Mom?,3
EMILY,,3
PARIS,"The middle one, Catarina, she bowled a 143 last week.",3
RORY,Impressive.,3
SOOKIE,"Sorry. I was here before a lot of you, it just looks like I'm late. Appearances can be deceiving. So sorry. Real estate agent wasn't in, so I left a message.",3
LORELAI,Rats.,3
SOOKIE,Did Rory walk in?,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, first row. Right in front of the kid with the humongous. . .uh, the really cute kid.",3
SOOKIE,"Darn, I wanted to get a picture of her walking in. I'll get some of her in her seat.",3
SOOKIE,"Excuse me. Sorry. I'm not, I'm not like this. Today I am. I'm with the valedictorian, so. . .",3
HEADMASTERory,"Invited guests, fellow faculty, honored attendees and students, welcome to the Chilton Academy graduating class ceremony of 2003. This year's class is a distinguished assemblage, equal to or surpassing what has proceeded it. In its 200-year history, Chilton has not failed to produce a class that brings only honor to these grounds and to the academy's fine traditions. To begin, I would like to invite the student body president Paris Gellar to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance. Paris?",3
PARIS,"As his parting shot to me, Charleston never responded to the three aspects of the pledge that I had an objection to and considered rewriting. That's not going to stop me from using air quotes.",3
BRAD,"Through good times and bad, Chilton formed us, brought us hope, honed our insight, gave us encouragement. Though my time here was briefly interrupted by my period spent on Broadway hanging out with Stephen Sondheim, I still consider Chilton the most rewarding experience of my young life. Now it had always been my plan in closing to recite a short poem I'd written.",3
LOUISE,But you reconsidered.,3
MADELINE,"Come on, Brad. Go out a winner.",3
BRAD,"But as I read it aloud, I realized the sentiments I wanted to share with my fellow students were better expressed in a favorite song of mine. Cherish is the word I use to describe. . .bong, bong. Bong, bong.",3
RORY,"Oh, Brad.",3
BRAD,"All the feelings that I have hiding here for you inside, bong, bong, bong. You don't know how many times I've wished that I had told you. . .",3
HEADMASTERory,"It's a distinct pleasure for me to introduce to you our valedictorian. This young lady was a second-year transfer from a modest school where she distinguished herself immeasurably. She is humble, hard working, competitive when need be, and unparalleled in her academic achievements. Ladies and Gentlemen, Rory Gilmore.",3
SOOKIE,"Not crying, right?",3
LORELAI,Not crying. Keeping our cool so we don't miss anything.,3
SOOKIE,Tears get in your eyes.,3
LORELAI,Then you miss things.,3
SOOKIE,So we're not crying.,3
LORELAI,Not crying.,3
SOOKIE,Not crying.,3
JACKSON,Not crying. Not crying.,3
LUKE,What?,3
LORELAI,No crying.,3
LUKE,I'm not crying.,3
RORY,"Headmaster Charleston, faculty members, fellow students, family and friends, welcome. We never thought this day would come. We prayed for its quick delivery, crossed days off our calendars, counted hours, minutes, and seconds, and now that it's here, I'm sorry it is because it means leaving friends who inspire me an d teachers who have been my mentors - so many people who have shaped my life and my fellow students' lives impermeably and forever. I live in two worlds. One is a world of books. I've been a resident of Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County, hunted the white whale aboard the Pequod, fought alongside Napoleon, sailed a raft with Huck and Jim, commit ted absurdities with Ignatius J. Reilly, rode a sad train with Anna Karenina, and strolled down Swann's Way. It's a rewarding world, but my second one is by far superior. My second one is populated with characters slightly less eccentric but supremely real, made of flesh and bone, full of love, who are my ultimate inspiration for everything. Richard and Emily Gilmore are kind, decent, unfailingly generous people. They are my twin pillars without whom I could not stand. I am proud to be their grandchild. But my ultimate inspiration comes from my best friend, the dazzling woman from whom I received my name and my life's blood, Lorelai Gilmore.",3
SOOKIE,Uh oh.,3
LORELAI,Hang in there.,3
RORY,"My mother never gave me an y idea that I couldn't do whatever I wanted to do or be whomever I wanted to be. She filled our house with love and fun and books and music, unflagging in her efforts to give me role models from Jane Austen to Eudora Welty to Patti Smith. As she guided me through these incredible eighteen years, I don't know if she ever realized that the person I most wanted to be was her.",3
SOOKIE,Not crying.,3
LORELAI,Crying a little.,3
SOOKIE,"Crying a little, but not blubbering. That's what we meant when we said no crying, no blubbering.",3
RORY,"Thank you, Mom. You are my guidepost for everything.",3
SOOKIE,On the verge of blubbering here.,3
JACKSON,Not doing too well myself.,3
LORELAI,"Not you, too.",3
LUKE,"I'm blubbering, you're freaks.",3
RORY,,3
ANNOUNCERory,Allegra Grace Fass.,3
PARIS,"I swear, I do not recognize half of these people. Hey. What's your name, what's your story?",3
EMILY,"Where is she, do you see her?",3
LORELAI,She's the one in the robe.,3
EMILY,"Lorelai, please.",3
LORELAI,"She's lost in a sea of blue polyester, Mom. I couldn't point her out if I wanted to.",3
JACKSON,"Richard, how much to insure all this?",3
RICHARD,"Well, the insurance is probably not prohibitive, but the deductibles would be enormous. Well into six figures.",3
LUKE,Six figures?,3
JACKSON,That's like having no insurance at all.,3
LUKE,So if there was a fire -,3
LORELAI,"Guys, please stop assessing the value of the building and pay attention. Rory's coming up.",3
RICHARD,"Ooh, ooh, sorry.",3
SOOKIE,I wanna get a closer shot of her getting her diploma.,3
SOOKIE,"Ooh, sorry, sorry, I suck, I'm sorry.",3
ANNOUNCERory,Paris Eustace Gellar.,3
PARIS,"Finally, a name I recognize.",3
HEADMASTERory,"Congratulations, Paris.",3
PARIS,No hard feelings.,3
HEADMASTERory,Okay.,3
ANNOUNCERory,Lorelai Leigh Gilmore.,3
LORELAI,This is it.,3
EMILY,She looks so solemn.,3
RICHARD,Like a Gilmore.,3
HEADMASTERory,"Congratulations, Rory.",3
RORY,"Thank you, Headmaster.",3
ANNOUNCERory,Diana Christine Godby.,3
EMILY,"Lorelai, really.",3
LORELAI,I taught her everything I know.,3
SOOKIE,"Honest to God, last time. Sorry.",3
LORELAI,"Oh my God. Uh, uh, I, I need a pen. I don't have a pen. Luke, give me your pen.",3
LUKE,I don't have a pen.,3
LORELAI,Where's the pen you take orders with?,3
LUKE,You have got to stop assuming that I take pens with me everywhere I go.,3
RICHARD,Never be without a pen.,3
LORELAI,"Thank you, Dad.",3
EMILY,"Really, Lorelai, how many more times are you gonna do that?",3
LORELAI,I think about six.,3
HEADMASTERory,,3
RORY,How was my speech?,3
LORELAI,"It made everyone cry, including stone cold Luke.",3
RORY,"Luke, you old softy.",3
LUKE,I will never live this down.,3
LORELAI,Not with me in your life.,3
LUKE,"I gotta go, I gotta get back to the diner.",3
RORY,"Thanks for coming, Luke.",3
LUKE,"Oh, sure. The building's amazing. So are you.",3
RORY,Thanks.,3
LORELAI,"It really was great of you to come, Luke. It meant a lot to her.",3
LUKE,It was fun.,3
LORELAI,"So if I don't see you, have fun on your trip with Nicole.",3
LUKE,"Oh, we may not go now.",3
LORELAI,What? You were really looking forward to it.,3
LUKE,I don't know if the timing's right and. . .things are kinda weird right now.,3
LORELAI,Oh no.,3
LUKE,What?,3
LORELAI,It's because I teased you about the commit ment thing and proposing. I ruined it.,3
LUKE,"No, that's not it.",3
LORELAI,"Please, promise me that's not it. It would break my heart.",3
LUKE,But you weren't wrong about that. It got me thinking and it is kind of like committing to her.,3
LORELAI,So?,3
LUKE,I don't wanna lead her on.,3
LORELAI,"But you like her, Luke. You like her a lot, don't you?",3
LUKE,"Yeah, she's great.",3
LORELAI,Then go. No matter what she's reading into it.,3
LUKE,Really? You think that's okay considering. . .I don't know. . .everything?,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, I do.",3
LUKE,"Oh, okay. I'll probably go then.",3
LORELAI,Good.,3
LUKE,I guess I was just nervous about nothing.,3
LORELAI,"That's what I think, too.",3
LUKE,I'll see ya in a couple months.,3
LORELAI,"Yeah, I'll see you then.",3
PARIS,I guess we should say our goodbyes. Nanny made me a special dinner. She makes a mean farturas.,3
RORY,"Well, good, I'm glad you found me. I wanted to say goodbye, too.",3
PARIS,"Good. Well, good luck.",3
RORY,"You know, it's weird, most of the time I really hated you.",3
PARIS,"Yeah, I really hated you, too.",3
LORELAI,Hey.,3
RICHARD,"Well, I think it might be time to present Rory with her graduation gift.",3
RORY,"Oh, you guys didn't have to get me anything.",3
EMILY,Nonsense.,3
RICHARD,"Uh, this one wouldn't fit in an envelope, so follow me please.",3
EMILY,We're really excited about this one.,3
LORELAI,So am I.,3
EMILY,Good.,3
RICHARD,"Rory, there is your gift. It's the one with the bow.",3
RORY,"Um, Grandpa.",3
EMILY,Richard.,3
RICHARD,"Oh, for Pete's sake. Well, it was the only one there when I drove it up.",3
EMILY,You should've put a more distinctive bow on it.,3
RICHARD,"Well, how was I supposed to know that every kid at Chilton was getting a car?",3
RORY,You got me a c ar?,3
RICHARD,We got you a car.,3
RORY,That's amazing. Thank you. Thank you. Which one is it?,3
LORELAI,Or did you get her one for every day of the week like the underwear?,3
RICHARD,"We got her one car. It's a little Prius. It's safe, it gets great gas mileage.",3
EMILY,And it's the one that Leonardo DiCaprio drives.,3
RORY,"Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. I love you guys.",3
EMILY,"We love you, too.",3

LORELAI,A hang up?,3
RORY,Yeah.,3
LORELAI,You're getting a lot of those lately.,3
RORY,Hello? Hello?,3
RORY,"Jess, is that you? Jess, I'm pretty sure it's you and I'm pretty sure you've been calling and not saying anything but wanna say something. Hello? You're not going to talk? Fine, I'll talk. You didn't handle things right at all. You could've talked to me. You could've told me that you were having trouble in school and weren't going to graduate, and that your dad had been there, but you didn't. And you ended up not taking me to my prom and not coming to my graduation and leaving again without saying goodbye again, and that's fine, I get it, but that's it for me. I'm going to Europe tomorrow and I'm going to Yale and I'm moving on. And I'm not going to pine. I hope you didn't think I was going to pine, okay? I think. . .I think I may have loved you, but I just need to let it go. So, that's it, I guess. Um, I hope you're good. I want you to be good, and, um, okay, so, goodbye. That word sounds really lame an d stupid right now, but there it is. Goodbye.",3
LORELAI,Hey. You okay?,3
RORY,I'm okay.,3
LORELAI,Come on.,3

LUKE,"Oh. It was a really nice ceremony, wasn't it?",3
LORELAI,"Yeah, it was beautiful.",3
LUKE,What's up?,3
LORELAI,I just wanted to say something to you in case we don't see each other before you go on your trip.,3
LUKE,"Sure, what?",3
LORELAI,Don't get engaged.,3
LUKE,"What, why?",3
LUKE,,3
RORY,"Mom, wait.",3
LORELAI,"Hurry, hurry.",3
RORY,This outfit produces a lot of wind resistance.,3
LORELAI,Okay.,3
RORY,What are we doing?,3
LORELAI,Leaving our mark. Got a knife?,3
RORY,A knife? For what?,3
LORELAI,"Carving our initials. Come on, knife, knife.",3
RORY,"Uh, like the switchblade I keep in my sock? No, I left it at home.",3
LORELAI,"I must have something in here. Ah, safety pin, perfect.",3
RORY,We can't do this.,3
LORELAI,"Yes, we can. People need to know we were here.",3
RORY,I'm in the yearbook.,3
LORELAI,How about the wall?,3
RORY,"No, that's too out in the open. They'll trace it back to us.",3
LORELAI,They'll see LG and RG and figure out it was us?,3
RORY,They're are no dorks here.,3
LORELAI,Somewhere in the floor?,3
RORY,This marble is two hundred years old. Harriet Beecher Stowe walked on this marble.,3

RORY,Was donated by Robert Frost.,3
LORELAI,The sconce.,3
RORY,Was ceremonially lit for the first time by Thomas Edison.,3
LORELAI,"Geez, is there anything in this whole room that some famous dead person didn't have something to do with.",3
LORELAI,"Ooh, cool it, cool it. And this is some very interesting architectural do-dads and hoo-ha's.",3
RORY,And wingdings and tum-tum's.,3
LORELAI,That was close.,3
RORY,"Look, just carve it really tiny here on the baseboard of the wall, and do it reversed, so GL and GR.",3
LORELAI,"Oh, maybe it's not such a good idea.",3
RORY,The madness passes.,3
SOOKIE,,3
RORY,Party?,3
LORELAI,Just a little gathering.,3
RORY,Cool.,3
LORELAI,We'll meet you back at our house.,3
SOOKIE,"Okay, see you there.",3
