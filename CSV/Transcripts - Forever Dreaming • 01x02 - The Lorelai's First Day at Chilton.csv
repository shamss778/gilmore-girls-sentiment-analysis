1,9,Transcribed by Jeannette Haworth
1,10,(Lorelai and Rory are sitting on the couch on the porch in front of the house. Lorelai is painting
1,11,Rory's toenails red. Rory squirts whipped cream into her mouth.)
1,12,Lorelai : (sarcastically) That's nice.
1,13,Rory : Thank you.
1,14,"L : Don't move, please."
1,15,"R : So, Why are you insisting on doing this."
1,16,"L : Well, because you're going to be starting private school tomorrow."
1,17,"R : Yes, but I'm going to be wearing shoes. Nobody's going to see my feet."
1,18,"L : Okay, But everybody knows that private school girls are bad. And bad girls always wear red nail"
1,19,polish.
1,20,(There is a lull in the conversation.)
1,21,L : Are you nervous?
1,22,R : About what?
1,23,L : About starting Chilton.
1,24,R : Well I wasn't until I heard about all those bad girls.
1,25,(They both laugh.)
1,26,"(Lane Kim, Rory's friend runs up.)"
1,27,Lane : You guys! XTC. Apple Venus Volume 2.
1,28,(Lorelai and Lane run into the house.)
1,29,R : But you only finished half my toes!
1,30,L : Who cares?! You're going to be wearing shoes anyway!
1,31,(Rory rolls her eyes and goes into the house.)Posted: 10/24/00 22:21

2,3,(Shows an opening shot of the house.)
2,4,"(Lorelai is sleeping. Rory, dressed in her Chilton clothes, opens the door to her mom's bedroom.)"
2,5,R : Mom!
2,6,L : (gasps) What? God! Hi. (in a whiny tone)
2,7,R : What are you doing?
2,8,L : Having a heart attack.
2,9,R : I thought you were up. It's 7:10!
2,10,L : What?
2,11,R : It's 7:10.
2,12,(Rory grabs her pillow.)
2,13,L : Stop it! It's a quarter to six. (grabs back pillow)
2,14,R : No it's not!
2,15,L : Yes it is! I set the clock for a quarter to six so it's..
2,16,(Rory grabs clock and shows her the time.)
2,17,L : It's 7:10!
2,18,"(Lorelai jumps out of bed and stumbles around, disoriented. Rory slams down clock.)"
2,19,R : I can't be late on my first day of school. Do you know what happens to people when they're late
2,20,on their first day?
2,21,(Lorelai is rummag ing franticly through her dresser for clothes.)
2,22,L : It's shorter?
2,23,R : They're labeled 'The late girl'.
2,24,L : Ohh! So dramatic. Where's the bathroom?
2,25,(Rory takes her by the shoulders and steers her through the door.)
2,26,R : We have to go! What if there's traffic? Mom!
2,27,(Lorelai runs into the bathroom and shuts the door.)
2,28,L : I had this all planned. I was gonna get up early. I was gonna get coffee. I was gonna take a
2,29,shower. I was gonna pick up my clothes from the dry cleaners.
3,1,(Lorelai opens the door.)
3,2,L : (sighs) Oh my god. My clothes.
3,3,R : What?!
3,4,(Lorelai walks down the hall with Rory trailing after her.)
3,5,L : I don't have any clean clothes.
3,6,R : It's 7:15.
3,7,L : All my nice things were dirty.
3,8,R : It's 7:16.
3,9,"(Lorelai look in her closet, then turns away.)"
3,10,L : I was gonna wear my blue suit with the flippy skirt. I look so great in the flippy skirt.
3,11,R : It's 7:17.
3,12,"L : You know what, time lady? Why don't you go downstairs and warm up the car? That would be"
3,13,really super. Thank you.
3,14,R : Just hurry!
3,15,"(Rory goes downstairs, Lorelai rummag es through a drawer.)"
3,16,L : This sucks! This sucks!
3,17,R : It's 7:18 (Rory calls from below.)
3,18,"L : Oh, for the love of god! (sighs) She sits on the bed and puts on socks. This is the last time I ever"
3,19,buy anything just because it's furry. (talking about clock)
3,20,(scene changes)
3,21,"(Lorelai is running down the steps in cowboy boots, really short frayed shorts, and a bright pink"
3,22,tye-dyed tight tee-shirt. She's hurriedly putting her hair into a messy ponytail. Rory is standing at
3,23,the foot of the stairs and looks up.)
3,24,R : It's 7--
3,25,L : Don't even think of finishing that sentence. (sighs) What?!
3,26,R : Nothing. I just didn't know the rodeo was in town.
3,27,"L : All right, that's it. (grabs a picture frame) I'm bringing the baby pictures."
3,28,(Lorelai runs out the door with Rory in pursuit.)
3,29,R : No! I'm sorry! I love the rodeo! The rodeo rules!
3,30,(scene changes)
4,1,"(camera pans through town, finally settling on the jeep, and then the Stars Hollow sign.)"
4,2,L : I am so done with plans. I am never ever making one again. It never works. I spend the day
4,3,obsessing over why it didn't work and what I could've done differently.
4,4,(scene changes)
4,5,"(inside jeep, Lorelai is driving, Rory sitting in passenger seat.)"
4,6,L : I'm analyzing all my shortcomings when all I really need to be doing is vowing to never ever
4,7,"make a plan ever again which I'm doing now. Having, once again, been the innocent victim of my"
4,8,own stupid plans.
4,9,(they go past her old school and Rory looks out at all the kids having fun.)
4,10,"L : God, I need some coffee. (sighs)"
4,11,"(screen shows Jeep driving down several different roads, and then a road sign that says Hartford,"
4,12,14 miles.)
4,13,"(screen switches to show different gargoyles, and then the outside of Chilton.)"
4,14,"(Rory and Lorelai sit in Jeep, peering out at Chilton.)"
4,15,R : I rememb er it being smaller. (she looks worried)
4,16,L : Yeah. And less.. (she looks intimidated)
4,17,R : Off with their heads.
4,18,"L : Ah. (tilts her head, peering up.)"
4,19,"R: (glancing at her mom, does the same.) What are you looking at?"
4,20,L : I'm just trying to see if there's a hunchback up in that bell tower.
4,21,"R : So, how do I look?"
4,22,"L : (sighs, sits back and beams with motherly pride.) You look great."
4,23,R : Really? (skeptical)
4,24,L : Really. You are an amazing kid. You have earned this. You just go in there and show them what
4,25,smart really is. I love you. Call me if  you need me. (reaches for gear)
4,26,"R: (looks worried) You're kidding, right?"
4,27,L : No! Call me if  you need anything. I'm great at making up dirty cheers.
4,28,R : You have to go in with me.
4,29,"L : Rory, come on. (looks at her clothes meaningfully.)"
4,30,R : You have to meet  the headmaster.
4,31,"L : Well, look at me! I can't meet  anyone who does anything in there. I look like that chick from the"
5,1,'Dukes of Hazzard'.
5,2,R : This is my first day. You are not getting out of going in there with me.
5,3,"(Rory and Lorelai get out of the jeep. Two moms walking by stare at Lorelai, who drops her coat."
5,4,They scurry away.)
5,5,L : Good morning!
5,6,"L : (to Rory) Oh, well, we're gonna be best friends."
5,7,(Lorelai puts her coat on as they walk into the Chilton courtyard.)
5,8,"L : So, where do we go."
5,9,"R : (looks at paper in her hand) Uh, the Ambroise building."
5,10,L : Which is?
5,11,"R : The big, scary one."
5,12,L : Oh great! Thanks for the input.
5,13,"(man walking by looks over at them, especially with some interest to Lorelai.)"
5,14,"(they look around, slightly bewildered)"
5,15,Man : lost?
5,16,"L : Oh, yeah. We're looking for the headmaster's office in the Ambroise building."
5,17,"Man : Ah, okay. Well, this is it right here. (he points beside them) Down the stairs, make a left and"
5,18,the headmaster's office is at the end of the hall.
5,19,L : Great. Thank you.
5,20,Man : You're welcome.
5,21,"(Rory grabs Lorelai's arm to go, but the man extends a hand.)"
5,22,"Man : Uh, I'm Ian Jack. My daughter Julia goes to school here. (they shake hands)"
5,23,"L : Hi! I'm Lorelai Gilmore. This is my daughter, Rory. (Rory looks slightly uncomfortable.)"
5,24,"Ian : Your daughter? Really. (surprised) Wow, that's great. Uh  I mean, daughters are a great thing."
5,25,L : We're big fans. (they're flirting)
5,26,"Ian : (laughing) Yeah. So, is your husband here? I'd love to meet him."
5,27,"L : Um, no. I'm not married. I'd love to meet your wife, though."
5,28,Ian : I'm divorced.
5,29,L : Shame.
6,1,R : Excuse me. I really got to..
6,2,"L : (grabs Rory's arm) Right! We gotta go meet the big guy, and I gotta get back to work."
6,3,(they rush off)
6,4,Ian : (calls) Where do you work?
6,5,L : (rushes back) At an inn. The Independence Inn. I run it.
6,6,Ian : Really?
6,7,"L : In a different outfit, of course."
6,8,"Ian : Ha. Well, It was nice to meet  you, Lorelai. Good luck in school, Rory. I'll tell Julia to look out"
6,9,for you.
6,10,"R : Great, thanks."
6,11,Ian : See you.
6,12,"(Lorelai waves a little, smiles, mouths 'bye'.)"
6,13,"L : What a nice, nice man."
6,14,"R : You're feeling pretty good about yourself right now, aren't you."
6,15,L : Yeah (still smiling)
6,16,R : Do you want me to get you a mirror?
6,17,"L : I'm back. Let's go. (smile is gone, they rush off)"
6,18,(scene changes)
6,19,(Lorelai and Rory are walking down the stairs in Chilton. They look around.)
6,20,"L : Oh, good. More big stuff. (sarcastically)"
6,21,R : Turn left.
6,22,L : Oh
6,23,"(Rory and Lorelai walk out of the screen. The camera is on three sour looking girls, staring after"
6,24,"them. They roll their eyes, look expressively at one another, and continue on their way.)"
6,25,(screen changes)
6,26,"(Lorelai and Rory are walking down a hallway, almost to the headmaster's office. They look at their"
6,27,"surroundings with apprehension. They get to the door and stand in front of it, just staring.)"
6,28,L : You ready?
6,29,R : No.
6,30,L : You ready?
7,1,R : Yes.
7,2,"(They open the doors, and step into a room that contains a desk with a strict looking woman"
7,3,wearing library glasses sitting at it. They stop in front of her.)
7,4,L : (clears throat) Um.. Excuse me. (Secretary looks up suddenly. She jumps back slightly.) Oh!
7,5,"How.. Wow. Hi. I.. I'm Lorelai Gilmore. This is my daughter, Lorelai Gilmore. I named her after me. I"
7,6,"was in the hospital all whacked out on Demerol. (glances at Rory, realizes she's rambling.) Never"
7,7,"mind. B-B-But we call her 'Rory'. It's short for Lorelai or even 'Hey, you' depending on the.. (Rory"
7,8,nudges her) Is the headmaster here?
7,9,"Secretary : (gets up, removes her glasses) One moment. (Walks briskly away.)"
7,10,(The Gilmores watch her until she closes the door.)
7,11,"L : (whispering) See, that's what happens when you go to bed with your makeup on."
7,12,"(Rory grins, Lorelai sighs)"
7,13,"(Door opens behind them, Secretary stands there stiffly, as if announcing a guest.)"
7,14,Secretary : Headmaster Charleston will see you now.
7,15,L : (clears throat) Great. Thanks.
7,16,"(They walk into room, secretary shuts door.)"
7,17,"Headmaster : (extending hand) Ms. Gilmore, I'm headmaster Charleston."
7,18,"L : Hi. Wow. It's really nice to meet .. (looks around, looks again at corner, sees her mother on"
7,19,"couch) Mom. Uh, ex.. What are you doing here?"
7,20,Grandmother : (sweeps past Lorelai) I came to wish my granddaughter luck on her first day of
7,21,"school. (Lorelai looks exasperated) Rory, you look wonderful in that uniform!"
7,22,"L : You didn't have to come al l the way out here, Mom."
7,23,Grandmother : This gave me a c hance to make sure that Hanlin here takes good care of Rory.
7,24,L : (gestures to Headmaster) You're Hanlin.
7,25,Headmaster : Hanlin Charleston.
7,26,Grandmother : Hanlin's wife and I are on the symphony fundraising committee together.
7,27,L : Wow. That's great.
7,28,Headmaster : Your father and I are golf rivals. We're still fighting it out to see which one is worse.
7,29,"Grandmother : Oh, yes. We're all old friends."
7,30,"L : Well, there's nothing like friends. Especially if they're old."
7,31,(Everyone looks a tad oddly around at her remark.)
8,1,Headmaster : Would you like to take off your coat and have a seat?
8,2,"L : (looks frightened) Oh, no. No, I'm fine."
8,3,Headmaster : I'm afraid they were a little overzealous with the furnace this morning. It's quite
8,4,warm in here.
8,5,L : I like it warm. (nodding her head like an idiot)
8,6,"Grandmother : Lorelai, take off your coat and sit down. You don't want Hanlin to think you're rude."
8,7,(comman ding tone of voice)
8,8,"L : (looking extremely uncomfortable and embarrassed, takes off coat. Everyone stares,"
8,9,grandmother rolls her eyes. Exhales loudly.) Laundry day.
8,10,"Grandmother : Hanlin, did you know that Rory has a 4.0 grade point average?"
8,11,"L : I'm sure he does, Mom."
8,12,Grandmother : This is a very special girl. You take good care of her.
8,13,"Headmaster : We'll do our best, Emily."
8,14,(everyone sits down)
8,15,"L : Rory's not going to be a problem. She's totally low maintenance. You know, like a Honda. You"
8,16,"know, they're just easy, just.. (Rory looks embarrassed) Nice office."
8,17,"Grandmother : Well, I don't think we should take up anymore of your precious time. It was lovely to"
8,18,see you. Give Bitty our love. (kisses cheeks with headmaster)
8,19,Headmaster : Tell Richard I'll see him at the club Sunday.
8,20,"Grandmother : Have a wonderful day, Rory. I want to hear all about it. Do you need a ride or is your"
8,21,horse parked outside? (to Lorelai) (walks out of room)
8,22,"L : It's so nice to meet  you. (shakes hands with headmaster, kisses Rory's forehead.) Have a great"
8,23,day.
8,24,"Headmaster : Oh, you don't want to forget your coat."
8,25,"L : (turns) Oh no, 'cause that would be embarrassing. (laughs, walks out of office.)"
8,26,(scene changes)
8,27,(Lorelai and Grandmother are walking down the hall.)
8,28,Grandmother : How do you leave the house looking like that? What kind of an impression did you
8,29,think you were gonna make?
8,30,"L : (sighs) What are you doing here, mother?"
8,31,"Grandmother : I told you, I came to put in a good word for Rory."
8,32,L : She didn't need a good word.
9,1,"Grandmother : I'm not allowed here, is that it?"
9,2,L : I didn't say that.
9,3,Grandmother : I'm allowed to pay for it. But I can't actually set foot on the premises. I just want to
9,4,get the rules straight. How about the street. Can I drive down the street? Maybe I should just avoid
9,5,the neighborhood altogether. Although my doctor is right down the block. Maybe I can get special
9,6,permission if I'm bleeding.
9,7,"L : (looking incredibly annoyed, her patience is wearing thin.) I'm sorry. I was just surprised to see"
9,8,you here.
9,9,Grandmother : I thought it was important for this school to know they had a Gilmore amongst
9,10,them.
9,11,L : A very good thought.
9,12,Grandmother : And that some of the Gilmores actually own clothing.
9,13,"L : And on that note, I have to get to work. I'll see you later."
9,14,"Grandmother : Dinner, Friday night. No spurs, please."
9,15,"(Lorelai walks away, thrusts out her arms in annoyance.)"
9,16,(Commer cials)
9,17,(Shows opening shot of the outside of Chilton.)
9,18,(Headmaster and Rory are sitting in his office.)
9,19,"Headmaster : You're obviously a bright girl, Miss. Gilmore."
9,20,Rory : Thank you.
9,21,"Headmaster : Good grades. Teachers like you. Not a lot of social activities, though."
9,22,"Rory : Oh, well, just living at Stars Hollow is kind of a social activity, actually."
9,23,Headmaster : Nothing in your school appealed to you?
9,24,Rory : I work at my mother's inn after school sometimes. And I was in the German Club for a while.
9,25,"But there were only three of us. Then two left after seeing ""Schindler's List""."
9,26,Headmaster : What are your aspirations?
9,27,Rory : I want to go to Harvard to study Journalism and Political Science.
9,28,Headmaster : On your way to being 
9,29,Rory : Christiane Amanpour.
9,30,Headmaster : Really?
9,31,Rory : Yes.
10,1,Headmaster : Not Cokie Roberts?
10,2,Rory : No.
10,3,"Headmaster : Not Oprah, Rosie, or one of the women from 'The View'?"
10,4,Rory : No.
10,5,Headmaster : Why do you wish to be Christiane Amanpour?
10,6,"Rory : I don't wish to be her, exactly. I just want to do what she does."
10,7,Headmaster : Which is?
10,8,"Rory : Travel, see the world up close, report on what's really going on, and to be part of something"
10,9,big.
10,10,Headmaster : And to be a part of something big you have to be on TV? Why not lead the police on a
10,11,"high speed chase, it's a quicker way to achieve this goal."
10,12,Rory : Being on TV has nothing to do with it. Maybe I'll be a Journalist and write books or articles
10,13,about what I see. I just want to be sure that I see something. (Headmaster looks at papers.) You'll
10,14,notice the debating teams also missing from my resume.
10,15,Headmaster : (nods and stands up) I've known your Grandparents for quite some time.
10,16,Rory : I know.
10,17,"Headmaster : In fact, I was at a party at their house just last week where I had the most delicious"
10,18,lobster puffs I've ever eaten. I'm very fond of them.
10,19,Rory : That's nice.
10,20,(Headmaster sits down across from her.)
10,21,"Headmaster : None of this, however, will be of any benefit to you. Chilton has one of the highest"
10,22,"academic standards of any school in America. You may have been the smartest girl at Stars Hollow,"
10,23,"but this is a different place. The pressures are greater, the rules are stricter, and the expectations"
10,24,"are high. If you make it through, you will have received one of the finest educations one can get."
10,25,"And there should be no reason why you should not achieve all your goals. However, since you are"
10,26,"starting late, and are not used to this highly competitive atmosphere, there is a good chance that"
10,27,you will fail. That is fine. Failure is a part of life. But not a part of Chilton. Understand?
10,28,"R : (looking more and more unsure of herself.) So, you liked the lobster puffs, huh."
10,29,Headmaster : Take this to Miss. James in the administration office across the hall.
10,30,"(he hands her the folder, she takes it and leaves the room, he puts on his glasses.)"
10,31,(scene changes)
10,32,"(Rory walks into the administration office, she goes up to the desk and puts down the folder.)"
10,33,"R : Hi, I'm looking for Miss James?"
10,34,Miss James : Name?
11,1,R : Lorelai Gilmore. But I go by Rory.
11,2,"Miss James : Fill this out, please."
11,3,(Miss James takes the folder and gives Rory a sheet and a pencil. Miss James puts down the folder
11,4,on a desk to the side. The girl at the desk looks around and stealthily takes the folder and gives it
11,5,to somebody out the window.)
11,6,(scene changes)
11,7,"(It is in the bushes, outside the window. There are three girls there, the same ones that stared at"
11,8,Rory on the stairs.)
11,9,Girl 1 : Well?
11,10,Girl 2 : Shut up.
11,11,Girl 3 : Hurry. Please. Spiders.
11,12,Girl 2 : Lorelai Gilmore.
11,13,Girl 1 : Nice stripper name.
11,14,Girl 2 : Formerly of Stars Hollow High School.
11,15,Girl 1 : Where's that?
11,16,"Girl 2 : Make a left at the haystacks and follow the cows. Perfect attendance, 4.0 grade point"
11,17,average.
11,18,"Girl 3 : Bugs, dirt, twigs."
11,19,Girl 2 : She's a Journalism majo r.
11,20,Girl 1 : That means she's going out for the school paper.
11,21,Girl 2 : Not necessarily. She's got a thousand recommendations in here. Popular with the adults.
11,22,Girl 1 : And going out for the school paper.
11,23,Girl 2 : You don't know she's going out for the paper. She'll never catch up. She's a month behind.
11,24,Girl 1 : You can tutor her. Be like a big sister.
11,25,Girl 2 : You're funny.
11,26,"Girl 3 : Okay, lizard, goodbye."
11,27,Girl 2 : Why are they letting all these extra people in? They just take up space and screw up the
11,28,curve. We don't need any new kids here.
11,29,Girl 1 : Too late.
11,30,"(Girl 2 says psst out the window, someone takes the folder.)"
12,1,(scene changes)
12,2,"(back in the office, Miss James is giving stuff to Rory.)"
12,3,"Miss James : Here's your locker number, here's your schedule. Here's the rules of the school and the"
12,4,"Chilton code of honor. Here are the words to the school song, which must be recited upon demand."
12,5,"This an happen anytime, anyplace. If you do it in Latin you get extra credit. Do you have any"
12,6,questions?
12,7,"R : Uh, not at the moment."
12,8,"Miss James : If you do, you can make an appointment with your guidance counselor, Mr. Winters. He"
12,9,"handles everything but Bulimia and pregnancy. For that, you have to go to the nurse, or Coach"
12,10,Rubens. Welcome to Chilton.
12,11,(scene changes)
12,12,(Lorelai is walking down the road by Luke's diner with her dry cleaning. She goes into the door and
12,13,"passes a man on his way out, smiling at him.)"
12,14,L : (sighs) I already had the longest day of my life and it's only ten o'clock.
12,15,Luke : (fixing what looks like a toaster) There's no coffee.
12,16,L : That's not funny.
12,17,Luke : I can give you herbal tea.
12,18,L : This is not an herbal tea morning. This is a coffee morning.
12,19,Luke : Every morning for you is a coffee morning.
12,20,L : This is a jumbo coffee morning. I need coffee in an IV.
12,21,Luke : I can give you tea and a balance bar.
12,22,"L : Please, please, please tell me you're kidding."
12,23,Luke : I'm kidding. (goes back and gets the coffee pot.)

24,16,"L : God, this has been one hectic, bizarro day for me."
24,17,Luke : Yeah?
24,18,"L : Yeah. This morning with the being late. And my mother with her existing. Oh, and this father."
24,19,This father from Ch ilton. He drove all the way from Hartford just to ask me out.
24,20,Luke : Really? Are you going? (trying to appear like he doesn't care)
24,21,L : No. He's got a kid in school with Rory. The whole thing just seemed a little weird.
24,22,Luke : Good.
24,23,L : Good?
24,24,"Luke : Yeah, I think it's good that you turned him down."
24,25,L : Okay.
24,26,"Luke : I mean, he's probably old, right?"
24,27,L : Old?
24,28,"Luke : I mean, he's got a kid in high school."
24,29,"L : Well, so do I."
24,30,"Luke : Yeah, but you were young when you had Rory. Most people aren't that young. Most people"
24,31,are..
25,1,L : Old.
25,2,Luke : Yeah.
25,3,L : Like this guy who asked me out.
25,4,Luke : But you're not going.
25,5,"L : No. No, I'm not going."
25,6,"(she kind of smiles a bit, thinks he likes her, her cell phone rings, he points to the sign that says no"
25,7,cell phones)
25,8,"L : Oh, that's me. Hi Babette. What? Okay. No. No, I'll be right there. Thanks. (hangs up) Uh, I have"
25,9,to go. (pulls out wallet)
25,10,Luke : Keep it. I gave you decaf.
25,11,(she frowns and walks out the door)

25,13,(A man and a woman holding a cat are sitting in their yard. They live right next to the Gilmores.
25,14,Lorelai's jeep pulls up and she gets out)
25,15,L : Hey.
25,16,"Babette : Oh, Lorelai, I'm so sorry I had to call you like this."
25,17,"L : That's okay, Babette. I appreciate it."
25,18,"Babette : All of a sudden, they pull up, get out of the truck, and start sniffing around. It's very"
25,19,strange.
25,20,L : Let me go talk to them.
25,21,"(Lorelai pets cat, Man gets up and stands next to Babette)"
25,22,Man : Tell her about the gnome.
25,23,Babette : They kicked a gnome.
25,24,L : What?
25,25,Babette : Right in the head.
25,26,Man : That's just not cool.
25,27,L : I'm very sorry. Is the gnome okay?
25,28,"Babette: He's fine, sugar. But I wouldn't trust these boys. Gnome kicking says a lot about a man's"
25,29,character.
25,30,"L : Yes, well, I'm gonna go take care of this. Thanks."
26,1,"(she walks over to her house, men are on the porch, she goes up the steps to talk to them)"
26,2,"L : Hey. Um, what are you doing?"
26,3,Man 1 : You live here?
26,4,L : Yeah.
26,5,Man 1 : I'm supposed to install a DSL for a Lorelai Gilmore. Is that you?
26,6,"L : Yes, but.."
26,7,Man 1 : I'm Mick.
26,8,L : Nice to meet  you. Could you get off my porch?
26,9,"Mick: I was told that you wouldn't be here, but to look for a ceramic frog with a key inside. We"
26,10,can't find the frog.
26,11,L : I didn't order a DSL.
26,12,"Mick : The order was placed by an -- Emily Gilmore (grandmother). We would've been done by now,"
26,13,but the frog search put us way behind.
26,14,"Man 2 : Hey, Mick, found it."
26,15,Mick : You found the frog?
26,16,"Man 2 : It wasn't a frog, it was a turtle."
26,17,Mick : It says here it's a frog.
26,18,L : Turtle.
26,19,Mick : Really?
26,20,L : Trust me. I'm going to have to cancel that DSL order.
26,21,Mick : You sure? It's already paid for.
26,22,"L : Yeah, I know. We don't need a DSL, so thanks for coming, and you guys can just go."
26,23,"(the guys leave, Lorelai walks over to the jeep)"
26,24,Babette : Is there a problem?
26,25,"L : Oh, nothing Shakespeare couldn't turn into a really good play."

27,18,Grandmother : What on earth..?
27,19,L : You're not buying us a DSL.
27,20,"Grandmother : Lorelai, this is hardly the place."
27,21,"L : I canceled the order, and it's not happening."
27,22,Grandmother : But Rory needs the Internet for her school.
27,23,L : We have the Internet.
27,24,Grandmother : This is faster.
27,25,"L : Well, we like our internet slow, okay? We can turn it on, walk around, dance, make a sandwich."
27,26,"With DSL, there's no dancing, no walking, and we'd starve. It'd be all work and no play. Have you"
27,27,"not seen ""The Shining"", Mom?"
27,28,Grandmother : What on earth are you talking about?
27,29,"L : Also, there will be no cars, no parking spaces. And all the uniforms will be supplied by me. The"
27,30,mother. That's final. There will be no discussion.
27,31,"Grandmother : You're being stubborn, as usual."
28,1,"L : No, Mom, I'm not being stubborn. I'm being me! The same person who always needed to work"
28,2,out her own problems and take care of herself. Because that's the way I was born. That's how I am!
28,3,"Grandmother : Florence, I'm dripping."
28,4,"L : I appreciate what you have done for Rory in paying for this school, That will not be forgotten."

28,21,"L : Triple caps, easy foam. If that doesn't work, we'll stick our fingers in a light socket. (laughs,"
28,22,"picks up backpack) Come here. (staggers under weight) What, do they expect you to get smart all"
28,23,in one day?
28,24,"R : Oh, they expect a lot of things."
28,25,L : So tell me.
28,26,"R : I don't know. It was just one big, long, scary, tweedy, bad eight hours."

28,31,"L : You're kidding me. Wow, I can't believe they still say that."
29,1,R : Why? What does it mean?
29,2,"L : It means like, Virgin Mary. It means they think you look like a goody-goody."
29,3,R : You're kidding.
29,4,L : No.
29,5,R : Well what would they have called me if they thought I looked like a sl*t?
29,6,"L : Well, they might have added a Magdalene to it."

29,19,heads.
29,20,Lane : Really?

30,4,L : Bye. (watches her leave) A pizza for your thoughts.
30,5,R : I wish I could figure out a way to get Paris off my back.
30,6,"L : Yeah, angry chicks are the worst. When I was in high school I had a Paris."
30,7,R : Yeah?
30,8,L : It was horrible.
30,9,R : How'd you get rid of her?
30,10,L : I got pregnant and dropped out.
30,11,R : What if I just learn to french braid her hair.
30,12,"L : Even better. Sweetie, you can't let those kids get you down. Do you want me to talk to anybody?"
30,13,"A parent, a teacher, a big guy named Moose?"
30,14,R : I'll just figure it out for myself.
30,15,L : Okay. (sees Rory laugh) What?
