DRAGONFLY INN – EXTERIOR
[The Jeeps pulls up with Lorelai driving]
LORELAI: I'm telling you, it's her.
RORY: Trust me, it's not.
LORELAI: It is.
RORY: Why would Christiane Amanpour be hanging out at the Dragonfly?
LORELAI: I don't know.
RORY: She wouldn't.
LORELAI: She is.
RORY: You went up to her and said hi, and she said, "Hi, I'm Christiane Amanpour, nice to meet you"?
[The Jeep stops and the girls get out]
LORELAI: No, I didn't go up to her at all. I looked at here and saw that it was her, and I went to get
you.
RORY: So I could look at a fake Christiane Amanpour?
LORELAI: She's real.
RORY: Yeah. Rememb er the time w hen you thought saw Sandra Day O'Connor?
LORELAI: Yeah well this is different and I haven't had any cough syrup.
RORY: I guarantee you it's not her.
[They enter the Inn]
LORELAI: You doubt my ability to recognize a glamorous, international w*r correspondent?
RORY: I guarantee you it's not her. Oh, my god, that's Christiane Amanpour!
LORELAI: That's what I told you.
RORY: I can't meet  Christiane Amanpour in my pajamas.
LORELAI: I tried to get you to change, you wouldn't change.Posted: 05/27/07 05:54RORY: Well how long has she been here?
LORELAI: I don't know I just saw her eating breakfast and I went home and got you. Hey, Michel,
Michel, how long has Christiane Amanpour been here?
MICHEL: Ah she checked in late last night, room 7.
LORELAI: She's staying here?
RORY: [gasps]
LORELAI: You didn't tell me?
MICHEL: I wanted to avoid yet another embarrassing incident.
LORELAI: What are you talking about?
MICHEL: You always embarrass yourself when celebrities stay at the inn.
LORELAI: I do not.
MICHEL: Jane Pauley, Harry Belafonte, Marisa Tomei.
RORY: He's right, you know?
LORELAI: No, no, Marisa Tomei's mother's best friend is my hairdresser's cousin's roommate. That's
just freaky.
MICHEL: I'm just saying you make them uncomfortable.
LORELAI: I run an inn. These are my guests. What am I supposed to do -- ignore them?
MICHEL: I think that might be best.
LORELAI: I'm gonna go over and say hi and see if she'll meet you.
RORY: What? Okay. Wait. Don't be funny.
[Rory goes to "hide" at reception while Lorelai goes to Christiane Amanpour]
LORELAI: Excuse me, Ms. Amanpour?
Christiane Amanpour: Yes.
LORELAI: Hello, I'm Lorelai Gilmore. I run the inn.
Christiane Amanpour: Very nice to meet you. It's a lovely inn.
LORELAI: Thank you so much. Um I'm sorry to bother you, but my daughter is a huge fan of yours,
she always has been.
Christiane Amanpour: That's very nice to hear. Thank you.
LORELAI: Yeah she just graduated from Yale, actually, where she was the editor of the Yale Daily
News.Christiane Amanpour: That's great.
LORELAI: Anyway, Um she'd love to meet  you, if that's okay.
Christiane Amanpour: I'd love to. Is she here?
LORELAI: Yes, she is. Rory, come here.
[Rory goes out of hiding]
LORELAI: Come on. Okay, here she is. This is Rory Gilmore. Rory, meet Christiane Amanpour.
Christiane Amanpour: Hi, Rory. How are you? Nice to meet you.
RORY: Nice to meet  you, too. I'm sorry to meet you in my pajamas. I don't usually walk around town
like this.
Christiane Amanpour: That's okay.
RORY: I just think you are so inspiring. Your reporting is so bold and moving and fascinating and I
know you've won nine Emmys, but I just don't think that's enough -- not that you care about that
kind of thing, but I just want to say thank you.
Christiane Amanpour: Thank you. That's really nice of you. And your mother says that you've
graduated Yale, editor of the Yale Daily News -- that's not bad.
RORY: Oh, thank you. I want to pursue a career in journalism.
Christiane Amanpour: That's good, is it print you want? Television? CNN, maybe?
RORY: Oh, I'd love to work for a major daily.
Christiane Amanpour: Do you know which one?
RORY: Any one that will take me.
Christiane Amanpour: That's the spirit. I mean you just get in there, do what you can, show them
what you've got, and the rest will take care of itself.
RORY: That's my plan.
Christiane Amanpour: Listen, I don't often do this, but I'm going to give you my card, and if you
want to send me some stuff, I'll have a look at it and you know stay in touch.
RORY: Seriously?
Christiane Amanpour: Yes, yeah.
RORY: Thank you.
[Car horn honks]
Christiane Amanpour: That's my cab out there, so I'm gonna go now. It was really nice to meet you.
[Shaking Lorelai's hand.]LORELAI: Nice to meet  you.
Christiane Amanpour: Nice to meet  you. [Shaking Rory's hand.]
RORY: Nice to meet  you.
Christiane Amanpour: Good luck. Take care.
RORY: Thank you.
LORELAI: Thank you so much.
LORELAI: [Gasps]
RORY: I can't believe I just met Christiane Amanpour in my pajamas.
LORELAI: Well, I'm sure you made an impression.
OPENING CREDITS
LORELAI'S HOUSE – RORY'S ROOM
[Lorelai is on the bed with a Laptop]
LORELAI: All right after "Great Adventure" the next Roller coaster would be here at Lake
Compounds, home of the "Boulder Dash".
RORY: Love it.
LORELAI: "The number one choice of wooden roller coasters" according to Mr Arthur Levin of
about.com.
RORY: Oh yes the venerable Mr Levin, a legend in coast criticism.
LORELAI: So you've heard of him.
RORY: Well of course what coast connoisseur hasn't?
LORELAI: "Great airtime" he says "smooth ride, relentless speed from start to finish" you can admit
it if you're scared.
RORY: What I'm not scared, are you scared?
LORELAI: No I'm not scared, I'm not the one who screams.
RORY: That happened once.
LORELAI: Really busted my eardrums.
RORY: You want to keep talking smack or you want to tell me what comes after the Boulder Dash?
LORELAI: How about the "Cyclone" in Coney Island. And then we can head west to the "Millennium
Force" Ohio, this calls it a "Giga Roller coaster"
RORY: You know what I say, no hands, eyes open that's right you heard me.LORELAI: I'll believe it when I see it.
RORY: Well believe it. Okay I am done, 74 résumé's, addressed and sealed.
LORELAI: Not at all excessive.
RORY: Well I just wanted to make sure I didn't leave a stone unturned.
LORELAI: Yes rocks, pebbles, boulders they've all been turned.
RORY: Well I got it all done before our big trip, can you believe it. OH man I have a lot of books.
LORELAI: Hey there is a cool "State-Fare" coaster in Springfield, 50-mile detour, worth it.
RORY: Hum. Aw [pulls something out of a box].
LORELAI: Aw.
RORY: The rocket.
LORELAI: The rocket... Have you talked to him.
RORY: No. It comes in waves, you know, big ones, really close together.
LORELAI: Well the waves will get smaller, I promise. Just have to give it time you know. Have to
feel sad and get through it.
RORY: Believe me I'm letting myself feel plenty sad.
LORELAI: Oh that's good, I mean it's not good you know, under the circumstances, it's good.
RORY: I just can't imagine it feeling better.
LORELAI: But it will someday I promise.
RORY: Yeah, do you feel better about Luke?
LORELAI: [Not sounding convincing] Ah, yeah I feel better because I think we're done.
RORY: What, maybe you guys just need more time.
LORELAI: More time, I‘ve given him all the time in the world. Every time I'm venerable or I say
something or do something like the song he doesn't do anything.
RORY: Well he's always been a little slow to respond.
LORELAI: Yeah I don't want to make any more excuses you know.
RORY: I just don't think he's over you.
LORELAI: Well it doesn't matter, I'm over him. I need someone who can feel you know, show me how
he feels. He can't do that.
RORY: I guess that make sense.
LORELAI: Anyway we're batter as friends you know, don't you think. Like "Hey Luke can I get somecoffee", you know friends like that. Like "Hey Luke can you make all the burgers for Rory's re-
enactment graduation party?" you know.
RORY: What re-enactment graduation party?
LORELAI: It's just a graduation re-enactment party we're gonna have for all the people who couldn't
go to your actual graduation.
RORY: Re-enactment, how?
LORELAI: All you have to do is throw on that cap and gown again, you know and go up on a little
podium again, that someone is gonna build and listen to the high school band play "Pomp and
Circumstance".
RORY: Mom!
LORELAI: What it's a party, it's gonna be fun!
RORY: Ah, you own me.
LORELAI: Okay I'll get you lots of cotton candy and I won't make fun of you when you scream.
RORY: I'm not gonna scream.
LORELAI: Once a screamer, always a screamer.
RORY: I was seven.
LORELAI: Like that counts.
LUKE'S DINER
LUKE: All right, give me 300 hot dogs, 250 burgers.
CHARLIE: How about brats?
LUKE: No brats. And enough buns, obviously, to go with all that.
CHARLIE: Buns got it, you know brats go over very big at outdoor parties.
LUKE: Yeah well I know the woman throwing the party, and she and her daughter are dogs-and-
burgers people. Al right the party's Saturday, so I want delivery on Friday okay.
CHARLIE: No sweat. I'll give you half off brats.
LUKE: Somebody cancel a big order, Charlie?
CHARLIE: I tried to tell her, "Lady, nobody eats Bratwurst at a wedding."
LUKE: [chuckling] Right. I'll see you, man. Thanks.
[Opens the door for Liz]
CHARLIE: Hey Liz
LIZ: Oh, hey, chuck, how you doing?CHARLIE: I'm good.
LIZ: There's your uncle Lukie! Say, "hi, uncle Lukie!"
LUKE: HI Doula,
LIZ: When she just stares like that, that's her way of saying hi.
LUKE: Works for me. How you doing, Liz?
[Hug and smooch over the counter.]
LIZ: Oh pretty good. How about you?
LUKE: Oh, god, I'm crazed. You want something to eat?
LIZ: No, we just stopped by 'cause Doula misses her uncle Lukie. She really misses him.
LUKE: Yeah look I cannot baby-sit today.
LIZ: [begging] Please! I just need a little break.
LUKE: Come on I'm really swamped today al right. Besides, I'm really trying to lay in the stuff for
Rory's party next week.
LIZ: Please I really want to get something special for that party, and every item of clothing that I
own is covered in spit-up.
LUKE: Sorry.
LIZ: Okay, if you can't do it, you can't do it. So arr, did you give it to her?
LUKE: What?
LIZ: The necklace -- did you give it to Lorelai yet?
LUKE: That was just a backup gift for Rory.
LIZ: Oh come on that was no backup gift. And what about the song?
LUKE: D..d.. f.. forget about the song. The song meant nothing. We're friends. That's it.
LIZ: Oh and you're good with being just friends.
LUKE: Yeah.
LIZ: I don't buy it.
LUKE: Well then maybe you should give her the necklace then. I'm really busy here.
LIZ: Fine, fine. Hey could you mix a sweet potato and a banana in a blender? It's Doula's favorite.
LUKE: Sure. [Goes to make it] And don't slip out while I make it.
GILMORE MANSION – DINNING ROOM[Emily, Lorelai and Richard are eating]
EMILY: I don't see why Rory had to take this meeting during our Friday night dinners.
RICHARD: Emily.
EMILY: Well it's not even an interview. If it was an interview, I would understand, but it's a drink.
LORELAI: It's a contact, mom. She's trying to remind him who she is.
RICHARD: As if anyone could forget.
LORELAI: I know. You know Rory wants to make sure she's got her bases covered before we go out of
town so that she can relax and have fun.
EMILY: But I don't think this drink should eat into our time.
LORELAI: Well maybe we'll stay later.
EMILY: For after-dinner drinks?
LORELAI: [Sounding hazer dent] Maybe.
EMILY: So, how long will you two be gone?
LORELAI: Oh, a couple weeks, a month.
EMILY: You're riding roller coasters for a month?
LORELAI: As long as our stomachs can take it.
EMILY: This is what Yale graduates do?
LORELAI: Mother she's tired. She needs a break. Plus, this might be my last shot.
EMILY: You last shot, what are you talking about?
LORELAI: Well, she's gonna get a job, and who knows where? You know, she's gonna move on. This
might be the last time I can really spend time with her like this.
EMILY: Honestly, Lorelai, must you be so maudlin?
LORELAI: I'm not being maudlin. I'm being realistic.
RICHARD: So, how are things at the inn?
LORELAI: Oh, good. Busy, but good.
EMILY: I have an idea for you.
LORELAI: Oh, no.
EMILY: Hmm?
LORELAI: Oh, no, don't stop there. Go on.EMILY: I think you should add a spa to your inn.
LORELAI: A spa?
EMILY: Yes, spas are exploding.
LORELAI: Sounds dangerous.
EMILY: All of our friends are trading island vacations for spa holidays.
LORELAI: I don't know, mom.
EMILY: When I was the Ballantyne Resort, it got me thinking. This is really something I think you
should do. Small country inns are old news, Lorelai. Destination spas are what everyone's talking
about.
RICHARD: [Nods in agreement]
LORELAI: Mom, I told you business is good. I don't need to rub people with rocks or wrap them in
seaweed.
RICHARD: Well, the travel market is fickle. It wouldn't hurt to stay ahead of the curve.
LORELAI: I don't have the money for expansion. [Doorbell rings] Ooh here she is,
EMILY: Will you at least think about it before you say no?
LORELAI: Yes, I will think about it.
RORY: Hi, sorry I'm late.
RICHARD: Rory.
LORELAI: How were the drinks?
RORY: Good, I got a job.
LORELAI: [Gasps]
EMILY: What tonight?
RICHARD: Tonight?
RORY: I leave in three days. I can't leave in three days.
RICHARD: Whe…Wha…Leave where?
LORELAI: What's the job, honey?
RORY: Well, I was having drinks with Hugo Gray, right?
RICHARD: Who's this Hugo Gray?
LORELAI: He runs an online magazine. Rory's been writing for him.RORY: So we were just talking about different opportunities that might come up and where I've
already applied, and he mentioned that the reporter that was covering the Barack Obama
campaign for him dropped out because his fiancée got a job in Dubai, so they're moving.
LORELAI: Wow!
RORY: So Hugo asked me if  that was something I'd be interested in and I said "yes I would be
interested" and he told me mo re about it and apparently I would be on the campaign trail with the
other reporters -- the planes, the buses, the whole deal. And I mean it's only an online magazine,
so I wouldn't be staying where the Wall Street Journal people stay at night but…
LORELAI: Who cares?
RORY: But I would be traveling with them. I'd be filing stories from the road right up until the
convention.
RICHARD: So have you talked salary yet?
RORY: Yeah, it's next to nothing, but all my meals and travel and hotels would be covered, so I
wouldn't have that many expenses.
RICHARD: Well that's fine. You're just starting out. Plus, it sounds like you'll be making excellent
contacts.
RORY: I would be.
EMILY: It could be quite grueling, Rory -- all that constant travel, the seedy motels.
LORELAI: She can handle it.
RORY: I hope so. I said yes.
LORELAI: That's great.
RORY: It is, right?
LORELAI: Ah you're gonna be working on a presidential campaign.
RORY: I know but that also mean in three days I'd be leaving for who knows how long. It could be
two months, it could be two years if Barack does well. And what does that mean -- I'm only gonna
come home on holidays? That's crazy. And I need some transition time, and the roller coasters --
how am I gonna go on all the roller coasters if I have to leave and have to be in Iowa on Monday at
the town hall meet ing at the Quality Inn and Suites Ballroom in Sioux City?
LORELAI: You're gonna be fine.
RORY: [Sighs] What about the roller coasters?
LORELAI: We'll do it another time. This is what you've been working for.
RORY: Yeah. I guess it is. [Sighs] I would have credentials -- real press credentials. Isn't that crazy?
LORELAI: It's not crazy.
EMILY: So, this is it. This is the last time we'll see you for who knows how long.RORY: Oh, yeah, I guess it is.
[A few moments of silence]
LORELAI: After-dinner drinks for sure.
RICHARD: [Raising his glass] Hear, hear.
LUKE'S DINER
[Lorelai and Rory enter]
RORY: But this list they gave me is  just ridiculous. Where am I gonna find a laptop car adapter by
tomorrow?
LORELAI: 24-hour laptop-car-adapter store.
RORY: Seriously, mom.
LORELAI: Well honey that's our mission today. We'll buy or borrow. Hey, Caesar, is Luke around?
CAESAR: Sure. How are we today, ladies?
LORELAI: Fine.
RORY: We'll be finer with a little coffee.
LORELAI: Two to go, please.
CAESAR: With pleasure. Hey, Luke, you got company. Here, let me take that.
[Caesar grabs hold of some plates Luke is carrying]
LUKE: I got it.
CAESAR: Let me.
LUKE: I'm fine.
CAESAR: It's not a problem.
LUKE: It's becoming one. Take it. All right.
CAESAR: Sorry.
LUKE: Hey. [Tot Lorelai] Hey, Rory!
RORY: Hi.
LORELAI: Hi, what was all that about?
LUKE: Oh he's just trying to show me he can handle things, you know if I leave.
LORELAI: If?
LUKE: Well t he boat trip's been cancelled, but Caesar's got it in his head that I'm gonna leave atsome point so he can prove he can -- whatever.
CAESAR: Java one, java two.
LORELAI: Thanks [Too Luke] So, Luke... [Sighs] Remember all the burgers and hot dogs I ordered for
Rory's party a week from Saturday?
LUKE: Yeah, sure.
LORELAI: I have to cancel them.
LUKE: Why?
LORELAI: Well the party's cancelled.
KIRK: Wait a second, did you just say Rory's graduation party is cancelled?
LORELAI: Oh ho, it's good news. [Pointing to Rory] Someone got a job.
LULU: What job?
RORY: I'm gonna be a reporter for an online magazine.
LORELAI: Oh it's better than that -- she's going to Iowa, and she's gonna be on the campaign bus
with Barack Obama.
[Blank looks and silence from Kirk, Lulu, Babette and Miss Patty sitting at some tables]
BABETTE: No party at all?
LORELAI: Babette.
LUKE: Congratulations. That's great news.
RORY: Thank you. Yeah I'm really excited, but I'm nervous. I have to be a real reporter, yikes.
LUKE: You'll be a great one.
LORELAI: She will, so, sorry, but no Rory, no party.
BABETTE: But you promised us a re-enactment.
KIRK: We can still do the re-enactment. Remember my suggestion -- Lulu plays Rory?
MISS PATTY: It's not the same, Kirk. And I was so looking forward to having a good cry at the re-
enactment..
LORELAI: Uh, okay. You want a re-enactment? We can, we can give you one right, right now. Uh
come on, Rory. Okay, so watch this. [Sings "pomp and circumstance"] Okay, and, everybody, the
graduate, Lorelai Leigh Gilmore. Ooh. Ooh. Here you go. And shake the hand.
RORY: Thank you.
LORELAI: Thank you. And you are one of tomorrow's future leaders today.
RORY: I am so happy. I am so glad to have graduated Summa-cum-Luke.LORELAI: And then the thing. [mimin g the moving of the tassel on the hat] Okay. Yay!
BABETTE: That's not how I imagined it.
LORELAI: I'm sorry, guys. I wish we could do the party. I really do. We just don't have time. She's
leaving in two days.
MISS PATTY: Two days?
RORY: I know. It's really soon.
LORELAI: We just have a lot to do.
BABETTE: So this is goodbye?
RORY: No this isn't goodbye, I'm gonna come by tomorrow and visit everybody. I'm not ready for this
to be the real goodbye.
LORELAI: Yeah this is more like a "see you later."
RORY: Yeah, I'll see you guys later.
LORELAI: Okay? So see you later.
[They get their coffees and stuff.]
RORY: Bye
LUKE: See ya.
BABETTE: Bye, dollfaces. [Heavily sighs] No party.
[Luke also looks sad]
DRAGONFLY INN - KITCHEN
[Sookie is cooking, Luke enters]
LUKE: Hey.
SOOKIE: Hey, Luke, how's it going?
LUKE: Good. It's going good. How are you?
SOOKIE: Ooh Good. Hey, I apologize for the smell in here, but I'm making bouillabaisse. It's kind of
at the stinkiest part -- a lot of uncooked fish and garlic.
LUKE: It smells good to me.
SOOKIE: Well you're very kind. You looking for Lorelai? 'Cause she's out and about, and I don't know
when she's coming back.
LUKE: Yeah, I know. I saw her in town.
SOOKIE: Oh.LUKE: Yeah.
SOOKIE: Yeah. So, what's up?
LUKE: Well, you know she cancelled Rory's graduation party?
SOOKIE: Yeah. I mean I knew that kid wouldn't last a whole summer at home before landing some
kind of amazing job, but, god, it happened so lightning fast.
LUKE: You know I was thinking maybe we should throw it anyway.
SOOKIE: Oh, yeah?
LUKE: Yeah, I mean it's a week sooner than we planned, but there's no reason we can't do it.
SOOKIE: I guess not.
LUKE: And I think we should make it a surprise party.
SOOKIE: Who doesn't love a surprise?
LUKE: Yeah I got all the hot dogs and the hamburgers, and the buns are on their way today anyway.
SOOKIE: You know, that's a very sweet idea Luke.
LUKE: Yeah, I think Rory would really love it.
SOOKIE: I think Lorelai would love it.
LUKE: Yeah, Rory and Lorelai.
SOOKIE: Yeah, Rory and Lorelai.
[Giggles and chuckles]
SOOKIE: I think we should do it!
LUKE: Yeah.
SOOKIE: Yeah, yeah.
LUKE: All right. I'll start telling everybody.
SOOKIE: Okay what do you need from me?
LUKE: Desserts.
SOOKIE: Aha! Well, I'm all over it.
LUKE: Okay.
SOOKIE: Give Jackson a call.
LUKE: Okay.SOOKIE: He'll help you with whatever you need.
LUKE: Al right Okay, thanks, Sookie.
SOOKIE: Okay.
LUKE: All right, bye.
STARS HOLLOW – NEAR WESTON'S
[Lorelai and Rory are walking]
RORY: I don't know, I think it would have made more sense to get a regular-sized shampoo bottle
instead of 20 tiny ones.
LORELAI: With the big bottle you got to lug it off and on the bus.
RORY: Lug! How big do they make them?
LORELAI: Look the little bottles give you as much shampoo without the weight. Perfect for travel --
plus, they're cute.
RORY: Al right. Oh, I want to stop by the post office. I want to get tons of blank postcards. You are
gonna get so many postcards.
LORELAI: You could just e-mail me.
RORY: Yeah but postcard-sending is a dying art form. Right, and it's nice to get mail.
LORELAI: Sure.
RORY: Plus, we'll talk all the time.
LORELAI: Yeah. What else do you need?
RORY: Um, a mini book light. Ah man I had a mini book light, but I lent it to Paris. And by "lent," I
mean she totally stole it.
LORELAI: I think we have a mini book light in the lost and found at the inn. It's been there like a
month.
RORY: Oh poor rejected book light.
LORELAI: Maybe you should adopt it and give it the love it needs.
RORY: All right. Check.
LORELAI: What else do we need? Ooh, hey, I have a great idea. Come here.
RORY: What, where are we going?
[They head towards Miss Pattys.]
LORELAI: Rememb er last year when Miss Patty hurt her back during rehearsal for spring fling?
RORY: Oh yeah she should have never demonstrated the Jetés for the little daffodils.LORELAI: She had one of those back-support things that you put on top of chairs. I bet she'd loan
that to you.
RORY: Yeah but do I really want to be known as "back-support-thingy girl"?
LORELAI: AH, hello, two-hour speech, metal folding chairs, and now I'll take questions for an hour.
RORY: Just call me "back-support-thingy girl."
[Lorelai knocks on the door, no response]
LORELAI: That's weird. She never locks this.
RORY: Miss Patty?
LORELAI: Miss Patty?
[Lorelai knocks again as the door opens just enough for miss Patty to stick her head out]
MICHEL: Oh, hello, girls.
LORELAI: Hi, is everything okay?
LORELAI: Oh, yes, everything is fine. I'M...consulting with my muse.
RORY: Your muse?
MISS PATTY: Yes! whenever I want to think up a new dance routine, I come in here alone, lie down
on the floor in the dark, and I let the muse inspire me. Did you want something?
LORELAI: That's okay, we'll come back when you're not with your muse.
MISS PATTY: Okay, good.
LORELAI: Okay, well, so we'll...
[The door is abruptly slid close]
LORELAI: [To a closed door] See you later.
RORY: Odd.
LORELAI: Very odd.
MISS PATTY‘S
[They whole meet ing is lined up against the wall so if Lorelai looked in eh would no see them]
MISS PATTY: Okay, they're gone.
BABETTE: Good. Let's get this meet ing going.
[The lights are turned on and they start to take their seats.]
TAYLOR: Once again, this is not a "meet ing," per se. We have already broken several Robert's rulesof order.
BABETTE: So don't tell Robert.
LANE: Yeah besides, isn't it worth breaking rules over? It is Rory, for god's sake.
BABETTE: So lets start divvying up the duties, who's gonna do the food?
LUKE: I got hot dogs and hamburgers and a couple of big grills in the square, and Sookie's got the
rest covered, right Jackson?
JACKSON: She's at home baking right now. You name the fruit, it'll be in one of her pies.
[Murmurs from the crowd]
MOREY: Can she make a sour-cream/peach pie?
JACKSON: I'll put it on the list.
KIRK: I'd like a blackberry.
JACKSON: Oh she makes a wicked blackberry and cranberry.
MISS PATTY: What about cherry? Cherry is a classic.
[The crowd all talking at once]
TAYLOR: Please, could we stay focused? People, this gathering is unofficial, as such I would like to
have it over with as soon as possible. Now, Luke, I assume you have obtained permits to use two
large grills with open flame on our town square?
LUKE: [Flustered] Uh, no, I don't, I don't have any permits. I just, I just started this whole thing a
couple hours ago.
TAYLOR: Outdoor barbecuing sans permit is a violation of town codes. As selectman, I can't approve
that.
[The crowd complains.]
BABETTE: Hey Taylor If this meet ing is unofficial, then whatever you say is unofficial, so Luke's
barbecuing, what else.
LANE: Music. There's got to be music.
LUKE: Yeah, who's got a good sound system?
MOREY: Yo!
KIRK: I believe I can also be of some help in this area. I'd gladly donate my time and expertise as
deejay. Did a little deejay work back in college. Went by the moniker "Captain K."
LULU: He's really good at scratching.
BABETTE: Yeah we've all seen that.
LUKE: Okay what about decorations?LULU: I have a bunch of stuff left from a school birthday party – Mylar balloons, streamers.
TAYLOR: There are not going to be any Mylar balloons. They are infamous for floating up and
catching on power lines. It could cause an outage for the whole town.
MOREY: The closest power lines are six miles out of town.
[The crowd complains again.]
TAYLOR: Nonetheless…
LUKE: [Standing up] Nonetheless, Lulu, why don't you bring those balloons and whatever else you
got?
TAYLOR: You people are violating town ordinances left and right. This is highly irregular.
ZACH: Dude, you're who's highly irregular.
[Crowd all shouting]
TAYLOR: Excuse me?
LUKE: I don't know what your problem is, but the town wants to throw this party, and you're either
gonna join us or you're gonna stay home and comb your beard.
[Crowed all shouting]
LUKE: Okay, all right, we're gonna need chairs and tables and volunteers to set them up around the
gazebo. Okay we're all gonna get started in the square tonight after dark, okay?
[All talking at once, as they get up to start work on the party.]
TAYLOR: This will remain an unofficial party, you hear men, unofficial!
STARS HOLLOW - TOWN SQUARE
[Nighttime, Lorelai and Rory walking]
RORY: You should come al ong. It would be fun.
LORELAI: No you need some al one time with Lane.
RORY: Yeah but it's cutting into our you-and-me time.
LORELAI: There's plenty of time.
RORY: 36 hours is not plenty of time.
LORELAI: That's not true. Imagine if you had a 36-hour flight. That would seem like a long time,
right?
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: All right plus, I have to go to Sookie and Jackson's to get you that fanny pack.
RORY: Really?LORELAI: What "really"?
RORY: You honestly think I'm gonna wear a fanny pack?
LORELAI: All I know is, it's on the list, and if it's on the list, I'm getting it for you. You think Tom
Brokaw's mother sent him off to his first campaign with no fanny pack?
RORY: When, when in my right mind would I…
LORELAI: Perhaps the senator might like a piece of gum, and no one has any, and then they say,
"what about that girl with the lime-green fanny pack?"
[oblivious to the girls some townies start moving tables in the back ground, they see the girls, turn
and leave before they see them]
RORY: "Lime-green" I would be "Lime-green fanny pack girl."
LORELAI: And they bring you over to him, and he says, [using a mans voice] "Hello young lady, what
is your name?" [Pretending to be Rory] "My name's Rory Gilmore. Here's your gum." [Normal voice]
And like that, you're gum buddies with the future president of the United States!
RORY: Oh when you put it that way -- gum buddies.
LORELAI: All right look, I'll meet  you back at home, okay?
RORY: Okay but take a nap, 'cause we're staying up really late.
LORELAI: I don't need a nap to stay up really late.
RORY: Okay.
LORELAI: Give my love to Lane and the boys.
[They kiss on the cheeks]
RORY: I will. Bye.
LORELAI: Bye.
[Lorelai looks around to where the townies were with the table but they have long gone.]
LANE AND ZACH'S APARTMENT – EXTERIOR
[Lane and Rory seated on a bench]
LANE: Billy Fink.
RORY: You did not!
LANE: I did.
RORY: But Dave Rogalski.
LANE: Not technically my first kiss.RORY: How did I not know this?
LANE: I was too ashamed to ever tell you. I mean how would you feel if your first kiss was Billy
Fink?
RORY: Well just 'cause he didn't come out of the gates strong doesn't mean he didn't turn into a very
handsome, dashing billionaire.
LANE: He didn't, I ran into him a few years ago, and he's living with his mom and sells shoes in
Norwich.
RORY: Oh. Well, maybe he'll sell billions of shoes.
LANE: [Chuckles] How weird is this? Yesterday we're sitting on your porch playing jacks and praying
to grow boobs, and now look at us. I have a husband and two babies in there, and you're about to
go off and conquer the world, or at least write about it.
RORY: We've come a l ong way, baby.
LANE: I'll say.
ZACH: Babe.
LANE: Yeah.
ZACH: Can I talk to you a sec?
LANE: Sure what's up?
ZACH: In private.
LANE: Oh, well, I'll be right back.
RORY: Okay.
ZACH: Sorry, Rory.
RORY: No problem.
[Lane goes inside]
LANE: The kids okay?
ZACH: Sound asleep.
LANE: They what's going on?
ZACH: I just got a call from Luke, and they want to start setting up the square for tomorrow.
LANE: Yeah so?
ZACH: So the honoree is sitting on our porch looking out onto the square, and they can't set up until
she goes home.
LANE: It's my last night with my best friend.[Lane starts walking outside]
ZACH: Well, could you move it along, because it's getting late and we were just trying…[[Lane stops
and turns to look at Zach] Hey, I'm just the messenger. [Lane looking mad] You're done when you're
done. I'll let them know.
LANE: U-Hmm.
[Lane goes outside again.]
LANE: Sorry about that. [Seeing Rory sad] What's wrong?
RORY: I don't know. In the past two minutes sitting here, I've managed to completely freak myself
out. The call I haven't really had a chance to stop and think about it, but I just stopped and
thought, and I am really nervous.
LANE: Totally understandable.
RORY: But I'm, like, panic-attack nervous.
LANE: Rory, you're gonna do an amazing job, okay? You always do.
RORY: See? I hate that.
LANE: What?
RORY: Everyone thinking I'm gonna do an amazing job all the time, like it's a given. It's not a given.
What if I'm a terrible reporter?
LANE: Then you'll figure out how to get better. [Sighs] Rory, the reason why everybody knows you're
gonna do an amazing job is because everybody knows you. Yeah, you're gonna be nervous. I mean I
was nervous before I had the babies. I was throwing up all the time.
RORY: You were pregnant.
LANE: True, but that was 30% pregnancy, 70% fear of being the world's worst mom.
RORY: I don't know. I just don't know about just picking up and leaving until who knows when and
leaving my mom -- see? I'm not ready. What reporter freaks out about leaving their mom?
LANE: The lucky kind.
RORY: It's embarrassing.
LANE: How is she holding up?
RORY: She's fine. She's not freaked out at all. She's making lists and buying fanny packs. She's not
even a little bit sentimental.
LANE: Your mom?
RORY: Yeah. She's really fine.
LANE: I'm sure she's freaking out on the inside.
RORY: I don't know. Maybe. [short pause] Lane...LANE: Yeah?
RORY: I just… your friendship means so much to me. It's so...
LANE: Me, too.
RORY: I mean, I don't know what it's like to have a sister, but I feel like I do, you know?
LANE: Yeah.
RORY: Mrs. Van Gerbig.
LANE: Ms. Gilmore.
LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Rory enters]
RORY: Hey.
LORELAI: Oh, hey!
RORY: You're ironing?
LORELAI: The flatter the clothes, the more will fit in your suitcase.
RORY: Oh right.
LORELAI: How was Lane's?
RORY: It was sad, saying goodbye.
LORELAI: I'll bet. Oh Sookie wants you to come by tomorrow and say goodbye to her. I made her a
promise that you would.
RORY: Sure.
LORELAI: And I got that fanny pack from Jackson. I think you're right. -- you're never gonna wear it
unless you want to be relentlessly teased but the other reporters.
RORY: Not so much.
LORELAI: But who knows? Maybe you should take it. You know maybe they're teasing reporters who
don't have fanny packs. Who knows what the reporter teasing edict is these days.
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: Yeah?
RORY: I don't get it.
LORELAI: What?
RORY: How can you be so okay with everything? Ever since I've told you that I'm leaving, you're just
all busy with shopping and packing, and you seem fine with it.LORELAI: [Sighs] It's too soon.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: If I stop to think about you leaving now, I'm gonna fall apart. We still have time left. It's
too soon.
[A few moments silence]
RORY: Here. I'll iron. You fold.
STARS HOLLOW – TOWN SQUARE
LUKE: Hey, guys, only six chairs to a table.
ZACH: I think we can go eight if we grab more from the high school.
BRIAN: The door's chained, but I can slip through, I'm skinny like that.
LUKE: Six is fine. Not everybody's gonna be sitting down at once.
MISS PATTY: We found enough tablecloths.
LUKE: Great.
WOMAN: It turns out that East-Side Tillie had a stash down in her basement.
MISS PATTY: Woke her up out of a dead sleep. She couldn't have been more annoyed. It was
fantastic.
LUKE: Thanks.
ASIAN CAESAR: Hey Luke, I got the turntable. What's next?
LUKE: Why don't you help Kirk and Lulu with the lights.
ASIAN CAESAR: Okay will do.
LUKE: Kirk, careful stringing those lights, okay? One of those light bulbs blows, and the whole
thing's useless.
JACKSON: Luke, what do you think about these?
LUKE: What do I think about what?
JACKSON: The centerpieces.
LUKE: Oh nice.
JACKSON: Sookie's idea, my vegetables.
LUKE: All right, great. Thanks.
BABETTE: Luuuuuke! Luke! [Running up]LUKE: Yeah, Babette, over here.
BABETTE: Oh, Luke! My ankles! Look at my ankles!
LUKE: Should I ask why?
BABETTE: Bad news, doll, it's gonna rain.
LUKE: What?
BABETTE: Oh, yeah look at these ankles. They haven't been this swollen since hurricane bob. So
then I checked the weather channel, and sure enough, Nick Walker confirmed it. There's a storm
front moving in over Connecticut.
LUKE: It's gonna rain tomorrow?
BABETTE: First thing in the AM, Nick Walker -- you a Nick Walker fan?
LUKE: No.
BABETTE: Oh, you should be. He's just terrific -- always dead on and so charming. Of course, I've
always had a thing for meteorologists. They're kinda like astronauts crossed with fortune tellers,
very intriguing Anyway, he says it's definite.
LUKE: Oh.
BABETTE: Yeah, so I thought you'd want to know. Sorry for the bad news, but you know my ankles.
LUKE: No, that's true. They're never wrong.
BABETTE: No, no, My hair's only 50-50, but my ankles -- you could take them to the bank.
MISS PATTY: What we gonna do?
ZACH: We could have it in the diner.
LUKE: How you gonna fit 200 people in a diner?
ZACH: In shifts?
BABETTE: Oh what a shame.
BRIAN: Maybe we can break the party up into people's houses, like little party stations.
LUKE: You gonna wake up the whole town and arrange that?
BRIAN: It sounded dumb while I was saying it.
LUKE: I can't believe it's gonna rain tomorrow.
JACKSON: You don't suppose anybody has any idea where we could get a big wedding tent at one
o'clock in the morning?
BABETTE: [Sighs]
ZACH: It was a nice idea, man.[Luke is deep in thought]
LORELAI'S HOUSE – RORY'S ROOM
[Lorelai comes to the door and looks at Rory sleeping, then sits on her bed, almost crying.]
LUKE'S DINER
[Luke is sewing together lots of tarps and stuff.] He goes to the draw and pulls out the necklace
box.]
STARS HOLLOW – TOWN SQUARE
[Lorelai and Rory in the Jeep, it raining heavy]
RORY: Why is no one picking up their phones? I want to say goodbye to everyone.
LORELAI: We'll track them all down, I promise. [Gasps] Rory, look.
[Just about the whole town is under a giant tent cheering, there is a Bon Voyage sign to Rory.]
LORELAI: I think you're gonna get to say goodbye to everybody.
[Cheering continues as Zach and Jackson come out to the Jeep with umbrellas.]
RORY: Did you...
LORELAI: No, I didn't do a thing.
[Cheers and applause as the girls run back to the tent with the guys. They girls look on in
amazement.]
LANE: We love you, Rory!
[Indistinct shouting as the camera pans the crowd.]
LORELAI: Whoo!
RORY: Whoo! Yeah!
GYPSY: We love you, Rory!
BABETTE: We're so proud of you.
[Shouting continues]
LORELAI: Wow.
RORY: Wow.
[The cheering dies down]
KIRK: Rory, in my official capacity as town sash presenter, I would like to present you with this sash,
which I also happened to make in my official capacity as town sash maker.RORY: Well, thank you.
KIRK: Kneel before me. [Rory looks concerned] All right, could you at least bow your head a little
bit?
LORELAI: Wow. That's quite a sash.
KIRK: I got the material from one of mother's nighties.
RORY: Ew!
MISS PATTY: We wouldn't let you go without a party, sweetheart!
BABETTE: All right, no shoving. Let's make a line. Everybody gets a chance to hug Rory.
LORELAI: I see mom and dad. I'll be right back.
[Emily and Richard are standing alone off to the side.]
LORELAI: Hey.
RICHARD: This is quite a party.
LORELAI: I know. It is, isn't it?
EMILY: We had to cancel a lunch with the Stuttgart's because we only heard about it from Sookie
last night.
RICHARD: Emily, that hardly matters.
EMILY: I didn't say it mattered. I was merely relaying the fact.
LORELAI: Well, anyway, I'm glad you're here.
RICHARD: We wouldn't miss it.
EMILY: Of course we wouldn't. We're her grandparents.
LORELAI: I can't believe they did this for her.
RICHARD: I don't think this is all for Rory. I think this party's a testament to you, Lorelai, and the
home you've created here. I regret that you needed…
EMILY: Richard.
RICHARD: Now, let me finish, Emily. I regret it, and we've…recent experience have taught me…
EMILY: Oh, please don't become one of those "I had a heart attack, let me express my every
thought" types.
RICHARD: Not every thought, dear, just this one. It takes a r-- [Voice breaking] A remarkable person
to inspire all of this.
LORELAI: Thanks, dad.
[A few moments silence]EMILY: Okay, that's enough. It's not as though the two of you are saying goodbye.
TAYLOR: May I have your attention, please? I'd like to welcome you all to this Bon Voyage party in
honor of one of Stars Hollow's favorite daughters, Ms. Rory Gilmore!
[Cheers and applause]
RICHARD: Brava! Brava!
TAYLOR: I've known Rory, as have most of you...
EMILY: Have you given any thought to my spa idea?
LORELAI: Oh, yeah. I don't think I'm interested, though.
TAYLOR: ...Glorious spring day, pregnant with pride and anticipation, preparing to birth you from
our collective womb, fully gestated and nourished. And so we breathe deep, and, with these last,
painful contractions, we push you out into the world, spank your bottom, and wipe the amniotic
fluid from your eyes as you issue your first independent breath.
EMILY: Is this speech making you a little queasy?
LORELAI: A little bit.
TAYLOR: Rory, would you like to say a few words?
[Cheers and applause]
RORY: Thank you, Taylor, for that very unique tribute. Um... I love this place. I...I just loved
growing up here, and I love all of you. And thank you so much for doing all of this. It's amazing. I
just -- it's so -- oh, I'm on the verge of gushing, so I'm just gonna stop myself here. I don't want to
gush, except one more thing -- to my mom, who is just everything to me and everything I am and
who I'm gonna miss so much.
[Lorelai looks on almost crying, she nods]
TAYLOR: [Chuckles] All right, let's get this party started.
[Later, the rain has stopped and it's nighttime, Kool & the g*ng's "celebration" plays, people are
dancing, we pan to see Luke serving with Lorelai nearby.]
WOMAN: No bratwurst?
LUKE: No bratwurst.
WOMAN: Just corn, then.
LUKE: What can I get you?
LORELAI: Can't decide.
MAN: Hey Luke, I'll have two hamburgers, medium rare.
LUKE: Hold on a sec.EMILY: Lorelai, we really should be going, but I want to say goodbye to Rory.
LORELAI: I guess I'll eat later.
EMILY: Now, listen, instead of a spa, what about a tennis court? People love tennis. You could put a
bubble over it.
LORELAI: Oh, god.
EMILY: Outside the inn you could use it during the summer and winter. There's really no downside.
LORELAI: Um-hmm.
EMILY: Now it's expensive, but your father and I have discussed it, and we are willing to loan you
the money.
LORELAI: Oh, mother.
EMILY: Standard terms, no interest.
LORELAI: Mom, why do you want to loan me money?
EMILY: All it would require is the three of us sit down and hash out the details. Obviously we want
to get together with you from time to time to see how things are progressing, but we wouldn't
become pests about it.
LORELAI: Mom, why don't we just talk about it Friday night at dinner?
EMILY: Oh, so our Friday-night dinners are going to continue, then?
LORELAI: Well, we might as well. I've kind of gotten used to it.
EMILY: All right. That sounds fine. But don't be late and don't wear jeans.
LORELAI: When have I ever worn jeans to dinner?
EMILY: Well I don't know, it could very well be Rory who enforces the dress code. I'm just saying I
don't think that jeans are appropriate.
LORELAI: Fine, spandex and a tube top it is.
RORY: Hey.
LORELAI: Hey.
RICHARD: My dear.
EMILY: Oh, thank you. Now, listen, you keep in touch, and not just postcards -- phone calls as well.
RORY: Of course.
EMILY: It's an honor to be your grandmother, Rory Gilmore.
RORY: Well, thank you, I… thank you for everything.
EMILY: Oh, dear.RORY: I'll walk you guys to your car.
[Music "Celebrate good times, come on"]
SOOKIE: Hey.
LORELAI: Hey!
SOOKIE: It's beautiful, isn't it?
LORELAI: It's so beautiful. I can't believe you pulled it off.
SOOKIE: No, I just did all the baking. This was all Luke.
LORELAI: What?
SOOKIE: He made me promise not to tell you, but I don't care. This is all Luke. He did all of it. He's
the one that came to me an d said, "let's do the party," and then he planned the secret town
meet ing, everything.
LORELAI: Really?
SOOKIE: Yeah. I mean last night when we thought it was gonna rain and we'd have to cancel the
party, he went around and collected everybody's tarps and tents and raincoats. I don't know how he
did it. He must have stayed up all night doing this. Can you believe that?
LORELAI: Yeah… I'll be back.
SOOKIE: Okay.
LORELAI: Hey, Kirk.
KIRK: [Yelling] I can't hear you! My eardrum popped!
TAYLOR: Lorelai, if you see Luke, tell him that he and he alone is responsible for all party cleanup.
LORELAI: Okay.
BABETTE: Lorelai, you want to make a Morey sandwich?
LORELAI: Maybe later, Babette.
[Music, Jackson 5 "Let me show you what it's all about reading and writing, arithmetic". Luke exits
the diner, Lorelai walks up to him. The Mighty Lemon Drops' "Inside Out" plays]
LORELAI: Hey.
LUKE: Hey.
[Both sigh]
LORELAI: Thank you.
LUKE: Oh, it's...no big deal.LORELAI: Luke.
LUKE: I just... like to see you happy.
[Luke and Lorelai move in at the same time and they kiss. Holding each other tight as the volume
of the music playing rises so does the camera to show to party in the background lyrics "You can't
stop my heart from turning inside out try and stop my world from turning inside out you can't stop
my heart from turning inside out"]
LORELAI'S HOUSE – LIVING ROOM
LORELAI: Okay, you have these. Oh, honey, let me help you with that.
RORY: I got it.
LORELAI: Oh, no, I got it.
RORY: I know how to work a zipper, mom.
LORELAI: Okay. That's it, huh?
RORY: Yep.
LORELAI: Got everything?
RORY: I think so.
LORELAI: Oh, what about this?
RORY: That's for the plane.
LORELAI: Oh, how about these?
RORY: Um, those are old and broken. I have new ones.
LORELAI: I just feel like I need more time.
RORY: I know.
LORELAI: I really just feel ambushed, you know? I thought I had so much more...time. I thought I
had all summer  to impart my wisdom about work and life and your future, and I feel like I had
something to tell you. Oh, on the bus, make sure you choose a good seat, you know because people
are creatures of habit, and the seat you pick in the beginning could be your seat for the rest of the
year. You know. Get a window seat, honey, 'cause there's so much to see. And you might want to sit
in the back, because people there tend to be more chatty and friendly and -- I don't know what it is
about the front of the bus, you know but people there just tend to be a little more bossy and
uptight. It's just been that way since first grade. And, honey, I know what you're gonna say, but just
don't wear shorts, okay no matter how hot it is. It's not professional, and all that heat and those
sticky vinyl seats -- it'll be like ripping a band-aid off your thigh every time you stand up. Don't be
too shy. Don't be too forward, but don't be too shy, 'cause you make a lovely first impression, but
you really grow on people, too.
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: You need ziplock bags. You should have them all the time, they're so handy.RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: And I'm gonna give you that orange sweater. I know you've wanted it, and I'm you know
what finally gonna give it to you.
RORY: Mom…You've given me ev erything I need.
LORELAI: [Sighs] Okay.
RORY: Okay.
LORELAI: Shall we?
RORY: What's the rush? It's, like, 5:00 A.M.
LORELAI: Got a stop to make.
[Lorelai grabs the bags and exits, followed by Rory who takes one quick last look.]
LUKE'S DINER
[Luke is pouring coffee for Lorelai and Rory.]
RORY: Mmm. The coffee smells good.
LORELAI: Hello, old friend.
LUKE: How is it?
RORY: Mmm.
LORELAI: Your first pot is always your best.
LUKE: Good.
RORY: Thanks for opening up the place.
LUKE: I got to take care of my best customers.
RORY: [giggles]
LUKE: So, you guys know what you want?
LORELAI: Oh, hmm, I have no idea.
RORY: Looks like a delightful menu.
LORELAI: Oh, it does look delightful, charming.
RORY: Very charming, adorable fonts.
LORELAI: I wish there were pictures.
LUKE: Hmm.
LORELAI: You know, I'm gonna need a minute. I can't decide.All times are UTC-05:00
Page 1 of 1LUKE: Take all the time you need.
[Rory smiles as Luke walks away from the table.]
LORELAI: But could we get some eg gs and bacon and hash browns to tide us over?
LUKE: Coming up.
LORELAI: And pancakes?
RORY: Hey, I like your necklace.
LORELAI: Oh, you do?
[Lorelai looks over her shoulder towards the kitchen]
RORY: It suits you.
LORELAI: Thanks. Hey you got to be careful when you drink coffee on the bus, it's bumpy.
RORY: I can handle it.
LORELAI: I should have gotten you a sippy cup.
RORY: Maybe I should get a flask.
LORELAI: Do they make flasks for hot beverages?
RORY: Yeah they're called thermoses.
LORELAI: Right, I'll get you a thermos that says "World's Greatest Reporter" to match your cap.
RORY: Oh, yeah, I meant to tell you that I left that cap at home.
LORELAI: What?
RORY: Well It wasn't very flattering.
LORELAI: Well how will people know you're the world's greatest reporter?
RORY: I don't know.
LORELAI: I guess they'll just have to read your stuff.
RORY: I guess so.
[The camera pulls back as the girls continue to talk, Luke gets their breakfast ready in the
background.]
